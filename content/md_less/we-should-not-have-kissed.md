We, should not have kissed.


In this weeks local paper, was a drawing of two young people, and the caption, STAY SAFE make sure you stay 2 meters apart.
That gave me the idea, to write this story.


We, should not have kissed


I am Mandy, a well developed young woman, with nice big brown eyes, beautiful hair. 
Knowing I look good enough ,to have won a couple of small, beauty contests, which I did. 
I am in my last year of high school, and after graduating, hoping to go to university.
My mind is is almost made up, that I like to study botany, and forestry, I like trees and plants, and think, would like to get into forestry.
I have a boy friend, Tim, the captain of the football team.
Tim, is a big, handsome looking guy, and we have regular dates.
I don't like dating during the week, my studies, are to important, because before you know it, and it will be time, that we have to write our final exams.


Then, the worst thing happened, the corona virus is taking over, and now all the schools are closed.
Thank goodness, a couple of weeks later, I was informed, that the teachers of our school, will be teaching on line, so we can get ready, for our final exams, and not lose a whole year of school.
I don't like the curfew, but we have no choice, and I am, staying home, and keep busy.
Staying in contact with your friends, is so easy now, phones, and internet, 
What I miss, is my regular visits, with my girlfriend, Anita.
She informed me, and send me a selfie, of her wearing glasses now, I knew she had an eye exam , and was prescribed glasses.
Anita told me, that her glasses were ready, the day the schools closed, and is really happy to have the glasses.
She likes the looks of them, and she still cannot believe, how wearing glasses, can improve your vision so much.
I liked the selfie, that she send me, she looks so attractive wearing glasses, and I told her, I can't wait to come, and see her.
Anita, you look great wearing glasses, I like the frame you selected, you look fantastic.


Tim, my boy friend, is not very happy, about all the restrictions, and keeps asking me, when we can meet again, and go for a drive or something. 
I told him again, that I don't think so, it will be best, if we keep our distance and stay safe ,so I refused.


About a week later, Tim came to my house, to see me, when I sure did not expect, or wanted him to come for a visit.
I asked him, to keep the proper distance, but there was no stopping Tim, he was not satisfied, until he had kissed me, a couple of times, which I did not want, but he did anyway.
He was very upset, about my lack of co-operation, and when he left, called me, an ice queen.
I was glad, he had left, his ego is so big at times, he thinks, he is the picture of health, and he is perfect, and can do what ever he wants.


About a couple of weeks later, I felt feverish, my mother told me to stay in bed, and drink lots of fluids.
My temperature kept going up, and I started to have trouble breathing, I was infected, by the corona virus.
Thank goodness, my mother stayed in regular touch, with our doctor.
When, mother mentioned my breathing difficulties, he made arrangements for an ambulance, to take me to the hospital.
It was not long after, that I needed the use of a ventilator.
With the medication, they used on me, my high fever slowly went down, and I was removed from the ventilator, and the smiling nurses, told me to eat all my meals, so I would be better soon, and be able to go home.
I started to feel better, but one thing, that really bothered me, my vision was not the same.
I always had good vision, and regular eye exams.
When, the doctor, came to see me, I mentioned my vision problem to him. 
He told me that some people, who experienced a period of high fever, 
some times, find their vision is affected, and you will have to see your eye doctor, after you get home. and are healthy again. 
A few days later, I was send home.


Soon, I was healthy enough, to resume some of my activities, but they did not go to well, my vision had changed so much, to read anything, I had to put my nose almost touching the page to read, and sitting in any room, anything, any distance away was very fuzzy,
My mother, who wears glasses for reading, could not understand, why when she gave me her glasses to wear, I could not see properly. 
Mother, did the best thing, when she managed, to get the eye doctor, to give me a vision exam.
I had talked to Anita, and after I told her all about my poor vision, told me, that it sounded to her, that I was very myopic right now, and had to get glasses.
You will be glad when you get glasses, there is nothing better, then a nice pair of prescription glasses , to give you good vision.
I cannot believe it, here I am looking forward, to get prescribed glasses., so I can see properly again.


The doctor, who did the eye exam, showed me the difference, when I wear glasses, and my vision without glasses.
He mentioned, that high fever can change your vision, but never had heard of a big a change, as I have.
My prescription read O.D -2.75 O.S- 3.00. , and I am sure when you get your glasses, you will be wearing them full time. and I like to see you again, in about 6 months.
Thank goodness for my selfie, and the my mother's help , to find a suitable frame, that I like.


A couple of days later, after I had started to wear the glasses, was so happy with my improved vision, but it took me about a week, before I could wear them all day long, without a head ache.
Now back to my studies, and life, the way, it is now.
Anita, seeing my picture wearing glasses, told me she can't wait to see me, I look great wearing glasses.
I had not heard a word from Tim.
When I phoned him, his mother, she told me that he was now recovering, as he had been sick with the corona virus. and that Tim had told her, it was all my fault, he was sure I had given him the bug.
I asked her, to tell Tim, to give me a call, when he feels better.


About a week later Tim called, and complained to me, of how sick he had been, and that his mother, had looked after him.
Then I told him, about being in the hospital, and that the high fever, had ruined my eye sight, and that I wear glasses now.
Tim told me he was sure, I gave him the bug, and he, does not want to see me anymore, because he does not like girls who wear glasses.
Tim, I can only say one thing, it is all your fault, because we should not have kissed, when you came to see me.
