A partly true story.

             I recommend Seventh Heaven , I am sure you will like it 

Another birthday , and another year older, and when you are 88 years old , you cannot help it 
but you sometimes think about dying.
What is it going to happen after you die ?
Where will I be going , and what will it be like?
I have always wondered , will it be as nice  and wonderful as I have been told all my life?

I had a very enjoyable day , working in my garden and little green house.
After a nice supper . and watching the news and some programs on T.V.
I went to my computer for my nightly routine of enjoying conversations and pictures on Eyescene
and the to Vision and Spex to read some new stories and comments.
Now I was ready to go to bed .
I went to our bedroom , undressed , took off my glasses , and slid under the covers.
Kissed my wife good night , turned over , closed my eyes, and not long after was in DREAMLAND.

The doorbell rang.
I slowly went down the stairs, opened the door, and to my surprise saw there were two beautiful 
angels standing there, both wearing glasses.
They smiled at me and said Nick it is time for you to come with us, we have been told you were a 
pretty good boy and have been send here to take you to heaven.
I was  so surprised that both angels were wearing glasses, 
So I mentioned to them , that I had never seen wearing glasses, do you wear them all the time?
Yes we do , when we go to pick up a person who loves eyeglasses .
You will notice that I wear + lenses, and my partner wears _- lenses , this is to show how beautiful your eyes can look wearing either lens type.
I told them they both looked beautiful.
The angels then asked me to relax , and off we went.
It did not take very long to get to a group of very nice buildings, I was asked to enter one of the smaller buildings.
When I got inside, another beautiful glasses wearing angel, asked me to take a seat.
We are very sorry we did not wait for you to get your glasses, when we picked you up.
Since you have worn glasses for about 68 years, we know you will be more comfortable wearing glasses, here is a new pair of glasses for you.
I put the glasses on, and noticed I had fantastic vision,and the glasses were certainly the best and 
most comfortable glasses I ever wore.
After I sat down , she said sh had to review my good deeds on earth and how I scored.
I could not help it , but had to tall her how beautiful she looked wearing glasses.
She thanked me and told me that in the part of heaven I most likely be going, all the angels wore glasses.
She took my file and started.
You were married for almost 63 years, and was always faithful to your wife.
I notice you had 3 children, and that you and your wife raised them well, they all got married and had families and gave you and your wife 8 grandchildren.
You never got into trouble with the law, and you donated to charities and did volunteer work
With a good record like that , I am quite sure you will be entitled to all the benefits available
of the special part of heaven reserved for the people with a glasses fetish.
We now have to go to see Saint Peter, he makes the final decision.
Then she asked me to come along with her and she would show me the way.
We stopped in front of the most beautiful set of gates I had ever seen, colorful , sparkling and covered with pearls.
My angel knocked and the gate opened.
We entered and there was Saint Peter, he welcomed me to heaven, and remarked he was glad to 
see another soul with the glasses fetish.
He said to the angel , G for glasses is the seventh letter of the alphabet ,so take him to heaven 7 ,
our special section for souls who love glasses.
When we moved along to go to Seventh Heaven , the angel told me about all the different heavens we were passing
On the left was a heaven for girl who liked girls, and on the right a heaven for gay men.
Then there was a heaven for people who loved to shop , another for people who had a fetish for shoes,you name it there was a heaven for everyone so they all could have their enjoyment of choice.
At last to got to section G, Seventh Heaven, the glasses fetish section.
Only in Seventh Heaven could a person admire so many beautiful glasses wearing faces in one place, all art once, what a joyful experience , it was unbelievable.
The place was full of miracles.
In the center was a large optical center , where you could ask for any type of  frame  or lenses that you liked , and the glasses of your choice were ready instantly.
Nobody needed to do glasses over contacts , if you wanted to wear -, 19 .00 lenses , you just asked for the lenses in a frame of your choice , put the glasses on , and you were able to see perfectly 
wearing the stronger prescription.
If you wanted to try + 7.50 lenses , it worked the same way.
You could talk about glasses and lenses  with everybody all day long.
When you met a pretty angel , you could ask her to come to the optical center and model some different frames and lenses for you, they always did it with a smile.
What I found very enjoyable was when they would wear different frames with minus lenses 
and then how the same frames looked with + lenses and show you how nice their eyes looked 
wearing glasses with both type of lenses
The opportunity of looking at all the faces wearing glasses with different frames and lenses was so 
exciting.
What a joy to be in Seventh Heaven. 

On earth I had always been hyperopic and now I had to opportunity to be myopic,
All my life I had been fascinated with myopic lenses, and now I might get my wish and get to wear 
glasses with minus lenses and be myopic.
I went to the optical center and explained to the angel in charge my desire to try myopic lenses.
The angel checked my file and mentioned that I had always had preferred the looks of low myopic lenses, she suggested I most likely be satisfied with a - 3.00 prescription, if I did not like that prescription she would change it to whatever suited me best,
I was all excited, at last I was going to wear glasses for myopia with - 3.00 lenses  so I could find out what it would be like wearing glasses with minus lenses , and how i would look wearing those lenses, something I had always wanted
The angel handed me a very nice frame with the proper lenses .they looked fantastic, I looked at the beautiful  myopic lenses  
, I was all excited.
I carefully was putting the glasses on my face , WHEN ...... I got a real hard shove in the back , woke up and was back on earth.
My wife asked me to settle down and go to sleep, just when I was going to try the fantastic glasses for myopia,
What a rude awakening.
All I can wish for now is , that I will end up min Seventh Heaven.
