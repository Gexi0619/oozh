It was a lovely sunny morning,I had dropped my car off at the local garage for repairs and joined the back of the long que for the bus,people were complaining that the bus was late as usual.When it eventually arrived people started pushing on ,I could see a young girl in a wheelchair start to push herself on to the bus then reverse off other people got on,as I got to the door he said sorry full,you will have to wait for the next bus.
The young girl in the wheelchair was crying,I asked her why she did not stay on the bus,she said there was Already a wheelchair user on and the bus only had a place for one wheelchair,and she would be late for her hospital appointment.as the next bus would be in one hours time.That was also going to be a problem for me,so I told her I was going to ring for a taxi and would she like to accompany me to town and the taxi could drop her off at the hospital,That would me very kind of you sir she said,the only problem is I need to stay in my wheelchair,that's ok I said I will order a taxi that has wheelchair chair access.
We had a nice chat on the way to town about the weather and the busses,she said she normally went on the later bus as it was not as full, but today she had to go to hospital,I did not like to ask her about her appointment or why she was in a wheelchair. She said her Name was June and thanked me as the taxi driver help her out.
The day had not been so busy and I kept thinking about June,and wished I had asked her for her phone number
As I did not have my car I decided to finish early so not to be in the rush hour,I was looking on the destination board to see which bay my bus would go from when I heard a voice behind me say hi Jhon,I turned around and it was June.
She said we need bay 6 but we have a long wait,I alway get here early so I'm at the front of the que.its ok for me she laughed I'm sitting down but you will have to stand in the que,O dear I said why don't we go for a coffee and I will get us a taxi,that's if nobody is waiting for you,That would be very nice she said.
As we sat down opposite each othe It Was the first time I had really had chance to look at her,she had nice shoulder length auburn hair,she was rather pretty except for the rather old fashioned glasses she was wearing,I did not know much about glasses as I had never dated a girl with glasses but the lens did seem rather thick.
I asked her how her day had been,hoping I would find out why she had been to hospital and why she was in a wheelchair,Not good she said my appointment was cancelled at the last moment as the doctor rang in to say he had a family problem and would not be in today.then when I got to work I had to ask my boss for time off  on Wednesday as well.
How was your day she said I noticed you come out of the office next to mine she said,,o it was ok not so busy,I was thinking of you actually and wishing I had asked for your phone number ,O why was that .did you want to ask me why I 
Was going to the hospital and why was in a wheelchair and was I disabled.most people just ignored me she said.
I'm sure I went rather red.well I stammered I did wonder but it would have been rude to ask, but I had enjoyed our time on the taxi ride and thought it would be nice to chat again.June then went rather red herself, Sorry she said that was very rude of me 
I had a eye appointment at the hospital,I'm sure you noticed my rather thick glasses,I am very long sighted and have a retina problem,she then wheeled herself around to my side and lifted the blanket off her legs and said as you can see I am a amputee I only have one leg I had a car accident 6 months ago and had to have my right leg amputated high above the knee so I only have a little stump.
Its ok if you want to leave I can get the next bus home.
Why would I want to do that I said well most of my so called friend did after my accident.
Well when I meet you I liked you as a person you being in a wheelchair makes no difference and I have never had a girlfriend that has worn glasses,so it would be a nice change,
O are you expecting me to be your girlfriend then June laughed.thats a bit soon.
Well a friend then and you are a girl hahs I said.June gave a big smile ok that's true.
Shall we go for a meal now I don't feel like cooking tonight and it be nice to have your company.there is a nice Italian restaurant just around the corner.yes please that would be very nice June said.
Hello Jhon how are you the reception said I'm fine thank can we have a nice table in the garden please is there a way my friend can get her wheelchair out there,yes of course if you follow me you can come around this staff way,shall I push you June,yes please if you don't mind, will you help me out of my chair in the seat please.just hold my arm I can hop into the chair.
The head waiter brought the menu for us,would you like to order drinks first.yes please,what would you like June. A orange joice please if that's ok.I will leave you the menu let me know when you are ready to order.
June seemed to be having a problem reading the menu,can you manage ok I said.
I think I need to put my reading glasses on,do you mind Jhon.course not why do you think I would.My friends used to call me the old lady when I need to put my reading glasses on.well I not think they are it nice friends if they say that.
Please put them on and let's see u smiling. Are you sure Jhon they only  blue NHS frames.they look fine dear you got blue eyeshadow on and a blue dress they match nice dear.O Jhon you so kind or a good fib teller haha.I actually like them better on you than the brown glasses you have for distance. if you don't mind I will keep them on I can see if there are any fish bones ha
We had a great meal chatting and laughing after we had had coffee I asked the waiter to order us a taxi suitable for June's wheelchair,
Can you lift me into my wheelchair please Jhon, It has been a very stressful day and it's hard to balance on one leg.as I lifted her I could feel the end of her stump.I could see her looking at me to see how I reacted, I just smiled at her and said hope that was ok.
When we reached her apartment I paid the taxi driver and pushed June to her apartment door,can you manage ok now I said,yes thank you Jhon I have had a wonderful evening and you are such a gentleman.I will order a taxi for us in the morning what time is best for you,that's if you not mind my company.
9am would be best if that's ok with you Jhon. Ok night night I said.
Don’t I get a good night kiss was June's reply or you not like me with these brown glasses on,she opened her bag and took out her blue reading glasses and put them on her eyes look so Hugh and beautiful now.I bend over to give her a kiss on her check as I did she put her arms around my head an pulled me towards her lips and gave me a big kiss, night night thanks she said.

When I rang the doorbell next morning I had to wait a few minutes until June opened the door for me ,smiling she said good morning Jhon sorry I'm a bit late,,I overslept haha.I have had a phone call the eye doctor wants to see me 2pm today.I wish it was later in the day and then I could asked you to come with me.If you want me to come just ask Me,then I will arrange to have a half day.Im not used to being disabled and needing help she said.you are not disabled dear I said u just a little less able to do some things.

I arranged a taxi for 1pm and picked June up at 1 15 so we arrived at the hospital with plenty of time, we were called into a small room the nurse did a lot of tests then she took us into the doctors, the doctor looked at his computer screen then instructed June to sit in front of this machine, after a few minutes he turn to us and said I Am going to admit you straight away June there is a tear in your right retina, if we do not repair it straight away then you will loose your sight in that eyeI. all should be done by 7pm your can come and collect your girlfriend the doctor said,I saw June smile.
I arrived back at 7pm June was sitting in her wheelchair waiting for me she had a large bandage over her right eye,I asked the nurse how the operation went,she said its to early to tell you must bring  June back in 2 days for the doctor to check,she said ,also she must not do any bending or working and must not be on her own tonight.
June smiled when I got close to her,it was the first time I had seen her without glasses,her left  eye looked very small,how are you I said,I'm a bit sleepy and can't see much without my glasses,I must look like a pirate with one one eye and one leg,Well you are a beautiful pirate.
When we got to June's apartment,I told her what the nurse had said,yes the doctor told me that as well,I'm very tired Jhon could you carry me into my bedroom,or maybe I should go to the bathroom first.there were handrails beside the toilet, call me when you are finished I said you are not to hop, ready she said.I carried her to the wash basin a held her while she washed her face and hands,ok all done she said can you carry me into the bedroom,can you manage now I said, yes thank you I'm sure you not want to see my ugly stump.nobody has seen it I'm so ashamed with it.I think you should let me decide if I think it's ugly,if we are going to see each other more,ok June said can you help me get this long skirt off.I could feel June shaking, her stump was very short only about 6ins long and heavy scars, it did not upset me as it was not important as I liked June a lot,I could see a jar of cream,so I opened the jar I put my hand on her stump rubbing in the cream on her scar.I could see tears in her left eye,don't cry I said you might damage your right eye.you had better sleep now,I will sleep on the settee.
I woke first made a cup of tea and toast for us and knocked on June's door, come in  Jhon you not need to knock.did you sleep well I said.O Yes it was so nice of you to put cream on my stump,I still find it hard to touch it myself,but you did not seem to mind thank you.
Do you .have you an old pair of glasses I realise you can't see much without glasses.yes my old ones are in the top drawer in the tall chest over there.
Is it ok if I take the right arm off we can put a strap around the back to hold them on.
I have taken the rest of the week off so I can look after you.
That's so kind Jhon I never meet a man that wants to look after me before.do u want me to run you a bath rather than stand in the shower and get eye bandage wet.then I thought we go into the park and have lunch there
It's very hot today what are you going to wear dear,have you any shorts,
I'm ready Jhon can you bring my chair please,you look very nice dear try these glasses on I have put a elastic strap around the back.o that's better thank you Jhon at least I can see a little now.have you got my leg blanket please.
I'm sure it's to hot for that today I said.
but people will see I got only one leg,so what dear if I not mind,then forget others dear.
Are you really sure you not mind being seen with me like this Jhon.of course not dear.
This is lovely Jhon I have not been here since I had my leg amputated.
Would you like fish and chips Andre can sit over there by the lake,yes of Course.
Shall I lift you out of your chair.Yesss please can you push the wheelchair out of the way while we eat dear,I don't feel disabled when I'm with you Jhon.
Even before I had my leg amputated I felt disabled because of my poor eye sight Have you been offered a prosthetic leg dear, I hope you don't mind me asking you dear,
The problem they say is that I only have a little stump left and any leg would be heavy 
Maybe we could see if we could buy you a lightweight peg leg dear.

If The taxi drops us off here dear we can make our own way to the hospital thought the gardens it be more restful,I know you stressed.

Number 21 next please,that's us dear,the nurse dims the light and take June's bandages off,put your head on the rest please I need to take some photos for the doctor
Good morning June let's see how we did with the repair the doctor says,
Ok can you manage to get over to this low vision chart and let's check what you can see, he puts the test glasses on June, I could see him looking at the printout from one one the machines the nurse had given him first he blacks out June's left eye then add some lens in the right side.
Can you tell me which way any of the Es go June,no doctor I can just make out some blurred shapes .OK he hold a lens In front of the test glasses, is one or two better 2,three or four 4 he keeps adding different lens the same questions again and again.then asked red or green after more adjustments,which side of the bar is the red dot.I can't see a red dot June replies.more lens are added.ok after about 15 mins he says I think that's the best we can do for now with that eye.he changes the black lens to the other eye.and repeats it all then he hands  June a card Can you read any of the lines on this card June,not really ok he adds more lens and asks the same questions 
All done for today,well at least we have managed to save your sight in the right eye,the vision is a down a lot  and your astigmatism is much worse and I have had to add a lot of prisms. The nurse will take some more pictures next week for me to look at then after 3 months we will check the vision again and see if we can get you to see further down the card.I will print out your. new prescription for you to take to any glasses shop to get your glasses it will be faster than waiting for us to make them.the glasses and the lens will be free on the NHS for you.your old distance glasses will be useless now but your reading glasses might be a little help for seeing a little.
He hands June the papers,let's have a coffee.in the garden dear while you rest I think that was hard for you.
That's nice coffee Jhon,I asked for double strength ha.can you read what's on the papers he given me, I can't see anything.This one is your next appointment card,this is the NHS vouchers for 3 pairs of glasses why 3 pairs June asks, I'm not sure but let's look at the prescription card,o I see you need a distance pair a computer pair and a reading pair.are my eyes that bad now June asks.I looked at the details it read.
Distance R +28  5.25 180 Prisim out 12.  L+ 14. 2.25. 120  Prisim out 6 
Middle.    R+30.  5.25 180 Prisim out 14.  L +16 2.25   120. Prisim out 8
Reading. R +34. 5.25. 180 Prisim out 16. L +18 2.25. 120   Prisim out 10
Don't worry dear the good thing is you will be able to see better

When we get to the shop the assistant looks at the papers and says can you wait I will get the manager to look at your prescription.
Good morning madam I'm sorry but we will have to order these lens for you,they are not in our stock range.
That's ok I said we understand that.The NHS will only pay for C39 lens they will be rather thick I'm afraid but if you want to pay for the extra thinner lens then the price will be about £200 for each pair so that's £600.
I can't afford that Jhon please don't leave me. They are going to look dreadful on me. It's ok dear it's not worth paying all that when the doctor wants to test you again in 3 months maybe them your outside glasses we get in thinner lens.
Wait I will ring the wholesaler.to see how long it will take to get the lens.my assistant will show you what colours NHS frames we have in stock in your size.
Not brown June says I know my boyfriend not like brown ha I think u need 3 different colours then it easy for you to tell the difference.You cloose Jhon your the one that has to look at me,just surprise me.
The manager returns I have  a little good news for you,they have the blanks in stock for your distance prescription and your reading prescription but they will have to order your computer lens.they are sending the 2 lens they have in stock by currier they will be here in about 2 hours so I will try to get one pair ready before we close.
Can we go to the park near the river while we wait Jhon and have fish and chips again haha,yes of course dear.do you want a double coffee capacino.Yes please.
Shall we go shopping as well dear it might help you relax let's look for some more cloth for you don't try to hide yourself,I love you as an Amputee, so I want you to accept that your self dear.ok Jhon if you help me then I can.
That's the cloth sorted,let's go to the makeup department see if any are doing free makeovers ha wow very nice dear,love the pink eye makeup,
I think it's time we got you out of that wheelchair sometimes,let's go to that equipment shop and see if we can get you some bright coloured crutches and nice coloured stump socks.
You can have either shoulder crutches or arm crutches madam,I don't know I have never used either before. 
Ok let's have a pair of each one pair in pink and the other in blue.If I bought the pink wheelchair for June would you give me a discount  on all three items and send this old black one back to the hospital.Ooo Jhon you can't spend all that money on me.why not I'm single so I have savings
That's sooo much more comfortable.and I love the colour,it makes me feel very different.we had better go and see if your new glasses are ready yet,can we collect the crutches later on our way home.
That was good timing Ms the work room has just brought your glasses up I will get the manager for you,I looked on the tray they had done both pairs for June.I could see which were June's reading glasses they were even thicker  than the pink distance ones I had chosen
We managed to do both pair for you the manager said.the problem we have is the thickness of the right lens we can't close the arm enough to put them in normal  cases.but let's try them on you and see how they fit and what you can see,I'm sure they will be a great help they are much stronger that what u have now,
The right lens was about double the thickness of the left lens and well over one inch thick with lots of Prism rings and very bulged in the front at the middle.
June looked ahead oooooo John I really can see so many things.thats good let's try your reading glasses he lifted the transparent frames from the tray.
you will find these rather heavy I'm afraid,can you read anything on this card Yess I can read 4 lines.can I look at my distance glasses I want to see what colour you choose I think I can guess as you bought me a pink wheelchair and asked the lady to put pink eye makeup on me haha.Oooo Jhon the right lens is so very thick are you sure you want to be seen with me,stop being a silly girl,I would not have bought all these things for you if I not want to be with you.put them back on now dear and look at your reading glasses,ooo they are different not seen that colour before .
I'm pleased the bus driver not let me on the other day we would not have met haha that's true i said,you lost your leg and found true love,you say such nice things Jhon.
The lens for your computer glasses will be here in about a weeks time,we will ring you when they are ready for you to collect.
 Shall I cook a meal for us tonight June said,yes please that would be nice I must do some paperwork when I get home,shall I come round about 8pm,yes that would be perfect.
I rang the doorbell and June opened the door,wow you look great how is your arm crutch,it's difficult but I will try to get used to it I love the pink colour haha and it's not as tiring as hopping.
Will you carry the hot dishes in Jhon,it's difficult with crutches,but it's nice to stand up,can you open the Pesco,do you mind if I try wearing my reading glasses,they are in my bag over there,can you put them on for me please,
They look very nice on your dear,I like the transparent colour,everything in the distance is a brur but close is very good.thank you for everything and making me so happy,let's eat now cheers.
That was a lovely meal thank you,go and sit down I will clear the dishes,shall we finish the wine before I go dear,
Do you have to go Jhon, I'm scared to be on my own now I'm nearly blind,without my glasses on.
Or don't you want to share a bed with a blind, amputee.

When I woke June was screwing her eyes up to try and see my face both her pupils were totally lost in the corners.of her eyes,I reached to the bedside table and picked up her reading glasses and placed them on her nose. That's so much better Jhon I hate feeling blind and useless,
How would you feel if we bought you a pair of children's rubber glasses with straps around the back or swimming goggles to sleep in dear.
Won't it be even more of a turnoff for you it's bad enough me having ugly scars on my little stump
Your stump is not a turnoff and I want you to enjoy being in bed with me so you need to see dear. 
Are you ready dear I have hired a car for today,so we can put your wheelchair in and you can sit in the front with me I thought we would go and eat before we order glasses for you to wear in bed.

Do you want a beer with the fish and chips today dear,I have never had a beer,but yes please.Is it ok if I put my reading glasses on its so much easier to see to eat with them on .that was very nice Jhon I liked the beer with the fish and chips 
Do we have time to go to the park before we go to the eye doctor,I had better put my other glasses back on now.
What are you looking at June ,everything dear I can't believe how well I can see in these glasses I don't remember seeing like this since I was a child.
Are you really sure you don't mind being with me wearing these glasses I know they are so thick,but they are really such a help.I think you must be deaf as well dears  maybe we get you hearing aids as well ha, I keep telling you that you look fine xx hug.
I never knew how many girls smoked,maybe it was because I could not see as  well before,do you smoke Jhon.
Sometimes but not often I said.
I have never tried but often wondered what it was like,but I was to nervous to June said.
Do you want to try dear,they sell them in the shop over there,June looks down and covers her mouth and nervously says yes please can I try.
I have bought you menthol cigarettes dear,they are not so strong and have a cooling taste.do you know what to do dear.No haha.ok just put in in your mouth and hold it with your lips first,just get used to it then  take it out holding it between two fingers,get used to doing that a few times before I light it.
Ok that's the way now just suck in a little,ok when I light it that's what you do.I hope nobody that knows me is looking Jhon.
Remember to just suck slow then blow the smoke out.Cough cough couch I said suck in a little and slow haha not a Huge suck xxx.try again just a little and slow and let's the smoke drift out of your mouth,that's better now again.cough,you getting good now dear. I like the taste Jhon is very strong menthol and very cool to my throat.haha you inhaled it as well.shall I smoke it all,yes if you want to.
It's good I'm in my wheelchair jhon I feel very lightheaded and a bit dizzy haha I feel like a noughty school girl haha.
Its the beer and the cigarette you not used to either haha.  

Shall we go to the glasses shop and ask about glasses for bed time dear then come back here and have a coffee and cakes,Yes please Jhon.
Hello June and Jhon the lens arrived lunchtime today for your middle distance glasses,but we not fitted them in the frames yet.
We wanted to ask you something,June is terrified of waking up in the night and feeling blind without her  glasses on could you fit the lens either into children's rubber frames or swimming goggle so she could sleep with them on.
Yes I'm sure we have a pair of purple rubber frames in.If you can come back in about one hour I will get them done for you.that's great thanks.
Can we go back and have the coffee and cakes please Jhon,yes of course dear.the cakes are lovely Jhon,I could never afford to buy them.
I  think I would like to try another cigarette if that's ok,I was just getting used to smoking without coughing haha,will you light it for me please,cough cough,o I think I inhaled it to fast,I like the taste of the menthol Jhon I feel so happy and relaxed June takes a long slow drag on her cigarette,they don't smell nasty like some cigarette I seen people smoking it's nice with the coffee as well.
I think I have falling in love with you I have never felt like this before,nobody has ever treated me like this I feel so different now,I don't mind what people say or think about my glasses or my leg,or lack of a leg haha ,and if my so called friends see me smoking 
June puts her cigarette back in the corner of her mouth holding it only with her lips and starts pushing her wheelchair, she stops.jhon that girl over there used to be my best friend,but I have not seen her for a long time.
Can you make sure I look ok I want to surprise her,can you fold my shorts up a little please so my stump shows and undo the top button of my blouse,can I have a fresh cigarette,she smokes and always teased me because I not smoke can you light it please and push me over to that seat.
Hello Susan how are you,June takes a long drag on her cigarette and blows smoke towards Susan haha,Ooo June how are you not seen you for a while.Im fine thanks this is my boyfriend Jhon
June put her cigarette in the corner of her mouth and hops onto the bench next to Susan,taking a long drag on her cigarette before taking it out of her mouth and exhaled the smoke out of her nose.
You look very different June now.
O you mean I got even thicker lens in my glasses and I'm not hiding my stump.Jhon like playing.with my stump so I don't hide it 
I'm hoping to get a peg leg fitted next month.
That will be nice for you June, I did not know you smoked,O Jhon taught me I smoke about 10 a day I like the taste and I feel relaxed.
We better go now will you lift me back into my new wheelchair dear

Thank you so much Jhon for keeping silent while I told all those porky,s,but she used treat me so nastily about my glasses and always refusing a cigarette. then when I had my accident she would just cross the road to avoid me and I was to shy to say anything,but you have given me so much confidence
