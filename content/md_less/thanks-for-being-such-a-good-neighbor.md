That's what happens, when you have a good neighbor.

Peace and quit, after seeing 3 children off to school, to catch the school bus, on time, now it is my time to relax
I sat down, to enjoy, with a cup of coffee, and read the local paper.


In a couple of weeks is the start, of spring break, and we are planning, to do some outdoor activities. 
None of the children, have spend enough time outdoors lately, and I am a believer, of a lot of fresh air, and sunshine.
Let me tell you, about our family, my husband Jim, and I, Alexandria,{ Alex},
married 16 years ago, and are the proud parents, of Kathy, 14, Amy 12, and our son Edward, who is 10 .


We know, Kathy, has lately starting to look at boys, and she old me to day, that Brandon, who she really likes, is now wearing glasses, and loves, the way he now looks, he looks so nice, and intelligent, and that she had never realized before, that wearing glasses, can make a person look so attractive.
Well, Kathy, look at your dad, I think, he looks very handsome wearing glasses.


All of us, like the outdoors, playing ball, camping, playing soccer, and swimming, and in the winter, we love to cross country ski. 
Last fall, was rainy and cold, and we never had a nice snowfall, to really go cross country skiing, so we never, had a chance, to spend to much time, enjoying the outdoors. 
Now, I am looking forward to spring, so we can go outside, and get some fresh air and sunshine.


My neighbor, Christine came over, for a coffee to day, and we always have lots to talk about, because our children, are all about the same age.
She was telling me to day, that after their last eye exam, her oldest daughter, Joanne, had to get new glasses, because her prescription, has increased, and that her sister Kim, now wears glasses, because, she is also myopic.
The optometrist had told her, that now, it is very common, for children to be myopic at a younger age, because of the way, they use their eyes, for a lot of close work, instead of distance viewing, like people, in the olden days, who needed good vision to go hunting. 
Children, should spend more time outside in the sunshine, like they used to do.
To day's conversation, gave me something to think about, that because of the bad weather, we sure did not spend to much time outdoors lately.
Because, all of the children have been so healthy, and never complain, about headaches, or their vision, they have not had an eye exam lately, that made me realize, that their last eye exam, was more then 2 years ago.
I made appointments, for all three, to have their eyes examined, during spring break, which starts in a few weeks.


That night, Katie told me all, about Joanne's new glasses , and how nice she now looks, and that Joanne, let her try her new glasses, but I could not see very well wearing the glasses, but when, I tried Kim's new glasses, I could see everything, so nice and clear, I really liked that, do you think, I need to wear glasses?
I have made an appointment, for eye exams, for all of you, during spring break., and then, we will find out. 


The next time, Christine came over, I told her, about Katie trying Joanne's, and Kim's glasses, and that she could see everything, nice and clear, wearing Kim's glasses, and after hearing that, have made appointments for eye exams.
Well, Alex, it sounds to me, that she might be myopic, and has to wear glasses.
When, children try some friend's glasses, is how they, usually find out, that they to, should be wearing glasses.
That is, how I found out, I needed to wear glasses, I tried my best friends new glasses, when she started to wear them, and I have worn glasses ever since.
Katie, is most likely, myopic, like my girls, and she will be able to see perfect again, after she starts to wear glasses.


It is almost time for spring break, and we have made some plans, to have an enjoyable time, with some outings, and of course our eye exams.


All our plans, SURE changed, when, all the schools, and businesses were closed, because of the Corona Virus.
Now, all we can do now, is stay home, like they ask us to do.


After a couple of weeks, I started to hear more, and more complaints, they cannot go and play, with their friends, and having to stay indoors, all the time.
My husband, who is a paramedic, is still working, and I have all the fun.
We have played, all kinds of games, and I have had all of them, help me doing the house work. 
We were just informed, that the teachers, will now be teaching on line, every morning, so all of them, will now be busy with heir lessons.
I have noticed that lately, Katie, seemed to be looking very close, to whatever she does, like reading a book, and using her tablet, which I know, is not a good sign, but our eye exams are on hold, and I am sure, Katie should be wearing glasses,.she sure shows all the signs, of being myopic.


When, a couple of days later, I was talking on the phone, with Christine, I told her about Katie,] her face being so close, to what ever she is doing, now I am sure, she needs to wear glasses, and I have noticed, that Amy also, is with her nose in the book, when she is reading.
Alex, it sounds, both of your girls, need to wear glasses.
I know, but our eye exams are on hold, till everything, returns to normal, and nobody knows, when that will be
Yes, that is a real problem.
Because of Katie's suspected, vision problem, I have been looking up, some information, on the internet, about vision and glasses, and now, have some idea, when a person, needs to wear glasses, and how to do a simple eye test, to find out, if they do need to wear glasses.
I gave all of them the eye test, and Katie, will need to wear glasses, and I am almost sure, that Amy also needs to wear glasses. 


The next time, I talked to Christine, I told her about, about what I had learned on the internet, and that I had given the girls, a simple eye test, and now am sure, Katie needs to wear glasses, and that Amy, is ready for glasses . 
I wish, we could have had, that eye exam, and have the girls looked after, so they could have their glasses.


A couple of days later, Christine phoned me, Alex, I think, I might be able to help you, with Katie's, and Amy's vision problems.
As you know, Joanne, just started to wear new glasses, I still have, her first, and second pair, and I have checked their prescriptions, they show only a small amount of astigmatism, and in my opinion, the glasses, are safe for them to wear. 
If you would like to try the glasses, I will, put them in your mail box.
Let, Katie try the glasses first, and try both pair of glasses to see, which pair will improve her vision, and if they do, she can wear them, till she has her eye exam, and get her own glasses.
Christine, thank you, that sounds great, I will have the girls, try the glasses.
I, certainly will give that a try, it might look after their vision problem, for the time being. 
A short time later, Edward told us, that Mrs. Jones, put something in our mail box,.
Yes Edward, that is for me, would you get it please.
Edward went out, and came back quickly, and handed me an envelope, with the glasses in it.
I looked at the glasses, that Christine had marked 1 and 2.


I called Katie and Amy, and handed Katie, the number two pair, and after Katie had put them on, asked her, to look out of the window, and around the room.
Next,, I asked to wear, the weaker pair, and as soon as she put them, on and looked around, said, mom, I can see much better with the first pair.
Then I asked Amy, to try the glasses, when she put the glasses on, said mom, these glasses are great, I can see everything, so nice and clear, can I wear them all the time? 
Yes, you both can wear the glasses, and we will get you, your own, after the eye exam.
Both of them are so happy, with their improved vision, and even, like the way they look, and are wearing the glasses all day.


I phoned, Christine, to thank her, and tell her, how happy they both are, wearing the glasses, and their improved vision.
Alex, the glasses that Amy is wearing, both lenses are - 0.75. , the glasses, Katie is wearing, are - 1.25., now you know, you have 2 myopic girls.
Christine, thank you for being, such a good neighbor, both girls love wearing the glasses, and being able to see everything, so nice and clear, thank you.


Both girls are so happy to have the glasses, they like wearing their glasses.
Today, I noticed, that both girls, are looking at all the eyeglass frames,
available on line, and with their picture on the screen, are trying to find , the perfect frame to wear, after they have the eye exam.
Thank goodness, that really keeps them busy.
I am so glad, we have a good neighbor.!!1
