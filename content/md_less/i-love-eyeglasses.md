Ever since I was a little boy ,I have been facinated with eyeglasses. Nobody in our family needed them. my grand parents
wore them and one uncle.It did not matter or a boy or a girl wore them I  envied them .
My mother got reading glasses, but only wore them at night. She kept them in the dining room buffet drawer. I loved to
 take them ,run to my room and look at myself.
I never had any other opportunities to try glasses. After finishing college  I only had eyes for girls who wore glasses.
Then I started to have some headaches and the lady where I boarded suggested I get my eyes checked, so I did and I was
told That Glasses would help me. So I became the proud wearer of glasses. When my girlfriend saw them she loved them,
and she wanted glasses just like mine. When my mother saw me wearing glasses, all she could say was I always thought you 
needed glasses.I have been a proud wearer of glasses for more than 60 years, and I still love them and like nothing better than
to go to the optical store ,get an eye exam and look at new glasses.I always notice any girl with glasses and enjoy looking
at them.
