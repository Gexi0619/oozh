Flea markets are a guilty pleasure of mine. The whole needle in the haystack thrill of the hunt is enough to compel me to drive far and wide to check out the vendor's wares and find that unexpected piece to complete this room or that. I attended a major flea market in western Connecticut on Sunday and, while the pickings were rather pedestrian, it was a treasure trove for the optically obsessed! I don't know if it was due to the early hour, or the casual nature of the event, but it was a day for glasses watching unlike any other!!! Beautiful and wealthy men and women in designer glasses of all shapes and sizes!! From the barely myopic to the completely dependant it was all I could do to not stay all day!! During my browsings one girl in particular caught my gaze. Mid-20s blonde and sporting a pair of oversized Prada frames which housed lenses of at least minus 8. Without trying to be too obvious I naturally followed her at a distance and then the fantasy became reality! As it got sunnier she reached into her straw shopping tote and fumbled for a glasses case. She then removed her glasses and handed them to her shopping companion leaving her squinting hopelessly bare eyed into her now foggy view. She quickly popped open the case and removed a pair of classic ray ban sunglasses and I was off! In the interim her friend had tried on her regular glasses and commented on how blind she must be and I was off!!! Almost had to avail myself of a port a pottie to take care of the intensity now brewing down below!!! Her vision now restored to her she moved on and I contented myself to continue my glasses watching in the vast expanse of the market. I am normally of the hyperopic persuasion, but this encounter may have encouraged me to expand my focus!!! Just goes to show ya! You never know what you'll find at a flea market!! Go for a credenza. Leave with a hard on
