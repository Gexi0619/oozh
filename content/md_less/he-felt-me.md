I know I’m gonna sound like an idiot saying this, but my pandemic time was FANTASTIC! I loved owning my time and even working in my house became such an easy thing to do. I could sleep more, enjoy my meals, and to me it felt amazing. I know a lot of people lost someone and that’s why I feel bad for saying this. 

To the company I work for became way easier to have us doing home office and they decided to stick to it. I was so happy with this decision, until I realized I had stopped living my social life. I didn’t go out anymore, not even to the market or the mall, I could buy anything I needed and wanted online and I could have it almost immediately in my hands. One day I thought to myself that it was a good idea to go out to a local pub and see if I could maybe meet a guy, I felt very lonely by now and I’ve always been a pretty girl so I thought I wouldn’t have any trouble into getting someone to come home with me tonight. 

Boy, was I wrong. As soon as I arrived at the pub I started to feel super anxious, no one was wearing their masks, how would I know if someone was taking care of them or not? I didn’t even finished the beer I ordered and I ran out of there. 

That got me thinking I wouldn’t be able to date anymore, how was I supposed to date if I couldn’t go out to public places? And then it hit me… I could get anything I wanted on internet, maybe I could meet someone as well. 

I looked up information about which apps where for what and I went with tinder… Pretty much all are the same. 

I downloaded the app, filled my profile with my information and then I was ready to start looking for potential dates. Guys from all kinds started appearing there, and since I’ve never been a shallow girl, I was more interested in their bio and profile. 

I remember the minute I read his “a little about me” space. It read “I used to be a very outgoing guy, but since we’ve been in quarantine I don’t know how to be anymore”. I thought “well, at least we have one thing in common for sure”, so I decided to sweep right. 

A few hours went by and I had already forgotten about the app when a notification in my cellphone reminded me about it “You have a new match” it read. 

I already had a message from him and to make a long story short, I’ll let you take a look into it: 

-“Olá linda, meu nome é Bastiam Barbosa”

WHAT? A Portuguese guy??? I knew very Little Portuguese but I knew he spoke English as well, his bio was written in English. 

- “Olá, meu nome é Nicole. Voce fala Ingles?”
- “Yes, a little bit” he texted

YES! He did, and to be honest his pictures were FINE. He had dark messy, not so long but not so short hair, big brown eyes, he had bronzed skin and a smile you only see on dental floss adds. 


- “Nice, I can kinda understand Portuguese but I don’t know that much” I said
- “If you want, I’ll teach you a little bit” 
- “That’d be great” I texted back
- “Ok Nicole, tell me about yourself”
-“Well, I’m 29 years old, I work as an analyst for statistical data, I like rock music and I love sports”
- “Wow, sounds interesting, I’m bad at math and I only go to the gym but I’ve never done sports” he said
- “Well, if you want me to I’ll trade those Portuguese lessons for math classes” 
- “We have a deal then. Can I have your phone number”

And of course I gave it to him, he was gorgeous and it was very interesting talking with a foreigner.
He texted me almost immediately and the conversation went on for hours. He told me he is not Portuguese but Brazilian and he came to the US to work but he had to leave when the pandemic started so currently he was in Brazil but was having a hard time coming again cause he was very attached to his family. 

Weeks went by and we kept texting each other, he liked to call me at night and his accent made it better. I was kinda falling in love but how? How can you fall for someone who’s so far and you’ve never met?

My company decided it was time for us to go back to the office, they’ve been getting complaints of other employees about wasting their resources so the amazing home office era ended officially. I went to work feeling bad, I wasn’t happy there anymore and I called Bastiam as soon as I got out.

“Olá meu amor, how is your day going?” he asked me
-“Ahhh I never want to come back to those offices, I feel so anxious being here with everyone”
-“I’m sorry to hear that, are you going back to home office sometime?”
-“I don’t think so” I said “I even feel like quitting, after all I hate this job” 
-“And why don’t you? Quit and come to visit me, maybe you’ll like it here”

Oh my god, I’ve been wanting hard for him to say he’s coming, but knowing now he wants me to go opened a whole world for me. I thought about it for a few hours and said WHAT THE HECK? I’m doing it!
Thankfully the company gave me a good amount of money and said I could go back anytime I wanted. 

He lived in a city called “Natal” and I wanted to surprise him so I kept it a secret until I had everything ready.
-“Meu belo homem, I’ve got a surprise for you”
-“Minha menina linda what is it?”
-“I’m going to meet you the day after tomorrow!”
-“What?! What do you mean?”
-“Yes, I finally got the courage to quit and I’m going to Natal to meet you. Aren’t you happy about it?”
-“Of course I am Nicole, I’m just a little bit afraid”
-“Afraid? I promise I’m not gonna kidnap you or anything”
-“No, I’m afraid you wont like me” he said
-“Wait, have you been catfishing me?”
-“No no, but you haven’t seen the real Bastiam. I never mentioned that I have a disability, I know I should’ve but I was getting along with you so good that it went off my mind” he said
-“What kind of disability? Do you think I care if you have a disability? You’re still the guy I talk to when I go to sleep, the one who makes my days better with his texts… I don’t care Bastiam, if you don’t want me to go I won’t, but I really want to meet you” I answered
-“I do want you to come, but you have to promise me you won’t stick around out of pitty, you’ll be honest if you don’t like me”
-“I swear honey, I do”
-“Ok, can you please share with me your flight information, I’ll go to pick you up at the airport.”
I wish I knew him better cause he sounded kinda exited but afraid and I didn’t know where I was standing at this point. I mean, what does “having a disability” mean? Doesn’t he have legs? Is he paralyzed? Does he have issues with his little guy standing still? Whatever it is you’ll know when you see him.

I had everything ready to go so I took a second look and I thought everything was ready until I got to the airport and I realized my reading glasses were missing. Reading has become a real challenge without them, I could maybe read or browse through social media for 2 minutes before getting headaches and seeing the worlds melt into one. I could not longer see small print, maybe if there was good light I could, but forget about dim light reading without them was impossible. Thank god I found a souvenir shop at the airport and they had generic reading glasses, I tried a few and realized I could see with the +1.50 good, but the +2.00 made it easier, I could even read with the +3.50 but things were blurry in the distance. I bought a +2.00, +2.50 and +3.50 cause you never know. 
My flight was gonna be a long one, almost 15 hours but I was willing to it and more for my man. 


I took out my book and tried the different glasses, all of them worked fine but the +3.50 ones made the letters so big I decided to used them. After a few hours I fell asleep and I was woken up by a flight attending who gave me a pack of peanuts, coffe, a sandwich and orange juice. I knew I still had a few hours there so I enjoyed the flight, a few hours more passed and I decided to read a little bit more but some pages later I felt sleepy and I didn’t realize when but I fell asleep. 

I woke up when a lady said “hey you need to put the table in again, we’re landing in a few minutes”. I thanked her and of course got ready for landing, never did my mind registered I was wearing my reading glasses until I wanted to see the flight attendant, of course I took them off.

The landing was smooth and I was finally a few minutes away from Bastiam.
I got off the plane, picked my luggage and went through the door. 

“WELCOME NICOLE WAY” read a sign, and there he was my perfect Brazilian guy standing still with a bunch of flowers in one hand and the sign in the other. 

I ran and hugged him hard, I couldn’t even wait so I kissed them like I’ve never kissed someone before.

-“Ben-vinda meu amor” said Bastiam with his deep manly voice
-“Hi baby, I’ve been dying to kiss you” 
He took my bags and lead me to the parking lot, there was his cousin Joao waiting for us, he greeted me in words I don’t know and gave me a hug. I felt so welcome.


Joao drove us to Bastiam house and we were finally alone, I went to the bathroom to refresh a little bit, I brushed my teeth and went out. Bastiam was sitting in his living room, looking amazingly good and all I could do was kiss him, I sat down on top of him, and kissed him for what it felt like a second but was probably and hour. Then things turned a little hotter, I could feel his pants getting harder and harder as the kiss went on, his hands were on my waist and back doing movements that made me feel protected, like I was safe there. I knew he wasn’t gonna take the next step but I was ready to so my kisses started going down to his neck, and I took his shirt off. I whispered “Do you want to” to his ear and he responded with the hardest passionate kiss I’ve ever had. I took my own blouse off and he then caressed my breast, they fitted perfectly to his big manly hands. He undid my bra and threw it god knows where. Things got a lot more interesting and we did everything you can imagine. I’ve never done it for so long but he couldn’t stop, he was amazing. It was magical. 
I laid down on his chest, we were still naked and he kissed my head several times, this was such a sweet gesture. 

-“Nicole, I really need to talk to you” he said
-“Is everything ok? What’s wrong?” I answered a little worried at his tone
-“I need you to know the real Bastiam”
-“What do you mean baby? What’s going on? Tell me please”
He took a deep breath and said –“I have severe eye issues”
-“What? Is that it?” That’s not what I was specting at all but to me it sounded something simple
-“I don’t think you understand Nicole, like severe severe”
-“No babe, I don’t understand. Can you explain me please?
-“I’ve got severe myopia, astigmatism and things have gone to a point where even glasses or contacts won’t fully correct my sight” he said
-“Well, how bad is it? I wear reading glasses too”
-“I have a pair of reading glasses to switch with my distance ones as well, but I need to wear glasses or contacts ALL the time. By all the time I mean I can’t see anything without them” he said
-“So youre wearing contacts now?” I asked
-“Yes, I am. But the bad thing about me wearing contacts is that I can only stand them a few hours a day. I’ve felt they were killing me for the past hour. That’s why I kept my eyes closed”
-“Ohh, I don’t want you to be in pain Bast, please take them out. I swear I don’t care that you wear glases. I do too and they’re amazing”
-“Wait until you see me to say that” He said, then he got up and went to the bathroom.
 
10 minutes passed and he came back bareyed
-“Where are your glasses baby? You said you need them all the time”
-“I’ve got them here in my hand, I just want you to look at me one more time and realize I’m still the same Bastiam ok?”
-“Babe stop saying nonsense. Here, I’ll put them on for you” I said while grabbing the pair of glasses he had in his hands. WOW he was right I’ve never seen anything like those lenses before. They were very weird looking. 
I put them on him and gave him a passionate kiss before he could open his eyes. We were still naked and I could feel his manhood growing again. 

-“Ohh so it seems you don’t have to see me to get turned on uh” I said
-“No, the simple presence of you turns me on”
-“Ok then I’ll have this and you’ll take this time to accept your eyesight as it is, and understand that I fell in love with you for who you are. I don’t care about the glasses and neither should you. This is the last time you made love without your glasses.” I took his glasses and put them on the side table, I guided him to the bed and I could see his eyes turning in a little bit. His vacant look aroused me like I’ve never experienced before. 
 
-“Can you see me?” I asked
-“No, I can’t” 
-“It’s ok, and repeat after me I CAN’T SEE YOU AND IT’S OK”
He did 
I took a step closer and asked the same question, the answer was still no. I had him reapeating that it was ok until I was ontop of him again.
-“Can you see me Bastiam?” I asked loudly
-“No, I can’t see you. I Can’t see your face, I can’t see you”
-“Can you feel me?”
-“Yes I can, I want you so badly” he said
-“Then you need to remember It’s ok if you can’t see, cause I’m here. If you can’t see the world I’ll be your eyes, If you can’t see me I’ll come closer so you can feel me” 
He hugged me tight and said he’s never felt so loved before. 
We made love again and again, he kept his eyes closed but occasionally he opened them and I could see his vacant look focusing on nothing. One eye pointed to one side of the room and the other was straight.
When I was down on my knees pleasuring him, he kept saying “I can’t see you, I can’t see your face, I can’t see you there. And I’ve never been happier. Keep going please, don’t stop”
 
Two months have passed since I moved to Natal and I’m not planning on going elsewhere. Bastiam and I are living an amazing life. 

Sometimes he wears his contacts but when he needs to read something he grabs my +3.50 glasses, I decided to wear my +2.00 all the time, and I still have a little hard time looking at things in the distance but I think Bastiam likes my nerdy look.

Now I get that that’s why he didn’t drove to the airport, he can’t. That’s why he had a sign with my name, he wasn’t gonna be able to see me…
In case you were wondering, his visual acuity with glasses is worse than 20/250, with contacts slightly better and without glasses he can’t even count fingers. His glasses prescription is 

O.D.
SPH. -32.5 CYL -3.75 AXIS 120°
O.S.
SPH. -34 CYL -4.5 AXIS 60°

(I Still don’t know what it means, but I LOVE to see his glasses on him.)
