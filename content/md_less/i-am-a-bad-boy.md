In our family my mom wears glasses for myopia, and my dad wears reading glasses.
My name is Tyler, I am the youngest in the family.
Crazy as it is ,I would love to wear glasses,  I think they are fantastic.
I always loved the looks of my mothers glasses.
None of my friends wear glasses , so I never got a chance to find out what wearing glasses is like.
I always notice any person who wears glasses and always wish it was me.

My twin sisters  Katie and Ashley are about two years older  than me.
They always behave as if they are the most beautiful women in the world., and spend hours in the bathroom.
Sometimes I wonder if I need a number to get into the bathroom.
I always hear a lot of complaining  about their hair,skin, headaches, pains and other discomforts.
At their last visit to the doctor ,they complained to him about having a lot of  headaches.
The doctor suggested they should have an eye exam.
They were shocked,there was nothing wrong with their beautiful brown eyes.
My sisters did not want to go for an eye exam.
My mother is the boss, and she arranged for an eye exam.

Two very nervous girls walked behind my mother into the optical store.
After filling out the requested information, Katie went into the examination room for her eye exam.
My mother suggested to Ashley she look at the different frames on display, to get some idea which frames might look good.
Ashley refused to do that she was not interested.
When Katie came out of the examination room she was in tears, mom I have to wear glasses.
The optometrist came out to talk to my mother.
He told her Katie was hyperopic and had some astigmatism.
If she wears her glasses full time , she should have fewer headaches , and when reading put less strain on her eyes.
When my mother asked about contact lenses, the doctor told her perhaps after her eye exam next year.
When Ashley came out of the examination room she had the same story.
It took them a long time to select a frame that they thought looked not to bad.
Their glasses would be ready the following afternoon.

That night both parents tried hard to make the girls feel better about having to wear glasses.
They suggested that the next day at school they tell all their friends that they would be wearing  glasses the next day.
Than they wont be surprised when they see you wearing glasses.

I am mad , why did my sisters have to wear glasses and not me.

One night when I went into the bathroom, I noticed one of my sisters glasses.
I picked them up,and put them on.
I looked around and realized I could see a bit wearing the glasses.
What a wonderful feeling it was to feel the glasses on your face.
I would love to have my own.
My sister knocked on the bathroom door.
Are you going to be in there all night ?
I need my glasses.

A new boy came into our class.
He had just moved into town.
He is about my size,good looking, and he wears glasses.
I sure like the looks of him.
I introduced myself , he said glad to meet you my name is Jim.
We soon became friends and started to visit each other.
One day when I was at his place , I asked him if  I could try his glasses.
Jim handed me his glasses, and I put them on.
The prescription was not to strong and I could see reasonably well wearing them.
He commented how good I looked wearing glasses.
I looked at myself in the mirror  and loved the look of me wearing glasses
Jim said boy you look good , your face is made to wear glasses. 
I hated to take them of and give them back to him.
Jim told me how he loves wearing glasses and looking at people wearing glasses, especially guys.
I told him how I loved  glasses and always wanted to wear them.
Well perhaps I can help you.
He went to his dresser, and pulled out a glasses case., containing a nice black pair of glasses.
Here you can have these , they are my last pair , and the prescription is not very strong.
I am myopic and the lenses are -.0.75.
I put the glasses on and looked around, and was surprised how well I could see.wearing them.
Jim told me ha loves my new look.
I could not believe ,that I had a pair of glasses now.
I looked at the glasses case, and noticed Shakespeare Optical.
Jim told me he loved getting his glasses there ,they have an all male staff.
They can teach you lots of things.
Dr Shakespeare is always there to help you.
I was so happy wearing glasses now that I almost forgot to take them off when I came home.

I took the glasses to school and wore them any time I could.
After a couple of weeks I noticed , that when I took my glasses off everything in the distance looked fuzzy.
One night at supper my sister asked me where i had gotten the glasses that I was wearing at school to day
I told her that at math class I sat in the back and could not see the blackboard to well .
I borrowed a pair of glasses  from Jim , he always carries a spare pair of glasses , and I forgot to return them.
When my mother heard this she told me she make an appointment for an eye exam .

When I got together with Jim he laughed , and told me how glad he was for me .
Now you will have your own glasses
He pulled me close and gave me a hug, and we had a great time.

Jim went with me when I had my eye exam.
After the exam the doctor told I was myopic and had some astigmatism.
My prescription read -,075 for the right and - 1.00 for the left eye.
We had  great time selecting a frame that we both thought looked just right.
After the optician did the measurements we went to the mall ,.

When we went to pick up the glasses they were ready.
I put the glasses on and was very happy how well I could see.
When I looked at myself in the mirror I was so happy , I looked great.
Jim told me I looked adorable.

we went to Jim s place and celebrated before I went home
.When I came home , everybody commented on how good I looked.
 My sisters had to try my glasses , and wondered how I could see a thing  . I must be blind.

A few weeks late , my sister wanted to talk to me .
She asked me , what were you doing kissing Jim?
I saw you when I went to see a movie and sat a few rows behind you.
I was not kissing him just whispering in his ear.
You were not. Are you gay?
I don t know , I like Jim and we are good friends .
I am thinking of telling mom and dad about it.
Something must be done about that .
I think  you are a BAD boy !
