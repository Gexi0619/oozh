The Teacher, and her box of glasses.


Let me tell you about myself, my name is Sandy, I think, I am a well figured, brunette, with nice shoulder length hair. 
I am proud of my looks, and my figure, and yes, I do wear glasses, I am myopic, and started to wear glasses when I was in grade three, and my present prescription, reads OD -3.00, and OS -2.75.
I like wearing glasses, and love trying different frames, and I am always excited, when selecting a new frame after, my annual eye exam.
I think, everybody should wear glasses, people who wear glasses, are so much nicer to look at.
Two of my three best girl friends wear glasses, and my boyfriend wears glasses
So now you know, how I feel about GLASSES.


I am now a qualified teacher, and was accepted for a teaching position, at a very fancy, all girls 
boarding school.
I will be teaching health, social studies, and geography, to grade 3, and 4 students. 
Now I am really looking forward, to the start of school, a well paying position, and students at age range that I prefer, why? well I will tell you.


You know, how I feel about glasses, well I did not tell you, how I love the looks of young girls wearing glasses.
A young girl wearing glasses, looks studious, serious, and confident.
It does not matter what kind of hairdo, or hair color they have, when they wear glasses, they always look so sweet, and adorable.
Since I am going to teach children, who at that age, where they might start becoming myopic, I expect, and hope, that I will be looking at a large number of them who will be wearing, or soon will start wearing glasses.


Now, I will tell you, how I started to appreciate the young girl glasses look.
My niece Kelley, stays with me quite often,.
One day Kelley found my first pair of glasses, and started to wear them, when at my place.
Kelley looks so cute, wearing glasses, and she loves to wear the glasses.
So together we searched an on line glasses retailer for frames, that Kelley really liked.
We tried the different frames, with her picture, and then, I ordered, two different pairs with an -0..50 prescription, and two pairs with a -1.00. prescription, so she can wear them when at my place.
The next time Kelley came to my place, she tried all four frames, and we had lots of fun.
Every time she came, she wore the glasses, and she and I loved it.
Shortly after, Kelley had an eye exam, and is now proudly wearing her own new prescription glasses. 
I saved all the glasses Kelley used, and knew, someday I would find some good use for them.


About two weeks before classes started, I met all the teachers, I would be working with.
They are all female, and what really surprised me that they all wear glasses.
The head mistress, made us all aware that we, because of the small number of students in each class, are to be sure to get to know each student well, and to report to her, any thing, we might find not as it should be, so when she thinks, it is if necessary, she can inform the parents.


During the summer, I had spend some time on my computer, and realize, that children, when they start puberty, usually put on weight, and go through periods of growth, and that is when myopia usually, starts affecting their vision, and that is the age of the girls I will be teaching.
I will have to watch carefully, for any signs of changes, so I can notify the head mistress.
This also gives me an idea, that might work .
I will have to make sure, that I don't forget to look after that..


The grades, that I teach, have only 12 to 15 students in each class.
To day, I had the first meeting with my students., and I had to learn all their names, and remember what they look like.
In grade three, only three out of 14 girls wear glasses, in grade four, there are five, out of 15
I noticed, that two girls wear glasses for hyperopia, all the rest are myopic.


My first class teaching health, I spend some time, explaining why some people need to wear glasses, and others do not, and that they should tell me, when they have a problem, seeing clearly, what I point out on the wall maps, or write on the white board, I may be able to help them.
It was not long after, that Casey, a grade 4 student came to me and asked me if she could sit closer to the front, she told me the wall map, and writing on the white board was looking fuzzy..
I showed Casey, my box of glasses, and told her, she was welcome to try the glasses, to find out if they would improve her vision.
I handed her a pair of - 0.50, and a pair of -1.00 glasses to try.
When the class was finished, Casey told me that she liked the one pair better, which were the -1.00 glasses, and asked me if she could keep them, she would like to wear them all the time, because she can see so much better, when wearing the glasses. 
Well Casey, you may, and I will inform the head mistress, so she can arrange with your parents for an eye exam.
When I informed the head mistress,, who is also myopic, about Casey, and my box of glasses, she told me, she sure liked the idea, I did the right thing, every child should have perfect vision. 
The next day, after Casey had told the other girls, about the glasses, two more girls are wearing my glasses now.
I wonder now, how many of the girls will be full time wearing glasses, when they come back after their Christmas break.


What a surprise I got, when after the Christmas break, two girls in grade three, and five in grade four.,
came back wearing glasses.
I had expected about four would be wearing glasses, but had not expected to see seven, new glasses wearing faces..
What pleasure, to see all those cute girls wearing glasses, I love it, and wonder how many more? 
Only one more student asked me for my glasses, before the summer break.


Before going back to teaching after the summer, I had my yearly eye exam.
I love going for an eye exam, talking to the optometrist, and going through the whole procedure.
When she asked me about my job, I told her about the box of glasses, she agreed with the head mistress 
that it was a good way of finding out, if the child might be myopic.
When the optometrist handed me my prescription, I noticed that I had an increase of 1/2 diopter on both eyes, now I fell more justified, buying a new frame., and looking forward to wearing the stronger lenses.


When my new glasses were ready, and put them on, loved my new look, the new frame looked so nice, and the lenses now, show some more rings.
My boyfriend loves my new look, and is jealous, because my prescription, is higher than his.
When, he tried my glasses, told me he can see so much better wearing them, and after his next exam, 
he is sure will have a higher prescription than I have now.
I wished him good luck.


After the summer break, I was informed, that I now would only teach grade 3 students all their subjects., and a new teacher came to teach grade 4 students.
The new teacher, is about my age, a very pleasant, good looking girl, with a beautiful head of red hair.
Surprise, Sandy does not wear glasses.
Sandy, and I sure liked each other, and we soon became friends,
To save money, she moved in with me at my apartment, as we are not living at the school.


My new class of grade three students, have only three girls out of fourteen wearing glasses.
I am certain that will change, before the end of the school year.
Now when I write on the white board, I have perfected my skill to write smaller, which might make it a bit more difficult to read, and I am sure, some students will have to use the glasses, to be able to read.
Sooner, than I had expected, three students are wearing glasses, out of my box right now. and all three are wearing the glasses all the time now.
I don't inform the headmistress now, until I am sure they cannot do their work, without wearing glasses.
Before the Christmas break, 2 of the three students, are wearing -1.00 glasses, and one more student, 
has started , to wear the glasses.
I notified, the headmistress, and I am looking forward to see the girls all come back, after the Christmas break, wearing their own new glasses.


Well , I guessed right, the 4 girls who had used my glasses, are all wearing their own new glasses.
Now half the girls in my class are wearing glasses, I just love looking at those cute glasses wearing girls.
To night at our apartment, Sandy asked me, what's up? all those girls in your class wearing glasses?
So, I told her about my box of glasses, and writing a little smaller.
Sandy said what is it about glasses?
What is so special and exciting?
So I told her that wearing glasses was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I enjoy the improved vision, I like the fashion part, of getting new frames, and love the looks of glasses, on me and everybody else, especially young girls.
Sandy, agreed a lot of people look good wearing glasses, and girls who wear glasses, do look cute and studious, but I never realized, wearing glasses can be enjoyable.
The next day, I showed Sandy, the box of glasses, and she asked to bring the box of glasses with me, she would like to find out more about them.
That night when I showed Sandy the glasses, she tried the -0.50, and the the -1.00, prescriptions.
and realized, that looking through the lenses, made everything further away, nice and clear.
Ashley, I can't believe it, how gasses can improve your vision like that, do you think, I need to wear 
glasses?
Only an eye exam, will give you the answer for sure, but I think you might be myopic, and don't realize it.
So sandy wanted to try my glasses, and liked the way she looked wearing them, bu could not see very well.
Ashley, I think, I will arrange for an eye exam, now I want to find out if I need to wear glasses.


A couple of weeks later, when Sandy came back after the weekend break, she was wearing glasses.
I pretty near fainted, Sandy looked so fantastic wearing glasses, I could not believe my eyes.
I walked over to her to have a close look, and could not help myself, when I gave her a kiss.
Sandy said, if I had known before, that me wearing glasses, would do that to you, I would have gotten them before, and yes, you are right, wearing glasses is no problem, and I like my new look.
Later looking at Sandy's prescription, I notice her right eye was -1.25. and her left eye -1.00
I love looking at Sandy, she looks so beautiful wearing glasses, I don't know what is happening to me but I feel like hugging and kissing her, I never was attracted like this to a women before.
What is happening to me?


Sandy, told me all the girls in her class remarked on her wearing glasses now, and two students, had asked her if she had a glasses box.
I loved her story, and asked Sandy if she was going to have a glasses box?
Sandy told me, she most likely will, she now is starting to enjoy looking at girls who wear glasses.
It did not take Sandy long to order glasses for her glasses box, she also ordered more glasses for herself.
Sandy, likes wearing glasses now, and she is lucky, because of her red hair, so many different color frames can look good on her.
She is now all excited, waiting for her order to arrive.


I received a letter to day, from my boyfriend, telling me he has a new girlfriend now.
It was no surprise to me, one of my girlfriends had seen him, with another girl, and had told me.
well, if he is that kind of a guy , I don't want him.
I think, I am starting to like girls better.
When, I told Sandy, about my break up, all she said was, great.


When we came home Friday night, Sandy's glasses order had arrived.
we decided, that it would be to exciting, to open the parcel, and decided to eat first, and then open the parcel.
Sandy, opened the glasses boxes one at the tine, and then put the glasses on, so we could see how they looked, it was so exciting, that shortly after, I felt myself all wet.
Sandy's choice for her glasses box was excellent, I am quite sure the girls in her class are going to like them.
That night, Sandy had to try each new pair of glasses , again and again, and I had to try them to show her, what I looked like wearing the gasses.
Trying all those glasses, and consuming some wine, did something to both of us, and we ended up, for the first time, sleeping in one bed.
Good thing it was the weekend, we had a wonderful time.

Sandy's, new glasses box, was a great success, all the girls loved it, and her 5 pair of glasses, are now being used all the time.
This is, how we get the enjoyment, of looking at girls wearing glasses, they look so sweet and nice.
Using the glasses box, sure worked.
