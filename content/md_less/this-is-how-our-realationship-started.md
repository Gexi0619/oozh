I'm 17 years old now and for the last 5 years I have managed to fake my school eye test.
My right eye has perfect vision but I can't see much out of my left eye.I I have a very good memory so when I have to read the letter with my left eye I know them off by heart.

I hate the thought of having to wear glasses,and I'm determined never to get any.

I have a new boyfriend. He was head boy at college.. He had been going out with Julie for the last 3 years, but at the start of the spring term she arrived at school wearing glasses ,I heard. Him say she looked like a nerd, and he liked me because I did not need glasses.

I had an interview for my first job but I need a driving licence 
I was very excited about getting it 
I arrived at the licence centre, but I failed the eye test and was told to get my eyes tested.

I nervously opened the door at my local opticiens,I was greated by a very pleasant young girl and explained I had been sent for an eye test by the driving licence department 

The doctor put these strange glasses on me then he fitted this black disk Infront of my left eye and told got read the smallest line possible. That was easy,then he changed the letters to even smaller ones that was harder but after he put a different lens in and then I could read everything.

The Doctor smiled at me ,
I don't understand why they sent you here, you have very good vision, you can read the legal line without any correction,if you really wanted glasses I could give you a 0.25 lens to help for night driving.

I said I was not planing to drive at night.So I I would be ok without glasses.

That would be OK, at least nobody  needed to know I need glasses for night driving .

He then changed  the black disc and told me to read the smallest line,
That's when my world fell apart,I had to tell him I couldn't read any of the letters. He then changed the size of the letter on the screen on the wall, I told him I thought  there was a single shape at the top. .But I didn't know what it was. 
For what seemed hours he kept adding different lenses, each time I could see more letters,even then I couldn't see the smallest letters,he then took the black disc  off and told me to follow him outside, by now I was freaking out, what if any of my friends saw me outside wearing these things, he then hold me to close my left eye and read the Car number plate, that was easy, then he said to close my right eye and read a different Number plate, that was difficult  I had to take a couple of steps forward before I could read it clearly.
When we got back inside  he gave me a card to hold, I had to admite I couldn't read any of it. After a few changes of lens I could manage half of the letters 

Well young lady now I know why they sent you, have you broken your last pair of glasses 

He looked shocked when I said I had never had glasses or a test like this,
and hated glasses and was  never going to wear any.

Well I'm sorry but you will have to wear them now you can't get a driving licence or car insurance without wearing glasses as I have to inform the licence office that they will have to give you a restricted driving licence. 

“What does that mean” 

“You can only drive a car or insure it if you wear glasses,also no night driving untill I can give you your full prescription  after I have retested you in about 6 Months time.

I was starting to shake now.

“Do you mean I need to wear glasses for driving”

“No Miss”

 I started to feel happier now

“What I mean is you need to wear glasses ALL the time”.
“Your right eye is a little short sighted with a small amount of astigmationand in it but you are what we call legally blind in your left eye”

“How long have you known you have a problem with your left eye” 

“I first noticed I could not see as well with my left eye when I about 12 years old but I faked the school eye test by remembering the letters, I didn't want to know if it was getting any worse so I only closed my right eye for the school eye test, I am terrified of the thought of wearing glasses”


“We have to talk about what sort of frame you want and the lens we need to fit in them”
He handed me this piece of paper 
R - 0.25 -0.25  50 prism in 1
L  -12.75 - 3.75  180  prism out 10  Add 3.75 

“I will re-test you in 6 months and give you your full prescription then”

“What do you mean my full prescription”

“Your left lens will be a very high prescription for a first pair on glasses  but to get 20/20  vision  we must wait until your eyes have adjusted to wearing glasses with this prescription ”

“We have to be carful the frames we choose, if we go to big the left lens will get much thicker and very heavy, but we have to allow enough depth for the bifocal lens.”

“What are bifocals? and why do I need them if I'm only wearing glasses to drive?”.

The muscles in your left eye are very weak so you need a different prescription for distance and readings.

“Unless you wear your glasses ALL the time you will soon start to get very bad headaches and straining your eyes will only make things worse”

“Is that why I get lots of headaches now”

“Will people notice that I can't  see much with my left eye”


“Let's wait and see what the lab can do, the basic lens and Frames are free , but later if you can afford it they can fit thinner lens but the cost is much higher”

The Doctor sugested I wait in his office and keep the test frames on while they make MY GLASSES,that's a horrible word MY.
His receptions kindly brought me a coffee and stayed with me when she was not busy.she was wearing beautiful thin rimless glasses if mine were like that it would be as bad , I was still determined only to wear them for driving now

About an hour later she took me back into the Doctor testing room.
On his table was a tray with a cover over it,was this MY glasses hiding from under it.
As he took the cover off I wanted  to scream the right lens looked ok it was thin and just one piece  but the left lens was horrible it had a line going all the way across the lens and was nearly an inch thick
  
He gently took the test frames off of me,.what had happened everything seem blurry and double.
As he placed MY glasses on me I was shocked how bright and clear everthing was, only then did I realise that I had not had any headache while I was wearing the test frames 
He told me to look straight ahead then walk around the shop and close my right eye I couldn't  believe I could see perfect with my left eye, next he showed me how to use the bifocal part of the lens for reading.
I was just thinking that maybe it wasn't so bad to wear glasses for driving. That was untill I turned and looked in the mirror. This time I screamed take them off of me please please.
My right eye looked normal but my left eye was tiny and that side of my face was shrunken in,and what we're all those lines going down the lens.

The receptionist came in and calmed me down. She took the glasses off of me and dried my eyes.
Within a few seconds everything looked blurred and doubled and my left eye seemed to be pulling inwards and I could feel the head aches coming back.

What was I saying 

“Can I have MY glasses back please”

The Doctor explained that's why I had to keep the glasses on,

The receptionist offered to take me to the licence department with a covering letter.

This time there was a very handsome young man at the desk.

I nervously explained that “I had failed the eye test and had got glasses now for driving”
“You look very pretty wearing them They look very nice on you miss, had you broken your old one I remember you had problems seeing any distance with your left eye”

I went bright red and stuttered that I had never worn glasses until today  and he was the only person to have seen me wearing them since I left the opticians, but I only needed them for driving, and I was going to take them off as soon as I passed the driving eye test.

He smiled 

“Ok let's get the paper work done ,what you name please”

He lent forward and opened the glasses case on his desk.

I'm sorry but I'm very long sighted I need my reading glasses”

My mouth dropped open, the lens were like two thick paperweights.

“I know miss, they make my eyes look enormous,I did wonder about getting bifocal lens like you have for your left eye”

Raplh helped me fill in the forms,Then he left me while I answered the question on the exam paper.
Even though I hated the glasses, I had to admit I could see so much better wearing them,it took me a little time to get used to raising my head to look though the reading section of the bifocal section,
If the left lens wasn't as thick I wouldn't have minded wearing them,but I couldn't be seen wearing such ugly things.

I handed Ralph my completed forms and got up ready to leave, he seemed to  notice me looking around.

“Your friend seems to have gone would you like a lift to town”

I did not know what to say. If I took my glasses off now I wouldn't be able to see to walk and if I kept them on in the car he would wonder why I still had them on.

“My car is just over there,please keep your glasses on you look very pretty wearing them and I'm sure you can see better now you have them” 

I just smiled,

My stomach was churning inside.I had hated the thought of wearing glasses and had not expected them to be as ugly as these but it was nice not having a headache and I could see so much better and strangely Ralph seemed to like them on me.
As we stopped at the traffic lights I pointed out the opticians were I had got my glasses and suggested maybe Ralph get some bifocals.

Ralph asked if I would like to have a meal with him as there was a nice restaurant in the next street.

As we sat down the waitress brought us the menu, I saw Ralph start to squint at the menu.

“Why don't you put your reading glasses on Ralph, I'm Sure  they will help”

Ralph went bright red

“Are you sure you don't mind me wearing them, I should wear them more really but I'm rather embarrassed wearing them the first time my girl friend saw me wearing them she laughed and dumped me”

“It's ok I understand, Will you keep them on while we eat our meal please and if you like I will keep mine on”

“Yes that would be nice 

“These are my first pair of glasses I'm sure my boyfriend will dump me as well so I think it's time to dump him first haha”
 “I only got them a few hours ago,And I just intended to wear them for driving, but they have stopped my headaches and if I take them off I see double now”
“I was to scared to take them off when you offered me a lift, my eyes seemed to have got used to them and I feel blind without them already”

“i should have got glasses 6 years ago ,but I hated the thought of wearing glasses,so I faked my school eye exam, I know my left lens is thick and ugly and the left side of my face looks srunking in with the glasses on , The eye Doctor said I'm legally blind in that eye without glasses also he said I should wear them all the time,but I  only got them because I failed the eye test for my licence”

“When  you came in before you kept closing your left eye”

“I did think you were either blind in that eye or it was a prosthetic eye you wore”

“O was it very noticeable,that I am nearly blind it that eye”

“You look very pretty wearing your glasses. So I think you should wear them all the time now please”

Ralph is going to get his eyes tested tomorrow, and ask if he can have bifocal lens like I have for my left eye.
Also he wants me to come with him.

THAT'S HOW ARE RELATIONSHIP STARTED
