Ashley sure is a lot different than my other child, her older brother Kevin.
She will soon be 6 years old.
She talks and explains things almost like an adult, loves to read, and watch T.V.
This morning she told me she loves eyeglasses and she wants to wear glasses.
Mommy, I want to wear glasses just like aunt Amy.
I asked her why?
Glasses make a person look so much nicer, and when wearing glasses you are able to see everything so much better.
I read the book of the little princess who wore glasses, and she can see better now and likes wearing her glasses.
I want to wear glasses, just like my doll, and the little princess and aunt Kim, I know I will be able to see everything perfect and I will look very nice.

My sister Kim is the only one in the family who wears glasses.
Kim started to wear glasses in grade one, she is myopic and told me that her present prescription is up to -9.00
Kim is well educated, has a good job, and is Ashley godmother.
Ashley always talks about Kim s glasses, how pretty they are, and how the lenses sparkle.
I talked to Kim and told her what Ashley had told me.
Karin, I know Ashley likes glasses, she has told me many times, all I can suggest let her have an eye exam.
Besides, I have a noticed a few signs that she might need to wear glasses.
I have noticed when she reads, she holds her book very close, and when watching T V likes to sit not to far away from the screen. and when looking out of a window she squints.
If she does not need glasses, get her a pair with clear lenses, that will make her happy.
Well I think Kim may be right, she had noticed some of Ashley s viewing habits, that I had not noticed,
Ashley is going into grade one and we have to make sure that her vision is good, I will make an appointment for an eye exam.

When Ashley and I walked into the optical store she could not believe her eyes, a wall full of glasses
While I was telling the receptionist who we were, Ashley ran over the glasses display, looked, took a glasses frame, put the frame on, and came to me all smiles.
Mommy how do I look?
I told her she looked very nice, but you will have to wait trying frames, first the doctor has to examine your eyes.
When we were in the examination room and Ashley was seated in the examination chair, the first thing she told the female doctor, I love your glasses, I want to wear a pair just like that.
Ashley was full of questions, why are you doing this and that, and do I need glasses?
When she was finished, the optometrist told us that Ashley was quite myopic for her age,
her prescription is -1.25 for the right and – 1.00 for the left eye, and she would like to see her again in about 6 months.
Ashley was so happy, she will be wearing glasses.
After selecting a nice frame and the necessary measurements were taken, we went to the mall and looked around while waiting for Ashley s glasses to be ready.

When we went back to the optical store Ashley s glasses were ready.
She put the glasses on and looked at herself and was so happy, mommy, don t I look nice, I love my new look.
When she stood up and looked around said, these glasses are magic. 
I can see the leaves on the trees and I can read the signs across the road, I am so glad I wear glasses now and that I can see so well.

When Ashley started school, she told me that there were only two other children in her class who wore glasses.
When I asked her if anybody teased her about wearing glasses, she told me they would not dare.
Time goes fast and Ashley was due for another eye exam.
As the optometrist had expected Ashley needed a ½ diopter increase on both eyes, and also told me that she was afraid Ashley might become a high myopic.
Her glasses are quite strong for her age and she still has a lot of growing to do, and that usually means regular increases in the prescription.
When she asked me about eyesight problems in the family, I told her that my sister is myopic and wears – 9.00 glasses, and that she is the only one in the family until now.
The optometrist told me to be prepared,  Ashley might end up with a prescription close to, or the same as her aunt by the time she is in her early twenties.
I am sure glad that she enjoys wearing her glasses, I hope it lasts.

All through public school Ashley s prescription increased a little each year. 
When she went to high school her prescription read – 5.25 for the right and -5.00 for the left eye ,
and a little bit of astigmatism.
Ashley loves her new glasses with the stronger prescription. 
She told me many times how she loves the look of the stronger lenses, and hopes her lenses will get as strong as her aunt Kim.
Growing up Ashley had never any trouble being asked for a date. 
I am really surprised that so many boys like the looks of a girl wearing strong prescription glasses.

When Ashley was ready to go to college to become an optician, her prescription was  -7.50 for the right and – 7.25 for the left eye.
She loves the look of her new glasses and the stronger lenses.
I am so glad she still loves wearing glasses, I must say she looks very attractive, and is a beautiful young woman.
Not long after Ashley introduced me to a very handsome, glasses wearing young man.
Mom meet Matthew, my boyfriend.
The two seemed to love each other and are planning to get married after graduating.

Close to the day of the wedding Ashley picked up her – 9.00 glasses.
She is glad to now have her prescription the same as her aunt Kim, like she always wanted. 
The day Ashley and Matthew married, and I saw the sparkle on the lenses of their glasses,
was sure they most likely would be parents of glasses wearing children.
And I imagine they would tell Ashley they want to wear glasses just like mommy,
and most likely get their wish.

Ashley and Matthew did not wait long to start a family, and started in a big way with a set of twin girls and a little over a year later a boy.
The twins Jenny and Katie are very much like her mother at that age.
They were reading at the age of four, and are very mature for their age.
When I came to visit after I had started to wear glasses, they all told me how nice I looked.
Then the girls told me they were going to wear glasses when they grew up, just like mommy and daddy.
Since the girls did so much reading, and would soon be going to school Ashley arranged for an eye exam.
Both girls were prescribed glasses for myopia, and their brother Matthew a year later was prescribed glasses  for hyperopia and some astigmatism.
I was not surprised, that my grandchildren needed to wear glasses, with two myopic parents. 
What really surprised me is that Matthew is hyperopic.
All three children look adorable wearing glasses, and are happy wearing them.
I am now a very proud grandmother, of a glasses wearing family. 
I will always remember Ashley saying,
Mommy I want to wear glasses, just like Aunt Kim.
