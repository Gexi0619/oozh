This story is 100% true. I think anybody that reads both my fantasy and true posts on here knows I'm a big NASCAR and stock car racing in general fan. Even on fantasy stories I've sneaked something that happened in NASCAR on the day the story is on.
One Sunday in the mid 90's while reading the magazine that comes with the Parade magazine that comes with the newspaper there was an article that talked about Bolle wraparound sunglasses. I liked the looks of them but didn't think with wearing regular glasses I could wear them. That was until I read about the prescription inserts. I ordered a pair with the inserts with my prescription in them. The Bolles looked just like regular sunglasses and while wearing them and people looking at you couldn't tell the inserts were in them. A coworker had prescription Oakley sunglasses around the same time frame and frankly I thought they looked stupid. I forget where I bought the sunglasses but Lenscrafters made the inserts. I used these glasses for a couple of years until I needed a prescription update which that overpriced optical I mentioned said I needed to buy new glasses. I told them they kiss a portion of my body.
I happened to be a fan of the late Dale Earnhardt who tragically was killed on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500. Dale's Son who was racing just ahead of him when the wreck happened has retired from driving and now is a TV analyst on NBC's coverage of the races.
Dale Earnhardt or "Big E" as he was sometimes referred to wore Gargoyle sunglasses similar to the Bolle. I started checking and they could be ordered with prescription inserts so I did. The Gargoyles were similar to the Bolles in the way the insert was not visible except to the person wearing them. The Oakley sunglasses with prescription as a weird shape on the lenses. I used these sunglasses until I had Lasik in 2001 which as I have detailed in other posts on here started going bad about 8 years from the procedure. After Lasik I tried taking the inserts out but the inside of the sunglasses was scratched. I even tried selling them with the insert on Ebay but got no takers. I then got a new identical pair without inserts which I almost never wore due after Dale's death I quit wearing all my gear related to him. I even had a neighbor take the Dale Earnhardt license plate off the front of my car because I couldn't bear to do so myself. Before anybody asks I have no idea what happened to either pair of sunglasses with the inserts. In closing I must admit I enjoyed being able to wear what looked like regular sunglasses for a time with the inserts. I now have prescription sunglasses that I ordered from www.zennioptical.com.
