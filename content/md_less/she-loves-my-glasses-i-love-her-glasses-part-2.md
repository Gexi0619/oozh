To enjoy this story be sure to read part  1 first.

Dave and Megan broke up, and I missed talking with Megan, I really liked that girl very  much.

I graduated from high school and went to college.
I had been there about 3 weeks , when walking around the campus, thought I saw a familiar face. I walked over to see who it was, and realized it was Megan. I was so happy.
She was all smiles when she saw me, came over and gave me a big hug.
She was there to pick up a book ,and did not have much time right now, but we agreed to meet later and go fore a bite to eat.
I was so excited to have seen Megan again , I could not believe it.

When we got together at a restaurant, and we sat down and looked at each other and smiled.
After a lot of chit, chat , Megan asked me if I had a boyfriend.
I told her I had been on a few dates, but never anything serious.
Why did you break up with David?
Well I thought I was interested in boys, and David was a nice guy, but I realized I prefer girls.
Megan told me how she loved glasses , and looking at girls who wear glasses.
She told me that on the day I tried her glasses, thought I was the nicest girl she ever met.,and now wearing glasses you are perfect.
I took her hand and squeezed it,and told her how she had impressed me the first time we met.
We talked about our likes and dislikes, and soon realized we had a lot in common.
When tit was time to go home , we arranged to meet at the mall on Saturday, and do some window shopping.
I was really looking forward to Saturday and my date with Megan.
We met at the food court,had some refreshments, and went wandering through the mall.
When we came past the optical store, Megan suggested we go in and try some frames., it was one of her favorite pastimes.
We went in , and really  enjoyed ourselves trying all the different frames.
After a while we decided  we should go and see a movie,
We enjoyed the movie and had a great time holding hands and exchanging a few kisses.
It sure was an enjoyable afternoon.
We decided we meet at the mall again the following Saturday.

It was a busy week. between lectures, some tests and studying.  
I also had an appointment for an eye exam.
After the exam the doctor told me my prescription was now - 2.00 on  both eyes., so I would have to buy new glasses.
I decided to wait till Saturday so Megan and I could go shopping for glasses

I was looking forward to Saturday, and seeing Megan again.
When I met Megan at the mall, we had a hug and a quick kiss, and sat down in the food court. 
I have a real surprise for you Megan., I have to go and get new glasses, my prescription changed.
Megan said great, I love nothing better, Let s go I am all excited.
When we entered the optical shop, there was a sign, that the 2 for 1 sale was on.
Megan made sure I was getting the best looking glasses available.
After the measurements we were told the glasses would be ready about 1 o clock.

After we picked up my new glasses ,we decided to go to Megan s place.
When we got there I modeled my new glasses for her, she loved it, and of course had to try my
glasses , and soon we realized our prescriptions were identical.
When Megan tried one of my new glasses, she looked so good, I could not help myself .
I pulled her close and kissed her, and she kissed me back, and we kissed some more 
This happens when you get all excited playing with glasses with a girl you love .
and who loves you just as much, and is just as crazy about glasses as you are.
I love her glasses and she loves mine , and we love each other.
