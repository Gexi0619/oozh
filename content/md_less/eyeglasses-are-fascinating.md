Eyeglasses are fascinating..

My name is  Ashley, after graduating from college I went to work in the office of a large insurance company, 
I have nice dark blond hair, a pretty good figure and I am happy with my looks.
At work on my left is Kelley s desk, a pretty dark haired girl about my age, and on my right is a very nice older woman, who wears glasses with very thick lenses that  make her eyes look very small.

When you work in a large office the lunchroom is a good place to meet some of your fellow workers
Kelley asked me to come along and we sat at a table with about 6 other people
She introduced me to them, of course I did not remember all their names, but was very impressed with one guy.
His name is David, a handsome glasses wearing dark haired men.
I really enjoyed the conversation I had with him.
When we got back to our desk, I asked Kelley about David.
She told me not to get my hopes up, he is gay and has a boyfriend.
A few days later when we sat at the same table for lunch, we noticed that Jenny was now wearing glasses 
 Kelley and I complimented her on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
She thanked us, and told us that she is very happy having to wear glasses , she had always wanted to wear glasses,
 That she liked wearing glasses really surprised me. 
I know very little about glasses, so I asked her if glasses are comfortable to wear.
She told me that if properly adjusted they are very comfortable, and you don t even know you are wearing them.
She asked me if I would like to try her glasses 
I told her I would like to, that I never had tried prescription glasses 
So I put the glasses on, they felt very nice and comfortable, and when I looked around everything looked sharper and more defined, I sure liked that.
I gave Jenny her glasses back and told her I was surprised they were so comfortable.
Kelley told me, I looked terrific wearing glasses.

On Friday Kelley asked me if I would like to go out with her that night to a bar and meet the gang.
 I am glad I did, I really enjoyed it, I met a lot of new people my own age, and there was good music.
I danced with guys and girls and had a great time.
 When we went home Kelley told me most of the group met there every Friday night, and that every week you likely see some new faces.

When I went back to work on Monday, Cheryl, and a guy I did not know came to work wearing glasses.
After trying Jenny s glasses ,and her telling me she likes wearing glasses ,which had surprised me.
I became more aware of people who were wearing glasses.
When I looked around the office, was surprised that I had never noticed before that so many people wore glasses. 
Men wearing glasses seemed to look more studious and business like.
I also noticed how nice most women looked wearing glasses.
During the lunch hour I asked Cheryl how she found out that she needed glasses.
She told me she had a lot of headaches and her doctor had suggested to get an eye exam.
 She mentioned that since she started to wear the glasses had noticed an improvement in her vision and so far no headaches.
Cheryl let me try her glasses and when wearing them,  could not see very well,  they sure were very different then Jenny s glasses

When on Friday Kelley and I went back to the bar to have a good time,.I met Lindsay a cute girl who wears glasses.
She asked me to dance, and then to sit and talk with her.
 S o I sat with her, she was funny, I liked her. we had a lot of laughs..
Then she asked me to wear her glasses, so she could see what I looked like wearing glasses.
When I put her glasses on , and looked around was surprised that I could see so well wearing her glasses,  and how clear and defined everything looked.
 She told me I looked adorable and that I should wear glasses all the time.
I told her I did not think I needed to wear glasses.
  She suggested I should start wearing glasses, then I could be her special girlfriend because
she loves girls who wear glasses.
 I told her I did not think so, and excused myself, 
When I went looking for Kelley, I bumped into a very handsome glasses wearing guy, who asked me to dance with him.
 His name is Trevor, he was easy to talk to, and an excellent dancer
  He mentioned that he had seen me wearing Lindsay s glasses., and that I looked fantastic wearing glasses
 We sat down and had some refreshments, and while we were talking ,I noticed he seemed to look at almost every girl who wore glasses. 
We danced some more, and had a great time., and agreed to meet again the following Friday.
When Kelley and I went home she told me that Lindsay is a lesbian and looking for a girlfriend.
She also mentioned that Trevor is one of those guys who likes girls who wear glasses.
Now I realized why Trevor looked at every girl who wore glasses.
I had never known that some men preferred girls who wore glasses .
I started to wonder what was so special about glasses 
 Why some people loved wearing glasses, and others loved looking at people who wore glasses,
I like to find out more about glasses, and what makes them so fascinating. 


 I went shopping in the mall on Saturday to look for some new clothes. 
When I passed the optical store, I looked trough the window at all the glasses on display,.
 Curiosity got the better of me.  
 I decided to go in and have a look around and see if I could find out what is so special about glasses .

.I was greeted by a very pretty glasses wearing optician,
When I told her I was just looking , she told me that was fine. 
 She showed me around, and asked me if I would like to try some of the frames so I could see how I would look wearing glasses.
I told her I would like that, so I tried some different frames.
I could not believe how good I looked wearing some of the frames.
She complimented me on how nice I looked, and asked me when I had my last eye exam.
I told her I never had one.
When she finished telling me why everybody should have regular eye exams, I realized I should make an appointment to make sure my eyes were healthy,
When I asked about an appointment , she told me  that they had a cancellation , and I could have an  eye exam in about 15 minutes.
I told her that was fine, I filled out some paperwork and waited.
 I was a bit nervous, I had no idea what to expect. 
  When I went into the room for the eye exam, noticed it looked very different from our doctors examination room.
When the exam started the optometrist shone a bright light into my eyes and really looked at them,  and after a while he told me my eyes were healthy. 
Then he asked me to read the letters on the wall, I told him some looked a little fuzzy.
  I heard some clicks and all the letters were now nice and clear.
 So I told him that was better, now I could read them.
A few more tests, and the exam was finished.
 The optometrist told me I was myopic and when wearing glasses would notice a big improvement in my vision.
I was surprised at first, but then realized that when I had tried Kelley s and Lindsay s glasses ,   everything had looked more clear and sharp, and should have been a message for me that my vision was not perfect, and I might need glasses. 

I took my prescription to the optician ,
She helped me select a nice frame.,took some measurements and told me to come back in about an hour and my glasses would be ready,

When I went to the lunch counter for some refreshments,  noticed that I had trouble reading he menu board on the wall, now I know why I need to wear glasses
 While having some refreshments and looking around noticed quite a few adults and children wearing glasses.
 I started to wonder what it would be like to wear prescription glasses all the time.
Would I like wearing glasses? 
How would I look wearing glasses, and what reaction would I get from other people.
I really liked the frame that I had selected and realized I needed to wear glasses.
 Now I was getting all excited, and could hardly wait for my new glasses to be ready.

When I went back to the optical store,  was told my glasses were ready.
  I put the glasses on and looked around and noticed how clear and sharp everything looked,
 I could not believe how the glasses had improved my vision, it was fantastic.
When I looked in the mirror , loved my new look , the frames blended so nicely with the color of my hair,  I might like wearing glasses
Going home  Ithought about the day I had, I certainly had not expected that when I went shopping for some new clothes at the mall this morning , that I would be going home wearing glasses in the afternoon.

When I came home ,my mother was very surprised when she saw me wearing glasses and wanted to know all about it.
 After I had told her my story, she agreed I had done the right thing having an eye exam, and that I looked very nice wearing glasses
My younger sister Karen loved my new look and asked if she could try my glasses.
When she put them on said wow, everything looks so nice and clear, I can even read the sign across the street.
I asked her to please give me my glasses back, I think you will need to get your own glasses 
She agreed and told me she would make an appointment for an eye exam, after wearing my glasses, and seeing so much better, she was sure she needed to wear glasses 

When I went to work on Monday,  received many compliments on my new look .
Kelley told me that  I looked fantastic wearing glasses ,and  also told me she  could not .wait till Friday , to see Trevor s reaction when he sees me wearing glasses 

I liked my new look and with  all the compliments I had received started to feel good having to wear glasses.

Friday night when Kelley and I went to the bar , Lindsay came over and told me I looked beautiful wearing glasses and asked me will you be my girlfriend now ?
I thanked her for asking and told her not tonight.
When Trevor noticed me and I saw the look on his face started to smile .
He looked as if his eyes were ready to pop out. 
 Finally he said Ashley I can t believe my eyes , you look so beautiful wearing glasses  what a surprise. 
Trevor wanted to know when I got my glasses, did I like wearing them ,and a whole lot of other questions.
When we danced he kept om looking at me and smiled.
He told me how he loved the look of my myopic lenses , and how nice my eyes looked.
 When Trevor took me home he asked me for another date ,and then kissed me good night,

My sister Karen came home to day wearing glasses,
 She thanked me for letting her try my glasses., and finding out that she needed to wear glasses 
She loves her new glasses ,  loves her new look and is very happy with her improved vision. 
She told me that she  had received many compliments and had  noticed that quite a few guys really looked at her and she liked all the attention.

A lot of things have happened since I graduated from business college , 
I have a good job , that I like and I met a lot of nice people 
After I tried wearing some of the girls glasses ,became more aware of glasses , and how many people wore glasses .
 I  became curious to know more about glasses , went into the optical store and came out of the store wearing glasses.
 Because of me wearing glasses  my sister now wears glasses, and loves them.
I have a great boyfriend and we both like wearing glasses 
  One thing for sure Eyeglasses are fascinating
