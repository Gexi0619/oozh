I, should not have done it.! 


I, Joanne, and my husband Karl, just moved into a nice house, where we hope to raise a family, in the future..
Karl, has a good job, that he likes.
My work in the mall, is at a bookstore, where I am the assistant manager.
I love reading, and find that most of our customers, are well read, which I like, it makes for good conversation.
What, I really like, is when previous customers, come in to look around, and want to talk to you.
You get to know them, and after you have, some conversation with the, have some idea, what their literary preferences are.. 
To day, Mrs. Jones dropped in, to ask me, if we had any new books that she might be interested in.
Yes, here is a book, that you might like.
She glanced at it for a few minutes, and when she looked at her watch and said,, I better get out of here, or I will be late for my eye exam.
Well, I am sure, she will be back, to buy the book..


When, I had my day off, I met one of my new neighbor's, a very pleasant, glasses wearing woman, about my age.
She lives, two doors down from my place, and has one child, an adorable little girl.
When we talked, I found out, that while she was pregnant, her vision had changed, and she was prescribed, to wear glasses.
I had never heard, of that happening before, but I don’t know very much about glasses, or being pregnant.


The following week, Mrs. Jones was in the store again.
When I approached her, I noticed, that, she is wearing glasses now.
When, I greeted her, I told her how nice she looks wearing glasses.
She thanked me, and told me, she now love wearing glasses, my vision is perfect, and my husband likes my new look.
I bought two pairs of glasses, because I like the looks of me wearing the glasses.
Here let me show you, this is my second pair, they are beautiful.
After she showed me the glasses, we talked about a new book, she might like, she bought the book, before she left.


This past weekend, my sister and her family, came over to visit. 
We had not seen her, and her family for a while.
I could not believe, how their appearances had changed that much, since the last time, we met with them.
My sister, and her husband, as well as their daughter, are wearing glasses now.
Megan, I did not know, that all of you, are wearing glasses now,
Then, she told me, that her daughter, had trouble at school, seeing what was written, on the blackboard.
When Sadie had her eye exam, she was prescribed to wear glasses,
Because, I was due for an eye exam, I had my eye exam, I found out, that I needed to wear glasses.
When my husband, tried my glasses, he realized, that, he should be wearing glasses.
He was right, he had an eye exam, and now wears glasses


That night talking, with my husband, about the fact, that lately, so many people, I know, are wearing glasses no.
I wonder, what might be the reason, they all need to wear glasses.?
Well, I have noticed, at the office, more than half of the staff, are wearing glasses now..
I think, the long hours of looking at computer screens, and the use of telephones, might be, why there is such an increase in the number of people, that have to wear glasses, I am no expert, I am only guessing.


To day, Mrs. Jones was in the store again, and as usual we talked, and while we were talking.
Mrs. Jones rummaged through her purse, to find something, .
What she did not realize, that her glasses case, fell out of her purse, and landed on the floor.
After she had left, I did some of my other regular jobs.


In the afternoon, I received a phone call, from Mrs. Jones, telling me she could not find her glasses, and that she is going on vacation, for the next 3 weeks., 
Might I have lost my glasses, at your store? 
I told her, that I would look for the glasses, and if we find them will give her a call, and keep her glasses, the glasses, till she comes back.


Shortly after Mrs. Jones had phoned, I looked around, and I noticed Mrs. Jones glasses, just below a kick plate,.
I picked the glasses case up, to check on the glasses.
When, I looked at the glasses, that looked so nice and shiny, something, happened to me, I now, had the strongest urge, to try the glasses.


I went to the bathroom, and when I got there, I opened the case, and put the glasses on.
When, I looked looked at myself, and loved my new look, I had never realized, I could look this good wearing glasses


When I looked around, wearing the glasses, everything I looked at, was so nice and clear, and more defined. 
What an experience, I loved it.
I put the glasses in my purse, and went back to work.


When Mrs. Jones, called me later in the day, I told her, Mrs. Jones I am sorry, but, we have not found your glasses yet, but we will keep on looking, and I am sure we will find the glasses.
I know, I should not have done that, but I did.


I wore the glasses, while driving home, and loved it how well I could see, and how comfortable the glasses were to wear.
I forgot to take the glasses off, when I came home, and when my husband, saw me wearing the glasses, said, why, you did not tell me, that you were getting glasses.?
Karl, I wanted to surprise you.
You sure did, and you should know by now, that, I don’t like surprises.
What, do you mean.?
You, know, we like to discuss things first,..
Do you like my new glasses look?
After looking, at you, I must say, the glasses look, not bad.
Do you mind, to see me wearing glasses?
No, if you need to wear them, wear the glasses, I will get used to your new look, I still think you are a beautiful girl, wearing glasses, or no glasses.
That made me feel better, because, I like the glasses, and know, I want to wear glasses.


Now, I know, that my husband, does not mind me wearing glasses, 
I will have to get my own glasses.
I made an appointment, for an eye exam, at the optical store in the mall.


In the meantime, I have been wearing the glasses, all day.
I had a couple, of complimentary comments at work. and now it feels as if, I have been wearing glasses, all my life.


At the day of the exam, during my lunch hour, I had forgotten to take my glasses off.
I told the optometrist, that I had borrowed the glasses, from my sister.
You did the right thing, coming in for an eye exam, because the prescription for your glasses, is going to be higher, and I have also added an add, to make reading, easier for you.


I was lucky, there was a 2 for1 sale, and I ordered, one pair the same as I have been wearing, and an other pair, that I like even better.
When the optician asked me, if I wanted, verifocals, or lined 
bi-focal's, I was completely confused, and after she explained the difference to me, I decided on varifocals, Karl sure would have noticed the line,
on the lenses, and I did not want anymore lectures.


When, my glasses, were ready, I noticed a big difference, in my vision, but I, had a hard time, getting used to wearing multi focal lenses.
I had no choice, I had to get used to wearing, my new glasses.,
Now, my husband expected me, to wear my glasses all the time.


A couple of weeks later, Mrs. Jones came to the store, to see, if we found her glasses.
Yes, we did, and I went to a drawer, to get the glasses, and then handed her the glasses.
You have no idea, how I missed the glasses, my husband kept on asking me about the glasses, because he thinks they look so much nicer, then the glasses, I am wearing. and that, spoiled a part of my holiday.
I felt guilty, after Mrs. Jones left,.
I guess, I should not have done it ,and should have returned the glasses when I found them. but I did not, and now, I am a happy girl, who wears glasses, and have a new look, that my husband approves off.
