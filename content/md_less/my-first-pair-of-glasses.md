I am Amy, 12 years old , have dark blond hair with a bit of curl. I am tall for my age, still growing and tarting to notice some changes in my body.My dad has a good job , and my mother stays at home to look after me and my 2 younger brothers.
We live in town, in a newer subdivision and I love our house and my nice bedroom.
I always walk to school with my best friend Sandy, she lives next door. Sandy is a very pleasant girl, she has dark hair , she is a bit of a tom boy , and lots of fun. We are in the same class at school.
This morning Sandy told me she could not meet me to walk to school with me , she has to go for an eye exam. to morrow .
Her sister wears glasses and is due for an exam. Her mother thought it best that she should have her eyes checked to.
Sandy told me she is all excited, she hopes she needs gasses, she is jealous of her sister wearing glasses, she told me she loves the looks of glasses and cannot wait to get her own.
I was really surprised when she told me that, she never mentioned glasses before.
I don t know very much about glasses, nobody in our family wears them. I have noticed a few girls at school who wear glasses, and some of them look very cute and they don t seem to mind wearing them.
Since Sandy had mentioned glasses and how she liked them, made me start to take more notice  of people wearing glasses.
Our classroom teacher wears glasses and looks very nice, I also realized that there are 5 students in our class who wear glasses.
Walking in the hall ways at school  noticed that there are quite a few students wearing glasses now.
When Sandy came over to my place the next day after school, I asked her how the eye exam went. She told me she was very disappointed that she did not need glasses , and her lucky sister had a change in prescription and was getting new glasses.

On Saturday Sandy came over to my place to do some homework, she was in a really good mood.
When I asked her what made her so happy, she pulled a pair of gold framed glasses out of her pocket and put them on.
With a great big smile she asked me , do you like them. I was really surprised , she looked good wearing glasses and I told her she looked great and asked her where did you get the glasses , you told me you did not need glasses.
Then she told me that when her sister got her new glasses, she had told Sandy to get rid of the old ones, they were not strong enough and she did not need them anymore.
Sandy was glad to have them , now she had her own glasses.
Sandy asked me if I would like to try wearing the glasses, I said yes I like to, I have never tried glasses and I would like to know what it feels like to wear glasses and what you see wearing them.
Sandy handed me the glasses and I carefully put them on. Looking through the lenses gave me a strange feeling at first , but the glasses were comfortable,and when I looked around the room everything looked brighter and more clear.
I walked to the window and looked outside and could not believe I saw things I had not noticed before, and how clear and bright everything looked.
Then I went to the mirror and was surprised how good I looked wearing glasses.
Sandy I cannot believe how much better and nicer everything  looks , do you think I need glasses?
I almost hat to take them off , everything looks so clear and nicer, but I guess I will have to, so I took the glasses off and handed the back to Sandy. and right away noticed that everything in the distance looked blurry.
Sandy put the glasses back on, and told me she had a little trouble seeing with them when she first put them on, but after wearing them for a little while and her eyes got used to she could see just fine.
Sandy told me that if everything looked better while  wearing the glasses, I most likely needed glasses , lucky me. 
I was not so sure about that.

That night I talked to my mother, and told her about Sandy and the glasses.  She asked me if I had any trouble seeing, and I told her I had not noticed ,until I tried the glasses and noticed everything clear and bright.
Mom I think I need my eyes examined and make sure, she agreed and would make an appointment for me.
I told Sandy my mother was going to make an appointment for me to get my eyes examined, I asked her what took place during an 
exam . She told me there was nothing to worry about and ti did not hurt.

My mother went with me to the optical store. We had to fill out a form and then I went in for my eye exam.
The lady doctor was very pleasant. Shone a light in my eyes and I was to follow the light. She asked me to read letters while I was looking trough what looked like oversize glasses, asked me which was better 1 or 2  and so on, it was a whole new experience.
When finished she told me my eyes were healthy, but I had myopia and some astigmatism and should wear glasses.
The doctor explained to my mother that vision deterioration usually was slow, and the patient does not realize it, and can only be spotted by regular eye exams.
She also told my mother that my prescription was a bit stronger than usual for a first time , and I should have yearly eye exams.
She than gave me the prescription to take to the optician.
With the help of my mother and the optician  we selected a half frame that I really liked
While they made my new glasses , we went to the Mall for lunch.
My mother was surprised that I needed glasses , she had not realized that regular eye exams were that important and told me that my brothers were going to have their eyes checked.
When we went to pick up my glasses and tried them on could not believe the improvement in my vision , everything was so bright and clear, I sure liked it.
My mother gave me a hug and told me how nice and grown up I looked wearing the glasses.
When I looked in the mirror was happy to see how nice the glasses looked on me.

When we came home  I gave Sandy a call and told her that I was wearing glasses now.
I will be right over , I want to see them
When she came , she looked at me and said you are lucky having to wear glasses and you look gorgeous.
She asked me if she could try my glasses. After she put them on said , wow these are stronger than my sisters old ones, now I can see why you need them, are you going to wear them all the time?
Yes I am going to wear them all the time, I can see so much better wearing them . The glasses are comfOrtable and I like the looks of them.
