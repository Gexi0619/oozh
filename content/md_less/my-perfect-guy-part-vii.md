“Michael, what do you mean you don’t have a spare pair? I have patients who have -1.5 diopters and they have a spare pair… How on earth is this possible?” Dr. S said
 
“I know Doc. I am desperate; I can’t see anything and my eyes and head hurt.” Mike said
 
“Mike your glasses aren’t gonna be ready in at least two weeks! Your prescription is by far the strongest one I’ve seen” Dr S said
 
“Doc. Can I talk to you real quick?” A young lady said and they both went out 

10 minutes later Dr. S came in with the lady and said
 
“Mike, Nicole, this is Melinda Stewart, she is a student at St. Halland University and has been practicing in multiple clinic studies and did a lot of research of similar strange cases of extreme myopia such as yours Michael, and she has information you might be interested to know” Dr. S said
 
“Yes, Michael right? I have seen a lot of extremely myopic patients who suffer similar eye conditions as the ones you do. Dr. S knows Dr. Ellen Mezz a well know fellow ophthalmologist from Spain who comes to the U.S. and performs surgeries in some patients. Your prescription seems to be ridiculously high and surgery wouldn’t correct your eyesight but would improve it” Melinda said
 
Mike was looking at nothing and nodding as if he could actually see Melinda, and the vacant look in his eyes was something I could watch all day long.
 
“But how? I’ve always been told I can’t have Lasik” Mike asked
 
“This is more like a lens replacement. To make it easier to understand imagine a small glass lens, that’s the implant we would install in your eye. The highest strength is about 25 diopters so you would still need a pretty high prescription but I’m sure your eyes would benefit from the surgery” Melinda answered
 
“What about the risks?” I asked


“Every surgical procedure comes with a risk, but that’s about the safest option for patients like Michael” Melinda said
 
“But what kind of risk? Is it safer than just sticking to his glasses?” I asked
 
“As I told you he would still need strong glasses, but probably his script would go from -36.5 and -38.50 to -11 or – 12 and of course the prism and cylinder correction as well. The risks go from having a retinal detachment to his body rejecting the lenses but that only has a 30% chance of happening” Melinda said
 
“Ok Melinda, thank you so much. I will discuss it with them and if they have any doubts I’ll let you know” Dr. S saind and politely asked her to leave 
 
Mike was there standing still, I couldn’t read his face; I didn’t know if he was mad or he was glad… 
 
“I needed you to listen to that option Mike, personally I don’t recommend you having the procedure. You’ve got a lot more to lose than to win.” Dr. S said “Nicole, I’m gonna ask you to do something for me. Can you please stand next to Mike?” 
 
“Of course” I said standing right by his side
 
“Can you take your glasses off please?” Dr. Said and I did “What can you see from there?” He asked
 
“Nothing, everything is extremely blurry. I can’t even make out shapes.” I answered
 
“Ok, I’m going to put a trial frame on you” He said and I could feel a very uncomfortable pair of glasses
 
“What can you see now?” He asked
 
“Uhmm things are a little bit less blurry but I still can’t make out shapes or anything, maybe I can distinguish more colors a little better but that’s about it” I said
 
“Do you think you could walk like this?” he asked
 
“Ohh absolutely not. I can’t see anything” I said
 
“Ok, that’s what a -12 prescription would look like. Still very blurry to function, still needing thick glasses. My recommendation is for you to go back to a healthy contacts routine. You over wore them so hard Mike that the healthiest option for you was to have them out of your life completely. But if you want to you can wear them for about 6 to 8 hours max every other day.” Dr S said
 
Mike was speechless and I could see he look sad, very sad. 
 
“Are there any other options Dr. S?” Mike asked
 
“The options are: Glasses, glasses and contacts or surgery and glasses. But consider the risks you’d be taking with a surgical procedure” Dr. S said. 
 
“What do you think Nikki? What should I do?” Mike asked
 
Of course I loved his glasses but I wanted him to feel better about himself too…
 
“I think you could go back to wearing contacts like Dr. S says, and maybe we could do some research on the procedures Melinda talks about to see how comfortable we are with them babe” I said
 
“How long would the contacts and glasses take Doc?” Mike asked
 
“Uhmm your full script has gone up, it reads:


O.D.  -36.5 / -4.75 170 / 3▲ Base In
O.S.   -38.5 / -3.75 010 / 2.5▲ Base in

So I could prescribe you some -25 contacts and probably with that you could be wearing the -12 glasses surgery would offer you, that way you can see how you feel. Let me make some calls and see if they have high prescription contacts in the lab right now” Dr. S said leaving the room
 
“Mike are you ok?” I asked
“I’m sick babe, I hate this. But having you here makes everything better. I’m glad to have someone who likes me for who I am” He said
 
5 minutes passed by and Dr. S came back and said
“Mike they do have a -25 pair of hard contacts, I’ll have them here in 20 minutes so we can get them fitted and test your eyesight with them on. If you want to go and eat something I’ll call you as soon as they arrive”

I grabbed Mikes arm and led him to the car, he was wearing a pair of sunglasses and he looked like a fully blind person. I drove to the nearest McDonalds and I repeated the process, I took Mikes hand and walked in 

“Step honey, be careful” I said
 
Going in it looked like we’d travel in time, I’ve never gone to that McDonalds and it was nothing like the other ones. This one was empty, it looked like everything was from the 80’s, even Ronald McDonald was there, half broken and looking creepier than ever. 

I ordered two Big Mac combos and went to sit Mike near a large window. I thought he could benefit from the light instead of being in the dim light the whole place had. 
 
I ate and Mike barely touched his fries.
 
“What’s wrong honey?” I asked
“Nothing, I’m just thinking babe” he said
“I think Dr. S is right babe, you should try the glasses and contacts combo and see how you feel” I said
“Yeah, I guess… I need to go to the bathroom. Can you tell me where to go?” He asked
“I can take you, wait” I said
“No, just tell me where it is” he said
“Ok, walk straight and go to the door on the right side” I said
I was watching him and he must have thought I meant the door on MY right cause he went to the woman’s bathroom. I saw the opportunity and I took it…
 
I went right behind him and said:
“What are you doing in the womans bathroom sir?” 
“What? You said your right Nikki” he answered
“No I didn’t but now you’re here I can help you feel a lot better” I said. I gave him a huge kiss and I dragged him inside a stool. 
My tongue explored his whole mouth and started going down his neck. 
“Nicole stop, we are at McDonalds” he said
“Shhhh, I’ll make you feel better baby” I made him lick my finger in and out to shush him up
I knew I couldn’t undress him or me here so I went with the easiest solution: I took his manhood in my hands and went down on my knees. I’m an expert in that department; I sucked the life out of Mike. He liked it and I knew it for the way he grabbed my head and pulled it so hard, I felt him in my throat and it was great. He knew he was almost there and most of the times he threw his load somewhere else but this time I took control and had him release himself on my face.
 
His whole face changed and I swear by the time we went back to the ophthalmologist he was in a better mood.
 
Dr. S helped him with the contacts and then he tested Mikes vision with them
 
“Michael with these combo your glasses prescription would read: 

O.D.  -10 / -4.75 170 / 3▲ Base In
O.S.   -12.5 / -3.75 010 / 2.5▲ Base in”
 
“Wow, I don’t remember when was the last time I had such a low script” Mike said
 
“Here, I’ll put a trial frame so you can walk around and tell me how it looks” Dr S said and placed the trial frame on Mikes face
 
“Wow!! It looks amazing, I haven’t seen this good in forever. I see a little bit funny tho, like a fishbowl effect” Mike said

“Well, the cylinder correction in addition to the already high prism and sphere you’ve got is what causes that effect but you’ll get used to it. If you like this combo I could have your glasses ready the day after tomorrow, but you can only wear them with the contacts for short periods. As soon as you get your full prescription glasses, you will only wear the combo every other day. Are we clear? Now let me see if I have strong glasses on the donation box. We might find something to help you” Dr. S said
 
“That’s amazing Doc, thank you so much!!” Mike answered happily. 
 
He then came back with a pair of glasses that had clearly been worn  a lot
 
“Here, this is the closest I could find. They are a -8 prescription but they will help. You will see double and not as clear but it’s definitely better than nothing” Dr. S said
 
Mike took the glasses and put them on “They do help, I still can’t see far, I can’t even make out my wife’s face but they’re ok I guess” 

(Wife? He called me his wife?!!!)
