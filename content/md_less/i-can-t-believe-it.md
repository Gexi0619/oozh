My name is Ashley, me and my husband Jeff, have an 11 year old daughter Megan and a 10 year old son Brandon.
We are a happy healthy family.
Our neighbor Jenny and her husband Mike, have a daughter Kelley and son Logan, who are the same age as our children. 

I went to see Jenny, on one of our regular visits for a cup of coffee.
When Jenny let me in, I was really surprised when I saw her wearing glasses.
My husband and I always thought her to be a beautiful women, but I thought she looked even more attractive wearing glasses
The lenses seemed to sparkle, and I loved the looks of her framed eyes behind the lenses.
I complimented her on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
When did you start to wear glasses?
Ashley, I started to wear glasses when I was in grade 4, but you have only seen me wearing my contact lenses.
Kelley is all upset, she had an eye exam to day, and has to wear glasses.
So to make her feel better about having to wear glasses, I have decided no more contact lenses,
and to wear my glasses full time.
We just came home from the optical store to pick up her glasses, and she is in her bedroom right now feeling sorry for herself.
I will ask her to come down.
When Kelley came into the room and I looked at her, saw a very pretty girl.
Kelley you look so nice wearing glasses, the frame color blends so nice with your hair, and I love 
how nice your eyes look behind the lenses.
Kelley came closer and thanked me, and said do you really think I look better wearing glasses.
I told her I did, and that I was sure a lot of kids would like to look as pretty as you do.
Jenny told me that myopia, a fancy word for being nearsighted, runs in her family, and she expects Logan will most likely need to wear glasses to, when he gets older.
We all go for regular eye exams, to make sure our vision is good.
After a long discussion about glasses, eye exams, and other problems, I went home knowing a little more about vision and glasses.

That night at supper I told the family about how nice Jenny looked wearing glasses, and that Kelley is  wearing glasses now.
My husband said I can t believe that Jenny looks even nicer when wearing glasses, I always thought that she was beautiful, I can t wait to see her, wearing her glasses.
Megan said Kelley told me she had a doctors appointment, I did not know she was going for an eye exam, how does she look wearing glasses? 
I thought she looked very nice.
I want to go and see her.
You can go and see her, but you have to be home by 8.

When Megan came home she was all excited, mom, Kelley looks fantastic wearing glasses.
I told Kelley how nice she looks wearing glasses, and she told me she thinks, that now she kind of likes her new look.
Mom, Kelley also let me try her glasses, they are great, I could see everything perfectly, when I was wearing them.
I really liked it how well I could see, everything looked so nice and clear, do you think I need to wear glasses?
When my husband asked me about it, I told him Megan was impressed with Kelley s glasses, and thinks she would like to wear glasses to, they are something new and different, just a kid s thing, it will go away. 
That was all that was said about glasses that night.

Saturday Jenny and I took the girls to the mall to do some shopping.
After we had made some purchases, it was time for refreshments.
At the food court I asked the girls what they would like.
Kelley looked at the menu board and told me what she wanted.
Megan looked, but did not tell me what she wanted.
When I asked her to make up her mind, she told me she had trouble seeing what was on the menu board.
Jenny who had been watching Megan squint, said to Kelley, give Megan you glasses for a minute.
When Megan put the glasses on and looked at the menu board,  told her mother right away what she wanted.
Jenny smiled, and I went to get the orders.
When I sat down and gave the girls their treats, I asked Kelley how she liked her glasses.
Well I can see so so much better now, and I am getting used to wearing them, and now like the way I look wearing glasses, yes I am glad to have them.,
Mom, I need to wear glasses, I had no trouble reading the menu board wearing Kelley s glasses.
Ashley, Megan is right, I noticed her squint trying to read the menu, and as soon as she put Kelley s glasses on, gave you her order, I think she is myopic just like Kelley. 
Jenny, are you sure, I thought Megan likes Kelley s glasses, because she wanted to be the same as Kelley and wear glasses to.
Ashley take her for an eye exam, and then you will know for sure.

When we came home, it was the first time my husband saw Jenny wear her glasses.
Judging by his reaction, he liked what he saw, and complimented both Jenny and Kelley how beautiful they looked wearing glasses.
That night, my husband told me a number of times how nice both Jenny and Kelley looked wearing glasses, and that he had never realized how wearing glasses could make a person look so much nicer.
He suggested that I should arrange to have eye exams for the children

Monday morning I went to see Jenny, to ask who she recommended for an eye exam.
Dr. Jones has looked after us and I think she is good, so she made the appointments for us for Wednesday afternoon..
When she told me she had made an appointment for me to, I asked her why?
Then you will know what an eye exam is like, in case the kids ask questions,  you will know what takes place.
I have noticed you squinting a number of times, there is always a chance your vision is not as good as you think it is.
Do you think I might need to wear glasses?
I don t know, that is why you go for an eye exam.
Going by your husbands reaction when he saw Kelley and me wearing glasses, he likes the looks of women wearing glasses.
If you need to wear glasses. I am sure he will love your new look.
Jenny what is it like to wear glasses?
First of all they make you see properly, and they change your appearance, but you will find glasses are really very easy to get used to.
I wonder how I will look wearing glasses?
Come with me Ashley, and you will find out.

We went to the optical store in the mall,.
Jenny made me try some frames that she thought would look good on me.
When I looked at myself, could not believe how the glasses changed my appearance, I think I might  like that look.
Ashley, you have a face to wear glasses, if you need to wear glasses, I am sure that your new look will drive your husband nuts.
Now I am a kind of looking forward to our eye exam, wondering what might happen.
I told my husband that I had booked eye exams for the children for Wednesday.

Jenny went with us when we went for our eye exams, so she could look after Megan and Brandon,
while I have my eye exam.
I went into the examination room with the children while they had their exam. 
Megan, as expected was myopic, and has to wear glasses, she is all excited, and with Jenny s help is selecting a frame while Brandon has his eye exam.
While the doctor was examining Brandon s eyes, she asked me if Brandon read a lot.
I told her that he hates reading, and prefers watching television.
Well Brandon is farsighted and has some astigmatism.
He needs to wear his glasses all the time, and I think he will soon be reading again.
After the exam, I mentioned to Jenny that Brandon also has to wear glasses.
I will look after him while you have your exam, and find him a nice frame that he will like.
Now it was my turn, after the Doctor had checked the health of my eyes, started the vision part.
When she asked, which is better, 1 or 2,  I realized I would be prescribed glasses. 
When finished the Doctor gave me my prescription, it read right ye â€“ 0.75 and the left eye -1.25.
Me, having to wear glasses, I can t believe it. 
Jenny looked at my prescription, well I am not surprised, welcome to the club, let s find you a nice frame.
I was sure glad Jenny had come with us, she had both Megan and Brandon happy with their frame selection, and their glasses were already in the lab to be made.
Megan and Jenny soon found the perfect frame for me, and after taking measurements we were told all the glasses would be ready in a couple of hours.

When I put my glasses on, could not believe the improvement in my vision. 
Megan told us, she now can see everything perfect. 
Brandon did not say very much, but he sure looks cute.
When we came home we decided that Megan show daddy her glasses first, than Logan, and I would be  last.
My poor husband, I thought he might have a heart attack.
He loved Megan s new look, told Brandon he looked fantastic.
When he saw me coming into the room wearing glasses was speechless.
Jenny was right about my husband s reaction.
That night I did not get a chance to take my glasses off, until after a fantastic love making session, my husband had fallen asleep.
I CAN T BELIEVE IT, three of us wearing glasses now, and a husband who loves our glasses look.
Life sure is full of surprises


PART 2

About 5 years later.

Jenny s husband is being transferred, and they have sold their house.
After the new neighbors had moved in, Megan and I went to visit them to introduce ourselves.  
A very pleasant girl, about Megan s age opened the door. 
Hello, I am Kim,. please come in, and meet the rest of the family.
We met Carol and her husband Jeff,  Andrew a boy about Brandon s age, and Kevin the oldest boy. 

Megan invited Kim to come over so they could get to know each other. 
They soon found out they both like a lot of the same things.
Kim told Megan, I had to leave my girl friend Katie, I loved that girl, I think you are the right friend for me.
We had a long conversation, and realized we both like to look our best, and off course make up.
Kim was more experienced with make up than Megan, and soon Megan s glasses came of to get the perfect eye make up for a person wearing glasses.
Kim said I read about it, and this is the first time I have a chance to do it, I love experimenting and see the results.
I sure like the way your eyes look now.
I had to agree, my eyes looked so nice and more defined behind the lenses.
This started the conversation about glasses.
Kim told me that nobody in her family wears glasses, I have always liked the look of glasses, and often wonder what is it like to wear glasses?
I love wearing my glasses, I have perfect vision, they are comfortable, and I like the way I look wearing glasses.
Kim wondered what she would look like wearing glasses.
Well here, you can try my glasses.
Yes, I like to try them.
Kim put the glasses on,  these are to strong for me, everything looks distorted.
Well I have all my old glasses, you can try them try them all. 
Kim tried them, and liked my second pair best, Megan I can t believe how well I can see wearing these glasses, how do I look?
After I told her how nice she looked, Kim had a look at herself, and just loved her new look.
After she applied the proper eye make up said,  I love the way I look wearing glasses, thank you for letting me try the glasses.
Still wearing the glasses, she walked over to me and gave me a hug.
Kim wore the glasses while we talked some more.
When I told her, if she wanted, she could keep the glasses, she pulled me close and gave me another hug, yes I would love to keep the glasses.
I have noticed that Kim loves to touch me when ever she can, I kind of like it, it gives you a nice feeling.

When Kim went home, she forgot all about wearing the glasses, and when she came home was shocked when she received so many questions and compliments,.
Her mother asked her about the glasses, and Kim told her that they are Megan s old glasses, and I can see everything perfect when wearing the glasses.
Well if you can see properly, and like wearing them, wear them, you look very nice wearing glasses. 
Later when all the rest of the family had seen her wearing glasses and all had complimented her, Kim decided she would keep wearing the glasses, she loved her new look.

Andrew and Logan soon became friends
Logan asked Andrew about his hearing aids.
I have had a hearing problem most of my life, they are no trouble, and I can hear just fine.
Logan how long have you been wearing glasses? 
Do you like wearing them?
I started to wear glasses about 5 years ago, they are no problem to wear.  
I can see well, and now like the way I look wearing glasses.
Can I try your glasses?
Sure, here try them.
After Andrew put the glasses on, first thing he said was, I love the sexy feeling I get
wearing the glasses, if I could see better when wearing them, would not give them back to you.
If wearing glasses feels that good, I think I would like to wear glasses.

Later when Megan told the family about Kim, the make up, and wearing her old glasses now, Logan knew what to do when Andrew came again.

The next time Andrew came to see Logan, he was in for a surprise.
Logan opened his dresser drawer, and there were three glasses cases,.
Andrew help your self, here are some glasses for you to try.
All excited Andrew tried them all, then put on the pair he liked best
Logan look at my pants, see that big bulge, that is what wearing the glasses does to me.
You know what to do about that, or do you want me to help you.
Yes, help me, and the boys had a good time wearing glasses and playing with each other. 

After Andrew came home and told his mother how he liked wearing Logan s old glasses, his mother 
decided to arrange an eye appointment for all he children.
She asked Ashley about an eye doctor, Ashley gave her the Doctor s name, and suggested she should have an eye exam to, that is the only way to find out how good your vision is. 

When Carol and her family had their eye exams.
Andrew, has to wear glasses for hyperopia and some astigmatism, he is happy,  he now has his own glasses. 
Kim is myopic and loves her new -1.75 glasses.
Kevin is a low myopic and told to wear his glasses for driving at night.
Carol was prescribed reading glasses.

Kim came over to show me her new glasses, she looks fantastic.
While we tried each others glasses, we ended up in an embrace, and Kim started to kiss me.
Megan, thank you, if it was not for you, I would not be wearing these glasses.
I liked the kiss, so I kissed her back.
I love the sexy feeling I get kissing, while wearing our glasses.
After we broke the kiss Kim told me, that everybody in her family is wearing glasses now.  

That night I told my mother that everyone in Kim s family is wearing glasses now
Mother said, I can t believe it, when Kelley started to wear glasses and you tried them,
we all ended up wearing glasses.
Kim tried your glasses and realizes she can see so much better, and wears your glasses, and now their whole family is wearing glasses.
I CAN T BELIEVE IT.
Life sure is full of surprises.

Part 3

I have graduated from high school.
Kim and I are still friends, and I am happy for her she has found a friend that fits her life style.
They both are very happy.
I have had quite a few dates, but have not found Mr Perfect yet.

 Sunday while in church, I noticed a very handsome, glasses wearing guy.
 I sure like to get to know him, he looks like my kind of guy.
After church my parents met some friends, and we had a little chat.
They also introduced us to their new neighbors and their son Matthew.
I almost flipped, that handsome glasses wearing guy.
Matthew shook hands with me, hello Megan, glad to meet you.
We had a pleasant conversation and told me they had just moved into town.
He asked me if I would like to be his guide this afternoon, and show him around town.
I told him I would I love to show him the sights.
After I told him where I live, he told me to expect him at about 2 o clock.
We had a great afternoon, I sure like that guy.

I have had quite a few dates with Mathew, a very handsome, I really love him.
Matthew s father is the owner of the optical store in the mall.
Mathew is studying to become an optometrist, and he suggested, I should think about becoming an optician.
If you take the course to become an optician, we will be graduating in the same year, and be able to work together.
I love the idea that Matthew is thinking that far ahead, and I am all for it..
Next thing, Matthew had arranged for me to have a summer job at the optical store. 

I really enjoy working at the optical store and looking forward to start the course to become an optician.
Before going to college I had another eye exam.
My dad told me that my new glasses with the minus four prescription look fantastic.

Time goes fast.
I now am a licensed optician, Mark my husband an optometrist, and I am pregnant.
Living in our new house, we had our parents over for dinner.
