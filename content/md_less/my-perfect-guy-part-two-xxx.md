Hi, this story has sexual content.

I took in consideration the comments "glassesforeveryone", "Bobby" and "Soundmanpt" did to "My perfect guy PART ONE" and I wrote part TWO a few minutes ago. Thank you so much for your feedback, it helps me a lot. Hope you enjoy!

...........................................................................................................................................



I woke up hugging Mike, I had never seen such a beautiful face before. Who would ever know that this great looking guy could be so self conscious and insecure about a pair of glasses? 
I didn’t want to wake him up so I slowly got up and went to the bathroom, when I came back I saw his glasses next to my pillow. I had left them there yesterday and a rush of feelings came back to me when I pictured him waking up and managing to find his way to his contacts  without them. I grabbed the glasses and they mesmerized me so I examined them carefully, I’ve never seen such a strong prescription, even the way the lenses looked was new to me. They weren’t as thick as Alex’s glasses, but these ones had small circles in them and when Mike was wearing them, his eyes were so tiny I could barely see them, and I wasn’t waste my opportunity to try them on, so I did. 

“MY GOD IS MY MIKE BLIND” I thought, I couldn’t see anything through them, I couldn’t even make out shapes and colors were not there anymore, sure I could see light, but I couldn’t see anything else and I felt my eyes were about to pop out of their sockets so I took them off. 
I guess I never realized how bad Mikes vision is, when I tried Alex’s glasses I couldn’t see but I could pass 30 seconds with them and with Mike’s glasses I just couldn’t. So I placed them next to my pillow again and went to see if I could find something to make breakfast for the both of us since I was starving and I knew Mike would probably be too when he woke up. 

“Nikki?!,” Mike said

“Yes honey, give me a minute,” was my reply. Perhaps it was odd for me to call him honey after only a few kisses and one night together, but I didn’t care. I knew I was in love.

I was pouring some pancake flour into a bowl when I remembered about the glasses and that he probably couldn’t see them since the bed sheets were dark brown and the glasses were too, so I ran to the bedroom but stood still when I saw him naked and groping around his side of the bed looking for his glasses. He turned his head to were I was standing and I’m sure he couldn’t even see I was standing there. Enough is enough, I suddenly felt so bad for enjoying seeing Mike like that so I went and grabbed his glasses and said “Here honey, I’ve got them for you”. I could see his face turning bright red as he thanked me. 

“Thank you good looking, I see you found a pair of shorts to wear. I don’t think Franks’s clothes are gonna fit into me, he is way to thin but I’ll get dressed and I’ll be right with you,” said Mike.

“Ok, I’m cooking some pancakes, hope you like them. I’ll go to the grocery store so Frank won’t notice we ate his food”.

“Don’t worry, feel free to take anything you need” he said

“Ok, thank you… Mike, can I ask you a favor?”

“Sure babe, whatever you want,” he replied

“Could you please wear your glasses today instead of your contacts? at least while we are here. I want you to be comfortable and I know your contacts bother you, besides I wan’t you to realize I don’t mind if you wear glasses,” I answered

“It’s a little bit weird that you are asking that Nicole, but sure I can do it”

“Thank you honey,” I said while walking back to the kitchen.


When Mike came the table was already set.

“This looks great!, I’m starving,” he said and proceeded to give me a kiss 

We sat down next to each other and I tried not to be so obvious but I couldn’t stop taring at him.


“Is everything ok?,” Mike said

“It is, better than ever don’t you think?,” I said

“Look Nikki, I like you so much, but you don’t have to pretend you like me in glasses. I don’t mind really, I don’t even like myself when I’m wearing them,” Mike responded 

“Pretend? Come on Mike you know me better than that. I do like you, and to be honest I’ve never seen glasses like yours, but I don’t think you look bad at all,” I assured him

“I look awful, I hate to be this blind, this has always been an issue for me, but I rather tell you everything about it so you are aware before you kiss me again. My eyesight is terrible, I’ve never met someone with glasses as thick as mine. If I wear my contacts I’m fine, I do have problems seeing things like everybody else, but I can manage and I can use reading glasses to see small print, but with my glasses everything changes. I can’t see that well wearing them, I can’t read unless I pull them down, I have no peripheral vision at all… And I spoke to my ophthalmologist and she told me I could never get surgery to solve my problems. My prescription is -27 for my right eye and -29 for my left one, and thats in contacts, in glasses I don’t even know anymore but something around -34 and -36.”

Those numbers meant nothing to me, but it sure sounded strong. I’ve never had any experience with glasses, I only saw Alex wearing hers and that was it, but Mikes vision aroused me and I couldn’t do anything to help it.

“Mike you could wear -1000 and I wouldn’t mind, I like you for who you are, not for what you see,” I did like him for who he was, but I felt aroused just by looking at his tiny eyes blinking behind those glasses.

“Are you sure Nikki?, you don’t have to say that just to make me feel good. I’d totally understand if you wanted to leave things here”

So I stood up and asked him to stand up, he did, so I gave him a hug and kissed him hard. I could feel his glasses on my cheeks and sometimes on my forehead. They felt so good, I was so hot by then, that I took my own shirt off and pulled his hands on my breasts, he caressed them so good. I unbuttoned his pants and I started massaging his boxers, I could feel he was as hard as he was yesterday. I went on my knees and gave him a blow job, as good as the one I gave him last night. Again he took his glasses off, I guess he didn’t feel comfortable wearing them while being intimate. I stood up and asked him to go into me. I saw him having a hard time finding his way to my intimate part so I led him. I was so aroused with his unfocused and blindly look that I wast about to burst the minute I felt him inside but I held it. His face came close to mine with the intentions of giving me a kiss but his lips were nowhere near mine. This had me flying. Mike couldn’t even see where my boobs were to kiss them without having to find his was to them with his hands…. We had the most amazing morning sex right there on Franks kitchen.

To be continued…
