We both  wear glasses now.

My name is  Kevin .
I am   the youngest  in the family , and have to do some of the chores around the farm.
 Most of the time my  job is to  bring the cows in  from the field at milking time.
I always have to ask  which field they are in, so I know where they are  and easier to find,, 

I go to High school, it is about a half hour ride on the school bus and  I always sit beside my friend 
Jeff, we have been friends since grade 1 .
To day when I got on the bus, I could not believe it , Jeff was wearing glasses.
I sat down beside him and told him how cool he looked wearing glasses.
You did not tell me you were getting glasses, what happened ?
Well my mother thought I did a lot of squinting, and since my older  sister started to wear glasses a couple of years  ago, she became an expert , and thought I needed an eye exam.
What is it like to wear glasses ?
Well I can see so much better now and they are comfortable to wear.
You see that sign , I can read all the words,
I don t believe it, the sign is all blurry.
Here try my glasses and see.
I put the glasses on ,  looked at the sign , and had no trouble reading the letters.
I can t believe it , everything is so nice and clear.
Perhaps you  need glasses to.
Well if I can see that well when  wearing them, I don t mind.
I  sure like the feel of the glasses on my face ,  they give me a nice feeling , a kind of sexy like.
 Jeff said yes, I found them that way to , they  kind of  turn me on.
Now can I have my glasses back ?
Hesitantly I took them  off and handed  Jeff his glasses .
I  now wanted to wear glasses , and be able to see so much better and I loved  the way the glasses made me feel.

When I came home that night . I told my parents about Jeff s glasses .
My dad told me that I was the youngest in the family, and nobody else  in the family needed to wear glasses , so I better forget about glasses I did not need them..

I usually spend some time every weekend with Jeff.
 We would  jump on our bikes and go and see each other.
So on Saturday , I jumped on my bike and went to see Jeff.
I asked him if I could try his glasses again.
Jeff handed me the glasses and  when I put them on  , got that wonderful feeling again.
I excused myself and went to the bathroom to pleasure myself.
When I came back into the room , Jeff laughed and told me , that  wearing the glasses did the same to him.

The following weekend ,   when I went to see Jeff,  I was looking forward to wear his glasses again, and  having that great feeling,
  When I got to his place , he surprised me , when he told me he had a present for me.
 Here you are ,  a pair of glasses for you, they are my sisters old glasses , you can wear them when you are here.
Wow that is great.
When I put the glasses on relized they were about the same prescription as Jeff s. 
I could see so well when wearing them , I loved it.
Off course I started to feel sexy again, Jeff laughed, and said I see you have a big bulge in your pants again.
I admitted that  wearing the glasses did  that to me, and looking at him wearing glasses made it worse.
Jeff moved closer and laid his hand on my bulge .
When he did that I could not help myself and grabbed a hold of his  big bulge.
Not long after, when  we were both satisfied  it was getting time for me to go home.
I hated to take the glasses off , and when I did everything in the distance was fuzzy again.
When I got home to round up the cows to be milked , I realized the trouble I had finding them   was  because of my poor eyesight

A couple of months later , in school ,we had driver education, and after the written  test , we had our vision test.
I could not read any of the letters and was told to get myself a pair of glasses and then  come back.
At home that night my mother told me she would make an appointment for me to have  an eye exam. 
I knew I had to wear glasses , and was not surprised when the optometrist told me I was myopic and had to wear glasses.

 On Saturday morning when my new  glasses were ready and I put them on,  I could see so well, it was fantastic.
The black frame I had slected  with  my -2.00 prescription made my eyes look so nice .
 I loved my new look ,the frame was so comfortable to wear , I felt great.
After I came home , I jumped on my bike and went to see Jeff and show him my new glasses.
When I entered Jeff s bedroom and he saw me said , you look fantastic , 
He had to try my glasses and realizaed my prescription was a little stronger than his.
When I put my glasses back on , Jeff said come here I feel like hugging  you you look so beautiful .
When he hugged me I could not help myself and  kissed him.
Jeff kissed me back, and before we knew it we were feeling  each other  and enjoyed our orgasm.
We now are  closer friends than ever  ,and when we are together, always  have a wonderful time. 

By the time  I finished high school, my glasses prescription was – 3.75 for  the right and – 3.50 for the left eye, and some astigmatism.
Both Jeff and I loved the look of my new glasses 
Jeff s prescription had only inceased one diopter on both eyes and  he looked fantastic wearing his new glasses.

We both went to the same college and so  were able to share a room.
It did not take long for us to be known as a couple.
We met some of the other couples ,and when we went  to L.B.G.T. meetings.
Our parents did  not know our relationship, and we were not in a hurry to let them know.

After graduating we  were fortunate , we  found employment in the same town.
We rented a nice apartment and lived like a married couple , and loved every minute of it.
We were not ready to come out of the closet yet , both of our parents were kind of old fashioned, and we did not know what to expect.
Jeff s  older sister came visit , and  wanted to stay for a couple of days.
She had not realized we were living together and  soon figured out that we were a couple.
Jeff told  his sister that he loved me and we were going to stay together.
Jeff s sister told us she understood and that she would talk to our parents and try to make them understand .
It would make it a little easier for us to come out of the closet 
It took a long time for our parents to invite us to come home 
When we came home they told us they would accept our wishes , and in the future not forget where home is.
