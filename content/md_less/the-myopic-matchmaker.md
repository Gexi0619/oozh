I slowed the school bus and applied the orange flashing warning lights to indicate to the cars behind that I was slowing to pick up a student.  As I drew closer and was about to stop I activated the red stop lights, and brought the bus to a complete halt. My new route map had indicated there was a student pickup at this point and a young lady of about 12 or 13 was waiting at the side of the road for me. She came to the open door and as she walked up the steps into the bus I couldn’t help but notice that she was wearing what was likely the strongest pair of minus glasses I had ever seen. They were myodisc lenses set in a fairly small frame size, and I could tell from the reflections that the front of the myodisc lens also contained some of the prescription.  She looked at me and I think she could tell that I was staring at her, so she returned my stare as if to say, “I know they are thick, so just go ahead and get a good look.” I was speechless for a second, but managed to say, “I like your glasses,” as she walked to her seat. I went on to pick up the kids on my route and arrived at the school by 8:30. As she got off the bus and walked past me she spoke.
 
“You like them, but you don’t have to wear them. I have to wear them, but I don’t like them.”
 
I thought of this young lady for the rest of the day.  I was only driving school bus because I had recently been laid off from my job as a financial planner and my spare time between the morning run and the afternoon run was allowing me time to study for another job.  I had completed high school and had taken 3 years of university, but after 5 years of work I had realized that at age 29 I hated my job and needed to get into a field where I could do something that I really enjoyed.  I wanted to become an optometrist, but I wasn’t sure I could afford to take the time required to take another few years of schooling to do this. So the next best thing for me was to become an optician.  Opticians were in demand at the moment, and the wages were fairly good.  But the main thing was that the job of optician would put me in close contact with people who wore glasses and this had always been of great interest to me.
 
I was looking forward to seeing the young, very nearsighted girl again, and I was not disappointed when she was one of the first to get on the bus. She sat in the seat behind me, and the huge mirror that was there for the driver to watch for unruly students gave me a very good view of her. In my mind I had nicknamed her specs, but I knew I could never call her that. If she complained I could lose my job.
 
I had dropped off all of the other kids and when I reached the place where I had picked her up I noticed that the shoulder was wide enough to pull the bus off so I didn’t hold up any traffic.
 
“I wasn’t being sarcastic when I told you this morning that I liked your glasses. I can tell that they are very strong, but they actually look quite nice on you.  I am studying to become an optician and I know that your optician did a very good job.” I said.
 
“You think my glasses are strong, you should see my mothers.”
 
“Are hers stronger than yours?” I asked.
 
“A lot.”
 
“I can’t call you what I nicknamed you. Will you tell me your name?”
 
“It is Alyssa.  What did you nickname me – 4 eyes?”
 
“No, I really shouldn’t tell you, but in my mind I was calling you Specs.” 
 
“Well, that is better than 4 eyes. Everyone else calls me that.”
 
“Let me walk you across the road. I know it isn’t very busy here, but I really should have stopped on the road with my red flashing stop lights on. I just wanted to talk with you for a minute.” I said.
 
“Can you leave the bus here for a few minutes?  You can walk me to the house and meet my mom.” Alyssa replied.
 
“If your mom is single and is as pretty as you are I would love to do that.” I told her.
 
“Yes to both.” Alyssa stated.
 
I walked Alyssa down the short driveway to a pretty little cottage type of house. She opened the front door and invited me in as she called for her mom.
 
When Alyssa’s mother walked into the room my mouth dropped and you could have knocked me over with a feather. She was a drop dead gorgeous lady, even though her well-worn jeans and t shirt were paint splattered.  The t shirt was tight on her and her breasts likely looked bigger than they really were, but my interest was captivated by the wonderful glasses she had on her perfect face.  The frame was contemporary, and a little larger size than I would have selected for a lady with very high myopia.  But the lenses were biconcave myodisc with quite a small circle. The outer circle was likely 22mm, and the inner circle looked to be around 20mm. This was one really powerful pair of glasses.
 
Alyssa introduced me to her mom, who was named Mandy. She embarrassed me a little when she told her mom that I had told her I liked her glasses and that she then told me I would like her mom’s even more.
 
“Oh. Are you another glasses guy?” Mandy asked.
 
“I am not sure what you mean by that Mandy. I find women who wear glasses very attractive, but I have to be attracted to the face behind the glasses as well.  I am studying to become an optician, and I have to tell you one of the main reasons I am doing that is because I do have an interest in glasses.” I said.
 
“Alyssa’s dad loved me wearing my glasses when we got married.  But somewhere along the line he changed his mind and he ended up leaving us.  I just got my final divorce papers before we moved here.” Mandy replied.
 
“Your prescription is exceptionally strong. Do you mind me asking how strong it is?” I asked.
 
“It is no secret.  These glasses are -48.00D in both eyes. Alyssa is right at -28D now, but she will probably end up with a prescription similar to mine when she gets older. The doctors think we have a very mild case of a hereditary disease called Sticklers Syndrome, but we are very fortunate in that the only part of this disease that has shown up in our family is that all the women are highly myopic.  This disease can manifest itself in many ways and it often attacks the soft muscle tissue in other parts of the body, but we have no signs of it attacking anything but our eyes and making the eyeball elongate.” Mandy said
 
“I see you have a car outside. Do you drive, or is that someone else’s car?” I asked.
 
“I drive, but not at night. My vision in daylight is a little better than the 20/40 minimum that is required. Mandy replied.
 
“Would you and Alyssa like to go to the fall fair with me on Saturday?” I asked.
 
“We would love to, wouldn’t we Alyssa.” Mandy stated
 
“You promised to take me anyway mom.” Alyssa said.
 
“It’s a date then. I will pick you up at 9 on Saturday morning.” I told them.
 
Saturday morning I washed my car and vacuumed and cleaned out the inside before I went to pick up Mandy and Alyssa.  They were ready on time and because it was a nice bright sunny day they were both wearing prescription sunglasses.  We all had a great time at the fair and Alyssa really liked it when I went on some of the rides with her.  Mandy had strapped Alyssa’s glasses to her head so they wouldn’t come off and this way Alyssa was able to enjoy herself.
 
While I was alone on the rides with Alyssa I asked her a few questions about her dad.  Apparently he didn’t just leave them. Mandy gave him the boot after he had an affair with a girl that he worked with.  He didn’t want to leave, but Mandy was no longer interested in having him around. Apparently when Alyssa tried, with the urging of her dad, to talk Mandy into giving him another chance, Mandy simply told her that a skunk cannot change the color of their stripe.  I knew then that this was one tough lady and if I wanted to get anywhere with her I had better be very honest and open in our relationship.
 
We had a fun day. Mandy got some cotton candy on one lens of her glasses, but it did not affect the myodisc part that she looked through and she refused to take her glasses off to allow me clean them.  Finally as the sun dropped behind the horizon Alyssa allowed me to take them home.  Once in the safe environment of their home Mandy sat on the couch next to me and Alyssa took her glasses to the kitchen where she washed the lenses with dish soap and water. Then she dried them on a soft cotton cloth that looked to be kept handy just for that purpose and then brought her mom back her glasses.  Mandy looked extremely pretty without her glasses, but after only knowing her for a day I felt that there was something missing from her face, and when the glasses were back on I knew that they were just what was needed to make her even more beautiful to me.
 
I went to the bedroom with Mandy when she went in to kiss Alyssa goodnight.  Alyssa had on a different pair of glasses, but she didn’t take them off, not even when the light went out. When Mandy and I were back in the living room I asked Mandy if Alyssa wore her glasses to sleep in, and Mandy told me they both did.  Apparently they had special glasses with titanium frames for sleeping in that were pretty much indestructible and would return to their shape if they were ever twisted or bent.  And while the lenses were plastic and were a little thicker than the special high index glass ones that both Alyssa and Mandy wore in their daily wear glasses they were less likely to break if dropped.
 
“Would the fact that I need to wear my glasses in bed bother you Evan?” Mandy asked.
 
‘I don’t think so.  We could try it out to see.” I suggested.
 
“Not so fast buddy. I just got rid of one asshole of a husband and I don’t feel like taking on another one without getting to know you better first.” Mandy replied.
 
“I can sleep with a girl without having sex you know.” I replied.
 
“Well maybe I can’t sleep with a man without wanting it.” Mandy said.
 
“I like you a lot already Mandy, so I am willing to let you set the agenda.” I answered.
 
“Good answer Evan. I like you a lot also.” Mandy replied.
 
Mandy showed me what she did for a living. Apparently, for a lady with such poor eyesight, she was an accomplished landscape artist, as well as a top notch photographer.  I didn’t want to cast aspersions on her vision, but I did question her as to how she could possibly do such fantastic work when her eyesight was so poor. She did not seem to be upset by my question, and she told me that she felt that by looking at the world through her very strong minus lenses she was able to use this view to her benefit in her painting. And her minified view of the world seemed to give her a better idea of what her photo’s would turn out like. After seeing her work I could tell that her severe myopia did not handicap her in any way.
 
I had noticed when she took her glasses off and handed them to Alyssa to clean them for her that there seemed to be a tab on the end of each of the temples. I was curious about that, so I asked Mandy about them. She took her glasses off to show me the little silicone grips that went behind her ears to hold her glasses in place, but she first had to tell me that I was the only person, except for possibly her ex, that had ever seen her without her glasses twice in one day. Apparently, with such a strong prescription as she and Alyssa had, their glasses needed to be in the perfect position from their cornea to give them the best possible correction.  They were what opticians call millimeter jobs, as even the smallest movement in the positioning of their glasses could make a huge difference in what their visual acuity was.  Mandy explained that when she was younger she had mostly worn glasses with cable temples, but now cable temples were almost impossible to find on any of the new frames so the little silicone tabs were the next best thing.
 
It was midnight, and we were still sitting on the couch talking, with Mandy lying curled up and her head on my lap. She looked into my eyes, and although her own eyes were just tiny pinpricks behind her extremely strong myodiscs I thought I could detect a twinkle in them.
 
“I’m either going to have to kick you out so I can go to bed, or I am going to have to ask you to share my bed with me.  I don’t know just what to do.” Mandy said.
 
“Up to you girl.  I do promise to love you til the end of time, and I won’t be praying for the end of time.” I said with a reference to that old Meatloaf song.
 
Mandy laughed, and she sat up. Then she stood up and led me to her bedroom.  She had a king bed in there, and she told me that she slept on the right side.  There was a pair of glasses sitting on her bedside table, and she sat on the bed and changed to those glasses before we undressed and went naked into the on suite bathroom.  We got into the shower together, and I gently washed her back. Then I turned her around and looked her in the eyes as I washed her breasts and then went down to her vagina.  She reciprocated by washing my back and when I turned around to let the water rinse off the soap she washed my chest and then went down to my penis, which was now rock hard after her fondling it. After we finished rinsing we got out and I towel dried Mandy before she dried me off.  When we got into the bed I held her in my arms, and we cuddled for a while.  I wanted to have intercourse with Mandy so badly my whole body ached, but we fell asleep in each other’s arms first.
 
When morning came I woke up first and I watched Mandy sleeping for a while.  I had only known this lady for less than a week and already I could tell that she was the perfect one for me. Finally her eyes blinked open behind the lenses of her glasses and I could tell she was staring at me.
 
“You are staring. Do you like what you see?” I asked.
 
“I am only doing what you have been doing since you woke up. And, yes, I like what I see. I also like the fact that you did not pressure me to have sex with you last night.” Mandy replied.
 
“Were you awake already? How did you know I have been watching you?” I asked.
 
‘That was just a good guess on my part.  Did you like what you saw?” Mandy asked.
 
“Do you believe in love at first sight?” I questioned.
 
“You didn’t answer my question. Do you like what you see?” Mandy asked again.
 
“I like what I see very much.  I am thinking I would love to wake up with you in my arms every morning for the next hundred years.  You are so beautiful that you take my breath away every time I look at you.” I replied.
 
“Good answer.  And yes, I do believe in love at first sight. I was attracted to you the minute I saw you. It seems that my poor eyesight does not bother you then.  I would like to have a couple more kids. How do you feel about the probability that if we have children any boys might be carriers of high myopia and any girls will likely be extremely nearsighted.  Also if the Sticklers manifests itself in any of the more serious ways they could have glaucoma, or retinal detachments, or a cleft palate or even a crooked spine.  Severe myopia is nothing compared to what it could be.” Mandy said.
 
“I guess we will just have to cross that bridge when we get there.” I answered.
 
Mandy and I got started making babies that very morning.  A little over a month later we stood in front of a justice of the peace and exchanged our vows, with Alyssa as her mother’s maid of honor. As we walked out of the JP’s office I caught Alyssa staring at me through the thick lenses of her strong glasses the same way she did that first morning on the bus.  This time her stare said to me that she was saying, “See, I knew you would be perfect for my mom.”
 
I love that little myopic matchmaker almost as much as I love her mom.
