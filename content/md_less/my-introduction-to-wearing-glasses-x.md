My introduction to wearing glasses [x]




Today, during out physics class, the subject, was light, and lenses.
What an interesting subject, we discussed the use of lenses for microscopes, binoculars, and eyeglasses.
Now I am curious to find out more, about about the use of lenses for vision and glasses,.
I am not familiar with glasses, my dad is using reading glasses, and now I know they magnify.
the other type of lenses are used in eyeglasses, I would like to know more about them, and try them, I have two girl friends and neither of them wears glasses.
I spend some time to read about lenses and glasses, using my computer
How do I find out what it is like to look through lenses? I sure like to find out,
Now I am looking at all the students who wear glasses, trying to figure out the type of lens they are looking through, I also notice now that most look very nice wearing glasses, now I wonder what is it like to wear glasses, and would I like to wear them?.


To day a new girl came into our class,
When I talked to her she told me they just moved here, she is as very pleasant person and easy to talk to, I liked her very much, so I asked her to have lunch with me.
Carolyn, is as beautiful as she is pleasant.
She has nice big brown eyes, gorgeous dark blond hair, and a nice bust line and figure, we really connected.
The next couple of days at school, we enjoyed each others company, and she invited me to her home, for a visit the next Saturday,
When I arrived at Carolyn's home, and she opened the door, I could not believe my eyes, Carolyn was wearing glasses, she looked fantastic.
The glasses she was wearing, looked to me like a strong prescription.
When we were in her bedroom, I told her, that she looked fantastic wearing glasses, why don't you wear your glasses at school
She thanked me for the compliment, and told me she loves wearing her glasses, but her mother insists, that she wears her contact lenses, when not at home, she wants me to look, the perfect healthy girl.
I started to wear glasses in grade 3, and has been wearing contact lenses since then, I don't think my aunts and uncles, even know I wear glasses. 
I told her, that now I have become fascinated about glasses, and wonder how it feels to wear glasses, and how wearing glasses can improve your vision.
Emily, try my glasses, I don't think you can see well wearing them, but you find out how it feels wearing glasses.
I put the glasses on, and was surprised how nice they felt on my face, but Carolyn was right, I could not see to well.
Emily, you look real nice wearing glasses, I had to put on my last pair of glasses, so I could have a good look at you.
I knew, you would not be able to see much, but it gave you an idea how it feels to have glasses on your face, the prescription of the glasses is minus 7.50. 
Carolyn, thank you, now I have some idea how it feels to wear glasses, looking through lenses will have to come some other time.
I am sorry to say, I have perfect vision, and don't need glasses,
I disagree, I have noticed you squinting, and keeping your books close to to your eyes when reading, which are signs, you might be myopic.
Come to the window, can you read the house numbers across the street?
I cannot, they are to far away.
Well I can, and I will show that you can to.
Emily, I will give you the experience of looking through lenses, and she went to her dresser and pulled out a box full of glasses.


Here are all the glasses I wore over the years, and all the cases have their prescription in it.
Start with my first pair. I know they are too small for you to wear, but looking through the lenses, will give you some idea, what you see lookingi through lenses
I was surprised that every time I looked through a different pair, my vision improved.
When I tried her third pair the frame was large enough so that I could wear them.
I walked to the window and I could not believe it, I could see the house numbers across the street, but not read them.
Here try my next pair, and when I put them on, could read all the house numbers.
Carolyn, I can't believe it, that glasses can help you like that.
Emily, I am sure you are myopic, the prescription of these glasses is, OD -1.75, and OS-2.00.
I enjoyed wearing the glasses, and my improved vision so much, I did not want to take the glasses off.
Carolyn, I think you are right, I must be myopic, all I now need is an eye exam and my own glasses.
What will I look like wearing glasses? 
You will look great, and I have an idea, let's go to the optical store in the mall, and try all the different frames, so you can see for yourself, what you will look like wearing glasses.
Carolyn, I love you, and gave her a big hug, you are the best friend I ever had.
The glasses I was wearing, looked not to bad, and I did not take them off, because, I enjoyed my improved vision, and loved the feel of them on my face, and wore them when we went to the optical store, we had a ball, trying all the different frames.
Now I realize I need glasses, and I can look good, now I am really looking forward to get my own.
When I came home, I told my mother, that I thought, I should have an eye exam.
Why? Well I have a problem, seeing objects in the distance
I cannot believe it, none of your older brothers have a vision problem, but if you are sure, you can make an appointment, you can use your health card for the exam, and you have your own credit card now, in case you have to buy glasses.
I made an appointment, for a day next week after school, I am really looking forward to the new experience, of an eye exam.


I started to wear the glasses when at school, and really enjoyed my improved vision.
On the day of my eye exam, Carolyn insisted she go with me, so we went together, I was still wearing my glasses when we arrived at the optical store, I was looked after right away. 
The optician took my glasses, and seated me in the examination room, where the Doctor greeted me and started the exam.
I enjoyed the exam, and when finished the doctor told me there was only a small change in my prescription, a 1/2 diopter increase for both eyes, and a small correction in my astigmatism. 
When I walked into the store carrying my prescription. 
Carolyn wanted to see it, well Emily for somebody who told me she had perfect vision, it sure is a high, for a first prescription. 
It did not take long to select a frame, and because there was a 2 for 1 sale, I got one frame that Carolyn liked best, and the other one, was my first choice, and the glasses would be ready the next day,


I was so excited, when I went to get my glasses, I sat down at the little desk and the optician handed me my glasses, when I put them on and looked around I was thrilled my vision was perfect, and looking at myself loved my new look, after adjusting both pairs of glasses, I was ready to go home.
My mother still thinks it is a shame, for me having to wear glasses, told me I looked all right,
but she is not happy.


The next day at school, I received many compliment, and two guys asked me for a date, I thanked them, and told them, that I was spoken for.
Carolyn told me I had never looked this good, I thanked her and we made arrangements getting together again on the weekend.


When I arrived at Carolyn's place, her mother commented how nice I looked wearing glasses, but that it was to bad that I have to wear them.
Well I love wearing glasses, and I think Carolyn should wear her glasses all the time, she looks so nice wearing them, and more students are wearing glasses now.
Yes, I noticed, and since Carolyn has problems lately, with her contact lenses, I think you may be right, she perhaps should be wearing her glasses all the time.
Carolyn was so happy, and thanked me with a big hug.
When Carolyn wore her glasses to school, she was so happy, to be able to wear her glasses now whenever she wanted. 
A few guys asked her for a date, but she just thanked them, she is like I am, and does not care for boys to much.


We now have graduated and after the summer break, are going to university, and study hard to to be optometrists. 
We both have summer job, to make some extra spending money.
I now have a glasses fetish, and like to wear all of Carolyn's older glasses, I love the looks of stronger lenses that show some depth, and I am glad Carolyn likes the looks of strong lenses to.
We sure are two of a kind.
On my visit this afternoon, Carolyn was wearing her new glasses, which are in the -8.50 range, I loved her newer look, so I wore her -7.50 glasses, and we stood there looking at each other, enjoying the view, when we both, I don't know how it happened, embraced each other and started a long kiss.
I think we both loved it, and did not know how to stop.
I was getting all wet down below, I never had that nice a feeling before like that, I loved it.
We were real friends now, and afterwards, we both said, we really enjoyed the experience.


I was due for another eye exam, and Carolyn told me, it might be a good idea, to get fitted for contact lenses, why, I really don't know, so after my exam, the optician fitted me with contact lenses, and gave me a small box with 6 lenses in my new prescription, to practice, and get use to inserting and removing, my contact lenses.
I also selected a frame, for my new -3.5 prescription.
I wore the contact lenses going home, and my mother was delighted, to see me without wearing glasses.
The contact lenses, were more comfortable, then I had expected.
When I saw Carolyn, I asked her why she wanted me to wear contacts, instead of glasses?
Emily, I prefer your glasses look, but I think you will like, trying glasses over contacts, and after she explained it to me, I kissed her, it sounded so exciting.
A couple of days later I picked up my new glasses, and I like my looks better being a glasses wearing girl, then without my glasses.




The next time I saw Carolyn, she told me her parents were going away for the weekend, and asked me if I would liked to stay with her for a sleep over, yes I love to, I will be there Friday night.
That sure is something to look forward to, so I watched some lesbian porn movies, to find out what might happen, I am not very informed on that subject, and now I have some idea, and looking forward to it..
I now realize that both Carolyn and I are lesbians. 


When I arrived at Carolyn's house, there she was, wearing very strong glasses, Carolyn, what happened?
I am doing g.o.c glasses over contacts, come in, I have a new pair of glasses for you, that is the reason I wanted you to get you to get fitted for contact lenses
Carolyn is always full of surprises, what can I expect this coming weekend.
We went to the bathroom, where Carolyn handed me a pair of contact lenses to put in, and then opened a glasses case, and handed me a pair of glasses to put on. 
I ordered you a pair of - 18.00 glasses.
Wearing the strong contact lenses, I could not see very much, I put the glasses on, and looked around.,and right away had real sexy feeling, what an exciting experience looking through strong glasses.
I looked in the mirror, and loved the look of the lenses, so much depth at them edges of the lens, I loved them, I went over to the window, and everything I looked at looked smaller and more far away, but very clear.
I sure have to get used to wearing the glasses, and slowly followed Carolyn to the kitchen, where she had a pizza in the oven.
After a big hug and kiss, and enjoying the looks of the strong lenses we are each wearing, at last sat down, sat down to enjoy the pizza. 
Then we went for a short walk around the block, and I think these glasses are fantastic, I sure don't want to take them off.


When we came back from our walk, Carolyn walked into the room with a bottle of wine, and sat beside me on the sofa. we slowly sipped the wine, and had some kisses, and before we knew it, it was time to go to bed.
Carolyn said she was going to have a shower, and asked me to get in with her to wash her back.
I am a little shy, and hesitantly, I slowly took my clothes off, but had to wear the glasses, as I could not see much wearing them, Carolyn looked at me and walked over, and slowly put her hand on my chest, you sure have some nice perky breasts, and kissed them. Looking at Carolyn, nice medium size breasts, they are beautiful.
We had our shower, for at least 20 minutes, while we touched and kissed.
After drying each other, we went to bed. 
I could not believe, that female sex, was so good.
I was introduced to a vibrator, a strap on, and when we finally went to sleep, were exhausted.
The next day, was very enjoyable, and we decided, we share a room, when we go to university, and be a couple.


to be continued.
