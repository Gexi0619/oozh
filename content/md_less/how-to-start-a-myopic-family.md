Mrs. Kelley, a glasses wearing young mother was very surprised , when he 4 year old daughter Megan was walking around the house with a brown hand towel over her head , and telling her she now had long hair that she wanted.
Well a year later , Megan had shoulder length hair, and was very proud of tit .
She spend a lot of time brushing and combing it and always liked to look her best.she loved nice hair.

When Megan started in the third grade at school she had a new teacher.
Miss Jones had the most beautiful hair  in a very attractive style, and looking at her face had never realized that glasses could look so nice on a person.
The frames of the glasses were the right color to blend with her hair , and the lenses made her 
eyes look so attractive , she was beautiful,

Megan had never paid much attention to anybody wearing glasses, but thought Miss Jones were 
the nicest shew had ever seen.
When she came home from school, she looked at her mothers glasses , but the lenses did not have the sparkle  , and did not look as nice,her mothers eyes looked larger.
When she talked to her mother about glasses and lenses, she explained that lenses for somebody who was farsighted were different from somebody  who was nearsighted.
Her mother told her she was farsighted, and Miss Jones most likely nearsighted that made her lenses look so much different.
Megan was sure now that if she ever needed  to wear glasses , she wanted to be nearsighted.
Since she had found out the different looks of lenses , Megan paid more attention to students and other people who were wearing  glasses, to see what type of lens they had.

When Megan was ready to start high school , her mother had made an appointment to get Megan s eyes examined,
Megan told her mother she could see just fine, but her mother had noticed some signs , and was sure Megan needed to wear glasses.
During the eye exam when Megan was asked to read the letters, was surprised she could not see them all, did she need to wear glasses?
After the exam the doctor told her she was myopic and needed to wear glasses.
Now that she had to wear glasses was glad she was myopic, and would have the nice looking lenses 
in her glasses.
There was a 2 for 1 special , and with her mother s help , finally decided on the frames that she 
liked.
When the glasses were ready , and Megan put a pair on and looked around could not believe how
nice and clear everything looked , and the improvement in her vision
She liked the looks of her glasses, loved the sparkle of and with the improvement in her vision 
was now a happy glasses wearer, and had 2 nice  pair .of glasses to wear,

Megan was a very active student at high school, she was on the debating team, a member of the drama cub .And a good student.
Since Megan liked fashions so much, her mother arranged for Megan to take a course in self improvement.
The course would teach her the proper way to dress , apply make up , style your hair ,and how to walk properly.
She learned all the twists and turns , to be able to walk in a fashion show , and how to look your best at all times.
Megan enjoyed the course , and it was not long after that she participated in local fashion shows.

By the time Megan was in her last year of high school , her glasses prescription was -3.25 for the right and - 3.50 for the left eye, and she had some astigmatism.
Megan loved wearing her glasses , she could see perfect wearing them, and loved the looks of her lenses.

When looking for a summer job , before starting college to take a fashion course, Megan applied at the local T.V. station for a job as a local news reporter,.
When the station manager interviewed  her was very impressed, and hired here.
Megan s first reporting job was on the reopening of the library after a refurbishing.
Hew camera man was a very experienced older man and gave Megan many good hints.
Management was very pleased with her first report, and was send on more assignments`
After her report on a local fashion show , which was excellent , she was asked to prepare a 
short segment on fashion , yo do after the news to fill the hour.

Megan started with you  notice I wear glasses, and I am happy to have them.I can see perfectly now, and glasses are comfortable to wear 
My mother noticed signs that my vision was not perfect, and had my eyes examined , and I needed to wear glasses
Then she went on about the importance of regular eye exams , starting at an early age .
Glasses are very fashionable now , and with so many choices of frames available every body can look good wearing glasses.
Don t be ashamed that you have to wear glasses, just look around and see how many people wear glasses
You can change your hair style , apply the right make up , and you will look fantastic wearing glasses.
And with the improvement in your vision will be g;lad you have to wear gasses.
After the show management congratulated her on her fashion segment and asked her to prpare more.

The local optical shop owner was so impressed with Megan and her presentation , that he wanted her to do some commercials for him.

When  it was time to go to college, Megan was ready, she had a great educational summer.

of glasses that looked great with the outfit she was wearing.
