After finishing a  business Course, Ashley , a pleasant looking girl started to work in an accounting office.
She liked her job, the people she worked with, and the pay was good.
At home her parents were happy Ashley did so well, and by living at home would have a change to save some money.

A couple of months later Ashley s mother noticed that she seemed to take painkiller pills more often.
When she asked Ashley about it , Ashley told her that lately she seemed to have more headaches lately.
So her mother made an appointment for Ashley with their doctor.
After a thorough examination, the doctor suggested to Ashley to have an eye examination, I have a feeling you should be wearing glasses.
Ashley was in shock, are you sure , I don t want to wear glasses , I don t like them , and I am not going for an eye exam.
When Ashley came home , her mother wanted to know what the doctor had told her after her exam.
Ashley told her , the doctor said I was in good health.

When Ashley went to work the next day , started to take notice of people who wore glasses.
There were 12 people in the office , and 5 of them wore their glasses all the time.
And there were two who only wore their glasses while working.
She noticed that a lot of people looked very nice wearing glasses, but she did not want to wear glasses,
she liked the way she looked.

The head aches continued , so Ashley took her painkiller pills regularly.
Her mother was not satisfied , so she called the doctors office.
The doctor told her Ashley was in good health.
What about the  headaches?
I recommended she should have an eye examination.
When Ashley s mother heard that , she made an appointment for Ashley and herself
When Ashley came home that night her mother told her that lately she had more headaches, and that Mrs. Jones, who wore glasses, suggested to get an eye exam, that most likely she needed to wear glasses.
She told Ashley she had made an appointment for herself and Ashley to have their eyes examined next Saturday.
Ashley did not like that at all, she did not want to wear glasses

On Thursday , Megan one of the girls in the office, came to work wearing glasses.
Ashley noticed the Megan looked very attractive wearing glasses.
She complimented her on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Megan thanked her.
To Ashley s big surprise , nobody seemed to care  that Megan wore glasses now. it was just accepted.
At lunch time, Ashley was sitting at the same table as Megan.
There was some conversation about glasses.
Ashley was very surprised when she heard Megan say that she just loved wearing glasses .
Megan asked her why she loved wearing glasses ?
I can see so much better now, I love the looks of them and they are comfortable to wear. 
 My boyfriend likes the looks of me wearing glasses.
Ashley was now very confused, how could a person love wearing glasses, and that men liked the looks of women wearing glasses.
She still did not want to wear glasses.

Saturday morning came, and Ashley and her mother went to the optical store in the mall.
When they entered the store, Ashley could not believe the large selection of eyeglass frames on display.
They were asked to fill out some papers, and then Ashley s mother went in for her exam.
When Ashley looked around the store, the optician suggested she should try some frames, to see what she would look like wearing glasses.
Ashley was very hesitant , so the optician handed her a frame
.She slowly put it on and looked at herself.
She could not believe how different she looked , and was not sure  if she liked that look.
The optician told her she looked fantastic wearing glasses.
A few minutes later her mother came out of the examination room, and told her she was prescribed glasses.
Oh mom I feel so sorry for you.
I don t mind , a lot of people wear glasses , you can help me select a nice frame , after you had your exam.
Megan went into the examination room.
The optometrist shone a light in her eyes, and asked her do you have quite a few headaches?
How do you know, did my mother tell you?
No, she did not tell me , but I notice you have a bit of astigmatism.
Now we will check your eyes reading the chart.
Megan was able to read almost all the lines , so she told him , see I don t need glasses.
Now I would like you to read the small print.
Can you move the card a little further away?
A few clicks and Ashley  told him she could now see the letters  perfectly.
Next he asked which is better 1 or 2  and so on.
When the exam was finished the optometrist told Ashley   that she was farsighted and had some astigmatism.
I recommend you wear your glasses full time..
Ashley was almost in tears when she saw her mother and told her that she had to wear glasses.
Her mother told her, it is not the end of the world, let s look at some frames.
After selecting a frame for Megan and then her mother, they were told to come back in about an hour and the glasses would be ready.

They went to the food court for some refreshments .
Ashley s mother mentioned that she noticed almost half the people I see walking by wear glasses , even children and young people.
So if it makes you feel better , we wont be the only ones wearing glasses.

When they went to pick up their g;lasses , Ashley s mother was fitted first .
When she looked around noticed an improvement in her vision,and looking in the mirror liked her new look.
Mom you look great wearing glasses, I love your look and I am sure dad will like them.
Now it was Ashley s turn, the optician put the glasses on her face, and made some adjustments and the asked her to look at a magazine.
Ashley could not believe how clear the letters were and how easy it was to read,
Then she looked in the mirror.
She could not believe how much bigger and nicer he eyes looked , and how nice the frame blended with the color of her hair.
The optician told her that her distance vision would be perfect after wearing her glasses for a couple of weeks.
Ashley s mother told her she looked beautiful.
After they came home and received compliments on their new look from the rest of the family.
Ashley went to her bedroom to have a good look at herself.
She was still very upset about having to wear glasses, and decided she was only going to wear them at work.
where nobody seemed to care that you wore glasses.
That week Ashley only wore her glasses at work.
She noticed work now was much easier and no headaches.
She did not bother wearing her glasses going back and forth to work.

It was Sunday, and the family got ready to go to church.
When Ashley s s mother noticed she was not wearing her glasses, told her to get them and put them on.
When they entered the church and sat down, Ashley felt very uneasy , as if everybody was looking at her.

After  the service when they left the church, Mark , a boy Ashley had a crush on in highschool, came over.
Ashley I am so glad to see you, you look fantastic.
I finished my studies and am now back in town  starting a new job.
Would you like to come and see a movie with me ?
Yes , I would like to.
Mark told her he would pick her up at 2 o clock.

Ashley was all excited,Mark looked so attractive and grown up.
She spend more time on her make up, highlighted her eyes , put her glasses on and looked at herself.
Perhaps it was not so bad having to wear glasses, she started to kind of like the way she looked wearing them.

Mark was right on time.

He complimented Ashley on how nice she looked, and escorted her to his car.
When they were seated , Mark pulled out a pair of glasses and put them on.
I did not know you wore glasses .
How long have you had them ?
About a month ago , when I failed the vision test for my drivers license renewal.
Well I think you should wear glasses all the time , you look so studious  and the glasses suit you, you look fantastic.
Thanks for the compliment, since I am the only one in the family wearing glasses, I am a bit shy about wearing them.
But I have to wear them when i am driving, it is on my license.

When they got to the mall. Mark was going to take his glasses off.
Ashley suggested he wear his glasses ,so he got used to wearing them in public, and I like them you look.so nice wearing them.

After the movie , sitting in the food court for some refreshments, Mark asked Ashley how she liked wearing glasse.
I have only been wearing them for a couple of weeks, they have cured my headaches and my vision is great.
I mam slowly getting used to them.
I do find glasses comfortable to wear,and I am getting used to seeing myself wearing glasses.
I think I now start to like my glasses.
What about you?
Well the glasses improved my distance vision, as I told you I am a bit shy, but I like wearing them ,
I always wanted to wear glasses .
Now that I have them  have to get used to be seen wearing them.
I should wear them all the time like my optometrist told me.
Well you got a good start this afternoon, and I suggest you wear them to your new job on Monday, then everybody knows you wear glasses.
Ashley I think you are right , I will start wearing my glasses all the time now,
You made me do it. Thank you very much.
Ashley smiled we are quite a pair.
We get new glasses , are hesitant to wear them.
Then realize we need to wear them to see properly.
And after a while start to like wearing them , and like the looks of them.
I am now beginning to realize there is really nothing more exciting then getting to wear glasses.
