The accident, changed my life.






Jennifer, Amber and Sadie are, very close friends, and have been since grade one.
Jennifer, is the blonde with nice long hair, and big blue eyes.
Amber, is a redheaded, very pretty girl, and Sadie, has long black hair, and is growing into, a beautiful, young woman..


All, three, are growing fast, and are of course, are  going through puberty. they spend most of their of time, talking about, all their pimples, hairdo’s and discussing, all the changes, that are taking place, and about articles in fashion magazines, styles, and a whole lot of other things, besides their studies in high school.


To day, when Sadie, came home to day,, her mother reminded her, about her annual eye exam, Friday, after school.
Do I have to go?
Yes, you do, the health of your eyes, is very important, and I think, that after, your vision test, you might be told, that you need to wear glasses., I noticed, you do a lot of squinting lately, and you have had headaches.
Mom, I can see just fine..
Well, we find out on Friday.
I, don’t want to wear glasses.
Well, if you need to wear glasses, you are going to wear them.
I started wearing glasses, when I was about your age, and like wearing them,, 
It is no big deal, having to wear glasses, a lot of people wear glasses.


What a surprise, I had forgotten about the eye exam.
I think, my mother is right, that I will be prescribed to wear glasses, lately, I have trouble reading the writing, on the blackboard.
I decided, not to tell my friends, that I have to go for an eye exam, until after, I had the exam.


The next day, I started looking, at every student, who wears glasses, and now I realize, most of them look very nice, wearing glasses.
Perhaps, wearing glasses, is not so bad, like my mother said. you most likely, will like wearing glasses, with all the new frames available, you should be able to look very nice.


The day of the eye exam, my mother, drove me to the optical store.
After the exam, the optometrist, gave me my prescription, and told me to wear the glasses full time.
The optician, was a big help, finding me a frame, that I really liked, and now I feel a little better, about having to wear glasses.
My glasses will be ready, in the morning..


What an exciting experience it was, when, I was looking around, wearing my new glasses.
I could not believe, how nice and well defined, everything looked, and now I could see the leaves on the trees, I loved it.
Looking at my self in a mirror, liked the way I looked, wearing glasses 
Wearing glasses, sure changes everything, the way your vision improves, and how you look.
The girls. sure, will be surprised, this afternoon, when they see me, wearing my new glasses.


The girls were waiting for me, when I walked into the room, wearing my glasses, I just stood there, they both, looked at me, before they said anything.
Sadie, you look, fantastic wearing glasses, I did not know you had to wear glasses, how do you like your glasses.?


After, I had told them the whole story, of the eye exam, and the fantastic experience, of my improved vision, I had put my glasses on for the first time. Then, they both asked me if they could try the glasses.
Jennifer, could not believe, how the glasses, improved her vision.
She had not realized, her vision was that poor, and will ask her mother to have her eyes examined, she is sure, that she needs to wear glasses.
Amber, liked how she looked, wearing my glasses, but could not see very well, when she was wearing the glasses..


Jennifer, as she had expected, is now wearing glasses.
She loves her improved vision, and her new, glasses wearing look.


Amber told us, that she had an eye exam, but her vision is perfect, no glasses for her.
She had wished, she would have been prescribed glasses, because, she sure, loves her glasses wearing look, after she had tried different frames, at the optical store when she had her eye exam, 
Amber noticed, that a lot of the guys, seem to like the looks, of girls wearing glasses .


During the next few years, both Sadie and Jennifer, had regular increases, in their glasses prescription.
Sadie, is in the -5.00 range, almost the same as Jennifer.
Poor Amber, is jealous, because, she still does not need to wear glasses.


After all three, received their high school diplomas, they went to business college, to take a two year course, to be ready, for the business world.


Boyfriends, have been part of their lives, since high school.
Sadie, has been, Kevin’ s, girl, for a few years,.
Kevin is a handsome, glasses wearing, good looking young man, who enjoys playing golf.
Kevin, is myopic, and wears, -7.50 glasses, he likes wearing glasses, and is proud of his glasses wearing look.


Jennifer, has a boyfriend, who is a football player, and plays, on the university’s football team.
A good looking, well build man, about a foot taller then Jennifer, and is studying, to be an optometrist.


Amber had some boyfriends, but she is not going steady, with anyone.


Part 2


David Jones, is an army surgeon, who keeps on dreaming about a beautiful red headed, glasses wearing women.
He would like to get married, and is going to leave his present position, when his contract expires, in another month, and work as a general surgeon, in his home town. 


Part 3


On a beautiful, sunny, winter day, we decided to go to the local ski hill, and have some fun. 
We rented skies, and went up the tow, and down the hill, and had a great time.
It was busy, a lot of people around, and of course some snowboarders.


All our fun ended, when Amber, after colliding with a snowboarder, went flying, and hit a tree. 
We went to see how she was, and realized she had passes out.
Next thing we knew, Amber was in the hospital, with a broken arm, and a serious head injury.


Dr. David was on duty, when Amber came to the hospital.
When, he saw Amber, he knew, that she was the women he had been dreaming about.
After a head scan, and X ray’s , David decided, to look after the eye injuries, and implanted new lenses in both eyes.


A few days later, when Amber started to get a little better, she noticed her vision was not very good, everything she looked at, looked very fuzzy, and she could not see any detail, and she also noticed, she could not hear properly hear properly., when anybody spoke to her.


After, a few more, examinations, she was prescribed, to wear glasses, and to wear hearing aids,
Her glasses will be strong, with – 12.00 lenses.


The hearing aids, have made a big difference, and Amber likes it , that she can increase, and lower the sound volume.
Sadie and Jennifer, were a big help, finding Amber, a good looking frame, because Amber, could not see well enough, to find a frame she liked.


A few days later when Amber, started to wear her new glasses, loved her new glasses wearing look, and her good vision. 
At first she was very surprised, when she noticed her strong looking lenses. 
After looking at herself wearing her glasses, now, likes the looks of the stronger lenses, she likes the looks of the rings, and the thickness, of the edges on the lenses.
She is very proud of the fact, that she now wears a higher prescription than Sadie, and Jennifer.king at herself, she now likes the looks of the stronger lenses, which show a lot of rings, and make her big eyes look smaller.
Now, wearing the glasses, and her hearing aids, she can see and hear properly again. 


Amber had an appointment, wit Dr. David, for a check up.
Dr. David, checked Amber’s vision., and wanted to know if she had any problems
No, everything is fine, I can see, and hear properly now.
Well, I am glad to hear that. you look beautiful wearing glasses, and I am glad the hearing aids work well.
Do I have to come back and see you again ?
Yes, if you like to have dinner with me.
I would like that, doctor.
Please call me David, and I will come and get you to night, and we will celebrate your recovery.


The dinner was very enjoyable, and we talked about a lot of different things
He told me again how nice I looked wearing glasses.
One of the benefits, of having auburn red hair, is that I can wear and look good, wearing frameless glasses, metal frames, tortoise shell, and black frames.
David agreed, he told me he likes the looks of glasses, and he thinks hearing aids look sexy.
I, love the guy


For my birth day, David, gave me a gift certificate, for the optical store, I liked that, and asked him to come with me, and help me select a couple of new frames.


We had a great time at the optical store, to find a frame, we both liked.
Now, I have three pairs of glasses, how lucky can a girl get?


Not long after David and I got married. 
We are a happy couple, I am so glad I wear glasses, I love them.
David likes my glasses look, with the nice lenses, and what he calls, the sexy hearing aids.
My life changed, for the best, because of my accident.
