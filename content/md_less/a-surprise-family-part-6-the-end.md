Bailey had only been wearing the -12D glasses for a few weeks and I wasn’t even sure she had adapted to them yet. When I told her that Dr. Sadler was going to examine her eyes and get her new, thinner lensed glasses for the wedding she wasn’t sure she wanted to do that. I had not told her that her eye exam and the new glasses were going to be my wedding gift from Dr. Sadler, and I could not understand why she wasn’t thrilled about this. The following morning, she went to my dresser drawer and took out the -14D glasses, which she put on and wore to school. Then it hit me. She didn’t want new thin lensed glasses in the -12D prescription she had been wearing. She would wear the -14D glasses until her eye exam and she was hoping that she would be able to adapt to the stronger lenses. We didn’t have much time as the wedding was going to be in 3 months and I needed at least a week to get Bailey’s new glasses in from the lab.
 
The next day I was at work I checked Dr. Sadler’s schedule carefully. He had an opening in the late afternoon a week before what I considered the last possible safe day to get Bailey’s new glasses, so I booked her appointment. I knew what Bailey was trying to do and I wanted to give her as much time as I possibly could to get used to wearing a -14D prescription. I didn’t really think it would work, but I wanted to try  if that was what she wanted. Bailey had shown a lot of resiliency when it came to increasing her prescription. I couldn’t say anything to her, because I had done almost the same thing and I was quite happy with my prescription.
 
Fortunately, everything worked out well. Mildred’s health had not deteriorated as quickly as we had been worried about. Bailey had her eye exam and Dr. Sadler told her the -14D glasses were slightly stronger than she really needed, but since she had been wearing that prescription, he was going to let her continue with it. She chose a similar frame to mine, and I ordered her new 1.74 index glasses. I was tempted to put a rush on the order, but in other instances doing this had not worked well. Bailey’s new glasses arrived within 6 days, so I was relieved. As the Saturday of the wedding approached, I was getting the jitters, but things were going so smoothly I managed to calm myself down a little.
 
I had told Ben that I didn’t want to move out of Mildred’s house until Mildred had either gone to assisted living or had passed away. But Mildred had her own ideas. She was booked into a full time care home, and she would be moving on the Monday after our wedding. Since Ben and I were both working we felt we would book the honeymoon suite at one of the hotels in the city and we would be there for Mildred on the day she moved. Ben and I wanted to renovate and update Mildred’s home before we moved in together so we had rented a furnished 2 bedroom apartment by the month that Ben and I, along with Bailey, could live in while the renovations were going on. We were not going to do anything major, but paint and new floors along with new furniture were a priority. Bailey and I were used to the bathroom so I felt it was fine, but Ben insisted on having the bathroom done over as well so our apartment stay might be as long as 3 months.
 
I had worried about the wedding needlessly. Everything went as planned and my co worker bridesmaids surprised me by also wearing glasses that day. I had found a wedding dress – at the same thrift store where I had purchased the 5 pairs of glasses back when I was 16 and it fit perfectly. I loved it on first sight and although it was not on the half price rack it was still going to cost me a lot less than if I bought a new one. When I brought it home and showed it to Bailey and Mildred, they both loved it as well. I felt like a queen when Ben’s father Paul walked me down the aisle.
 
Even though I was wearing my glasses, the wedding and the reception were just a blur in my memory. By the end of the evening, when Ben and I left the reception to go to our hotel I had accepted the fact that I was now married. The only thing that could have been better about this day would have been if my mom had been there to see all of this.
 
I had not wanted to get pregnant before we were married so I was taking birth control pills. And I was going to continue taking them for a little longer. I had a while to go before I could take the exams to become a licensed optician, and both Ben and I felt that I should finish my training. Bailey had been talking with me about possibly getting a job with Dr. Sadler once she graduated from high school, but I didn’t think he would be able to find a place for her unless Gail or Heather quit, and it didn’t look like either of them were about to do that. I suggested that Bailey should go to school and get the training that I had done online, but she worried that she would not have the money. I told her that she was my sister, and I would pay for it. She allowed me to do this, and she began training as an optician. I didn’t tell Bailey, but Ben and I had discussed me quitting after I did get pregnant, so if Bailey became a licensed optician, I was quite sure that Dr. Sadler would hire Bailey to replace me when I left.
 
Mildred passed away peacefully, and soon after that Bailey became a licensed optician. I had not planned to get pregnant until after Bailey had completed her schooling, but when Ben and I went to her graduation I was in my third month. Bailey started working as my replacement as soon as she had her license, and since Ben was doing well at his law firm, I retired to have our first child. What a surprise having all this family had turned out to be.
