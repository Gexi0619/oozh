The new school year started, Nicole a pleasant lively girl was happy to go into grade 4.
When she arrived at school and saw all her friends, and there was her best friend Carolyn, they were happy to see each other and had lots to talk about.
They had a new teacher this year, Miss Jones a tall brunette, with a kind face and a big smile and wearing glasses.
Nicole was very impressed, she looked very friendly and the glasses made her look beautiful . She told Carolyn how much she liked the looks of Miss Jones glasses, her eyes seem to sparkle.
Nicole had never really noticed glasses on people before, none of her family wore glasses, but she became aware of them now, when looking at Miss Jones.
During recess Nicole went to Miss Jones and told her how nice her glasses looked.
miss Jones smiled and told Nicole that she was very happy with her glasses, they helped her see everything nice and clear.
Being young Nicole wondered how come  you could see everything better wearing glasses.
When she talked to her Mom that night, her mother explained to her that some people had trouble seeing things, and needed glasses to see properly. Nicole was wondering if she would need glasses someday, she did not think she would mind if it would help you see things better, and she liked the looks of glasses.

When the next school year cam, miss Jones was  wearing new glasses and Nicole thought they were nicer looking than last years.
She was wondering what it would be like to wear glasses, she thought she would not mind having to wear glasses, there was something special about glasses she could not explain
After the Christmas break one of Nicole s friends Jenny cam to school wearing glasses, she told Nicole she had trouble seeing the blackboard and her mother had taken her for an eye exam and was told she should wear glasses, she only had to wear them in class.
She let Nicole try her glasses, Nicole carefully put them on, everything looked a little fuzzy,but she liked the feel of them on her face, and when she looked at herself in the bathroom mirror liked the way she looked. She would like to have her own glasses, they were exciting.
Nicole now started to notice any of the girls that wore glasses and how nice they looked wearing them. She noticed quite a few boys wearing glasses too, but she was more interested in the girls they looked nicer.
A few years later when Nicole was in High school, her sister Carol,who was a few years older started to wear glasses.
Nicole was allowed to try them on and noticed she could see reasonable well wearing them, she loved the looks and the fell of the glasses and hated to give them back to her sister.
Since her sister did not wear her glasses all the time, she sometimes left them on her desk, and because they shared the bedroom, Nicole could not wait for her sister to leave so she could wear her glasses. She had noticed she could see well wearing them, and the glasses made her feel sexy, they aroused her , and she loved looking at herself wearing the glasses.

Nicole was ready to apply for her drivers license, and then realized if she could fake the eye test, she would have to go for an eye exam.
When Nicole was at the D.M.V. she filled out the necessary forms and the vision test was next.
When she looked at the letters, they looked blurry , and she had a hard time reading them all properly. The examiner told her to come back after she had an eye exam, as she did not read all the letters right. She was very happy to have to go for an eye exam, and also surprised, because she thought her vision was perfect.
An eye appointment was mad at Jones Optical.
She was very exited , and enjoyed the exam, and of course was very happy when Dr, Jim told her she was myopic and should wear glasses.
Her prescription was -1.00 for the right and - 075 for the left eye and a bit of astigmatism. Than the fun started.
She had a wonderful time looking and trying all the frames.
Marsha the optician helped her select a sharp looking frame that she loved , and was told to come back in a couple of hours and her glasses would be ready.
She never had been so excited , and was sexually aroused just thinking about her very own new glasses.
, she could not wait.
When she returned to Jones Optical, Marsha asked her to take a seat . She asked Nicole to put her glasses on so she could adjust them. Then when Nicole looked around , everything looked nice and clear, and she loved her new look.
Nicole was a happy girl, at last she had her own glasses that she had dreamed of, since miss Jones became her new teacher in
grade 4.
When her friend Carolyn came over to Nicole s house, and saw her wearing her new glasses , told her how great she looked.Of course Carolyn had to try the glasses and when she put them on Nicole looked at her and said, you look fantastic, your face is made to wear glasses, you look so nice I feel like kissing you, Carolyn said O.K. I let you , wearing these glasses make me feel sexy, so they had a kiss and a hug, and then Nicole wanted her glasses back.
Carolyn said I never realized that glasses could be this exciting  and feel so comfortable.
I had no problem seeing with them, I think I would like to get my own. I will ask my mother if I can make an appointment for an eye exam.

The following Saturday Nicole and Carolyn went to Jones Optical for the appointment.
While Carolyn had her exam, Nicole tried some frames and had a talk with Marsha and decided that since she liked glasses so much,
might become an optician that would be the right kind of job for her.
Carolyn came out of the examination room with a big smile on her face, she needed to wear glasses.
The girls with Marsha s help selected a frame that seemed to be made just for her, and they would be ready in a couple of hours.
After some lunch the two excited girls went to pick up Carolyn s glasses.
The glasses were ready and it did not take long to get them fitted properly. Carolyn loved her new look, and Nicole could not stop looking at her she looked so sexy and beautiful.
They went to Carolyn s place to show her mother the new glasses. She thought they looked very nice and complimented both girls on their new look.
The girls went upstairs to Carolyn s bedroom to talk and try each others glasses and decided that their prescription was about the same.
Carolyn told Nicole that the glasses aroused her , do you feel that way to she asked. Nicole walked over to Carolyn, gave her a big hug and kiss and said the glasses made me do it, Carolyn kissed her back and said I agree.
After High school they went to college together, Nicole to become an optician, Carolyn took a business course., they roomed together and loved each others company
After Graduating they moved into an apartment and were very comfortable living together.

One night the girls were reminiscing , Nicole told Carolyn that she had become aware of glasses, when miss Jones  became their teacher. She had been so impresses by miss Jones glasses, he looks of the lenses, her sparkling eyes, and how beautiful she looked
wearing glasses. That is when she started looking at at other people wearing glasses, and how nice they looked.
And when their classmate Jenny , had come to school wearing glasses and let her try her glasses, changed everything, she remembered that when she saw herself in the mirror wearing Jenny s glasses ,knew she wanted to wear glasses. Now that she had them, loved them and did not want to be without her lovely glasses.
