My name is Jenny.
I am all excited, I am picking up my new glasses to day.
My first pair of new glasses in 3 years.
The new prescription is up another 3/4 diopter, and now is – 6.75.
I started to wear glasses , when I was in grade 3.
Since then ,my prescription grew just about as fast as I did.

I have finished my studies, and  now have a good job, with benefits.
To day after work I went to the optical store to pick up my glasses.
When I arrived there, the optician handed me my glasses .
I put them  on , and noticed right away the big improvement in my vision.
Looking at myself ,I was very pleased with my choice of frames, and loved  my new look.
I put the old pair of glasses in my purse, and headed for home.
I decided to take the subway, it would be the quickest way to get home.
Walking to the station and looking around , it was such a pleasure to be able to  see everything so clear .

When I got on the train,  was surprised how crowded it was.
Getting close to my stop ,I proceeded to the exit.
The train stopped ,  it seemed everybody wanted to get of at this stop.
When looking down trying to see the step at the doorway , somebody bumped me hard, and my glasses went flying.
I had no idea where my glasses went.
With my limited vision , I tried to see where my glasses might have gone, but I could not see them.
Before I knew it, I was standing on the platform, and the train was leaving.
Stunned, and mad , I dug into my purse and retrieved my old glasses, and put them on so I could see.
I looked around , but no glasses.
I went to the lost and found office and told my story.
They suggested I come back in a couple of days to see if my  glasses were turned in.
I was almost in tears , I loved my new glasses , and am quite sure that my benefits at work stated one pair of glasses every 2 years.
Thank goodness I still had my old glasses , they would have to do for a little while longer.
When I came home my mother asked me where my new glasses were.
I told her what had happened on the subway.
Well perhaps somebody will find them and turn them in to lost and found .
With a little bit of luck , perhaps you will get your glasses back.

                                            -------

Mom, I am home. I picked up the stuff that you asked me to.
I put the great big shopping bag on a kitchen chair, and went to the fridge to get a cold beer.
I sat down to enjoy my beer , when my mother came into the kitchen.
Thank you Geoffrey for picking  up  the bag , I did not really want to go down to the store to get it.
Let s have supper and I will unpack it later.
After supper I settled down to watch the news.

A  little later  my mother came into the room , Geoffrey look, these glasses were in the bag.
Where did you get them.
She showed me a nice pair of glasses.
I had no idea, where the glasses came from.
I went to the store and asked for your purchase , they handed me the bag and I came home.
My mother handed  me the glasses.
I looked them over, they looked like women s type  glasses.
Since I wear glasses , I knew the lenses were for myopia.
I tried the glasses on , they were to strong for me.
Where did the glasses come from ?
Somebody wearing glasses with this prescrpiption , sure would miss them.
I phoned the store where I had picked up the bag , and told them we had found a pair of eyeglasses 
in the bag.
They were very surprised to hear that.
 None of their staff members had lost their glasses , and they  had no idea where the glasses came from.

My mother mentioned that at the local super market is a board for announcements, and for articles lost and found.
She suggested I put a notice on the board , if somebody in the area had lost their glasses  , they might read the notice.
That night I placed a notice on the board.
FOUND PAIR OF WOMEN S GLASSES, and my phone number.
I sure would like to know who the glasses belong to , and to see what she would look like wearing those glasses.

                                                       -----------

A couple of days later, full of anticipation , I went back to the subway lost and found.
There was a lady in the office.
I told her my story, and asked if anybody might have found my glasses.
She told me to wait.
The lady went to a cupboard and came back with a box  full of eyeglasses.
I was surprised by the large number of glasses in the box , and had never realized that so many people lost their glasses.
I looked them all over , but my glasses were not there.
Dissapointed , I thanked the lady, and went home.


A few days later , my mother told me that when she went shopping for groceries, had taken a look at the lost and found on the bulletin board.
There was a notice that read, found, a pair of ladies glasses , and a phone number.
I wrote the phone number down, here it is.
When I called the number a very pleasant man s voice answered the phone.
He asked me for a description of the glasses.
After I had told him , he told me , I think they might be your glasses.
He suggested we meet at The Coffee Shop ,Saturday morning about 10, and he would bring the glasses.
I told him I would be there .
Later on I realized , that I had no idea who I would be looking for.
All I knew it was a man with a very pleasant voice, who might have my glasses.

                                             -----------

After the phone call , Geoffrey was really looking forward to meeting the lady.
She sounded real nice on the phone , he would not wait  to see ,what she would look like  wearing the glasses.
He sure was looking forward to Saturday.
When Saturday morning  came , Geoffrey made sure he looked his best.
He  put the glasses in a case and slid them in his pocket.

When he arrived at The Coffee Shop, sat down at an empty table facing the door.
The waitress came over to take his order.
Geoffrey told her he was not ready yet to order , that he was waiting for somebody to join him.
Not long after, a very pretty , well built girl wearing glasses came in.
Geoffrey noticed right away , that she was wearing glasses for myopia.
He went over to her and said , I think you are looking for me
My name is Geoffrey,  I am glad to meet you.
Would you like to sit down and have a cup of coffee.

                                                ----------

Geoffrey  sure is  a very  handsome guy , I won t mind having coffee with him.
If the glasses he has are not mine , it sure was a pleasure meeting him.
After the waitress had brought our coffee, and I had told him my name.
Geoffrey asked me  if I knew where I had lost my glasses.
I told him my story, including the time and date, and gave him a description of my glasses.
Geoffrey told me of how  he had come on the same train , and that  his mother had found the glasses
in the shopping bag he had been carrying at that time.
He took the glasses out of his pocket , and opened the case.
There were my glasses.
He handed me the case , and I put my glasses on.
I was so happy to have my new glasses back, that I walked over to Geoff and gave him a great big kiss and thanked him.
Geoffrey was all smiles , and complimented me how nice the glasses looked on me .
While we were enjoying our coffee , we talked about glasses and vision, and a few other things.
Now I knew we both liked  glasses.
I hated to leave, to go home.
It was so nice to have some pleasant conversation with such a nice guy.
Then he asked me , Jenny if you are free to night , I would like to take you out for dinner.
Of course I accepted.
Later   he said I like to  take you  home , I have my car here , and then I will know where you live.
He was a real gentleman , he opened the door for me, and waited for me to be seated before he closed it.

When we got to my place , Geoffrey walked me to the door , and told me he would be back at six o clock to pick me up to go to dinner.

When my mother opened the door said.
There you are, and are wearing your new glasses.
I am so glad you got them back ,and  they look very nice on you.
Who is that handsome man who brought you home?

His name is Geoffrey, he is the one who found my glasses.
He asked me out for dinner to night
Well this must be your lucky day .
You  not only found your glasses , but also a very handsome man.

It took me a long time to get ready for my date.
I must have done a good job with my make up.
When I looked in the mirror wearing my new glasses , I thought I looked terrific.
I just loved the looks of the stronger lenses and how they showed some nice  rings.
I felt on top of the world.

I was ready when Geoffrey came.
The first thing he did was compliment me how beautiful I looked, wearing my new glasses .
He told me he loved the way my eyes looked , so nicely framed behind the new lenses.
I know I blushed.
Geoffrey took me to a very romantic restaurant .
We had a delicious dinner ,and enjoyed spending some time on the dance floor.
What a romantic night.
I now realized that if I had not lost my glasses , this night would never  have happened.
Geoffrey must have read my mind ,when he said..
Boy am I glad you lost your glasses and I was lucky enough to find them .
The wonderful  night ended to soon.
We both had liked it so well , we had many more romantic nights after that.
I I lost my new glasses !!!!!
