Jennifer , a glasses wearing brunette, with a pleasant smile and personality, was very popular with the university students in her year.She was always ready to help somebody, either with school work or another problems they may have.
She was a top of the class student, and also very knowledgeable of the latest fashion trends and make up, and she always looked it.
Karen one of her classmates asked her one day, if she could help her.
The problem was that she had noticed her vision getting worse and thought she might need glasses. She did not want to wear glasses,
because she did not think she would look good wearing glasses, and also was afraid that her boyfriend would not like her anymore if she had to wear glasses, what should she do?
Jennifer suggested she get her eyes examined first to see if she really needed glasses, and if she did ,not to worry about having to wear them. The glasses would improve her vision, and besides glasses are very fashionable right now, there are all kinds of nice frames available, now anybody can look good wearing glasses.
If your boyfriend does not like glasses, well that is not the end of the world, there are lots of guys that do like girls who wear glasses, you won t have any problem getting a date with a guy who likes you  for looking the way you are , even if you wear glasses.
Jennifer than asked Karen if she had noticed how many more students were wearing glasses now, and how attractive most of them looked.
Karen said she had noticed, and thought Jennifer was right,  on most people glasses looked very nice, she had always thought Jennifer looked fantastic wearing glasses.
The following day, Karen told Jennifer she had an appointment at Jones Optical for Saturday, and wondered since she did not know very much about glasses , if she would mind to go with her she would love some help.
Jennifer told her she would love to go with her.

Karen met Jennifer at Jennifer at Jones Optical and when they entered the store were greeted by Marsha, the optician.  After filling out the necessary papers , Karen was directed into the examination room, where Dr. Jim gave her a thorough examination, He told her she was myopic with some astigmatism and needed to wear glasses to correct her problem.
He showed her by changing the lenses how much her eyesight would improve wearing glasses
Karen was very impressed when he showed her the difference realized that she had to wear glasses.
Her prescription read -1.50 for the right and - 1.75 for the left eye, and some astigmatism. Dr. Jim suggested she should wear her glasses all day.

Jennifer was not surprised the Karen needed to wear glasses, and helped her select a real nice colored frame that blended perfectly with her hair and eye color, and looked as if they were made just for her.
After the necessary measurements were completed they were told to come back later and the glasses would be ready.
The girls went to the mall for some refreshments., and of course had lots to talk about, and happy getting to know each other better.
Karen mentioned to Jennifer how she had enjoyed the eye exam, it had given her a very exciting feeling when the lenses were being changed, and was wondering if the lenses in her glasses would give her that feeling to. Jennifer told her that she always felt pleasantly different when she got a new prescription , it always seemed to give her a real nice feeling.
Karen asked Jennifer if she could try her glasses to see how they might feel.
Jennifer handed Karen her glasses, and when she put them on realized the lenses were a little to strong for her, but gave her that wonderful feeling , she loved it.
This feeling you get looking through trough the lenses is fantastic, like a sexual arousal. I can t wait for my own glasses now if that 
is how I am going to feel wearing them.
Karen was now looking forward to getting her glasses, they would improve her vision but there was also something  exciting about them.
The girls were in a giddy mood when they returned to Jones Optical to pick up Karen s new glasses.
When Marsha the optician put Karen s glasses on her and got them properly adjusted, asked Karen how well she could see with them.  Karen smiled and said fantastic, I can see everything nice and clear, and they feel very comfortable.
When she looked at herself in the mirror, could not believe her eyes,
The frame blended beautiful with her hair  and loved how her eyes seemed to sparkle behind the lenses.
She loved her new look, and was happy with her new glasses, she was all excited.

When the girls came home, Jennifer suggested to Karen if she wanted to come over on Sunday, since she had a date Saturday night,
she would be glad to help her with her eye make up.This will help make your eyes look more attractive wearing glasses.
Karen said that s great, I would like to learn to do it properly.

When Karen arrived at Jennifer s place, they were glad to see each other, and gave each other a big hug.
Jennifer looked at Karen and said you look great wearing those glasses, we sure picked the right frame for you.
Karen said thanks to you I can now see properly and have never felt as good about myself.
Jennifer wanted to hear all about Karen s date and her boyfriends reaction about her new look.
Karen smiled, she told Jennifer it was exactly what she had expected. Her boyfriend hated her new look, and would not go out with her if she wore glasses. So Karen told him he could stay home and play with himself, she loved her glasses and was going to wear them. So she went to bed early and pleasured herself wearing her wonderful new glasses and had a great night.
Jennifer laughed when she heard the story, had loved Karen s reaction, she was her kind of girl.
The Girls had a great time. Jennifer showed Karen how to use eye shadow and liner to make her eyes look more attractive, and they both agreed the results were fantastic.  Karen loved it she never had felt this beautiful  , and realized it was because of her new glasses and proper eye make up.
Jennifer loved having such a good time, she really liked Karen very much, and of course had always liked girls better than boys,
They opened a bottle of wine , made a plate of biscuits and cheese, and sat down on the chesterfield, talking and enjoying themselves.
Karen asked Jennifer if they could trade glasses for a minute, she would like to feel the reaction of a little stronger prescription again. So when Karen put on Jennifer s glasses she said I get this lovely feeling again when wearing your glasses, it makes me feel wonderful. I will do even better than that said Jennifer, as she put her arm around her and caressed her breast and gave her a kiss., and at the same time put her other hand on Karen s thigh and slowly moved to her hot spot.
Karen groaned and loved it, and moved her hand to Jennifer s hot spot, and when both girls reached their climax, kissed some more 
and than slowly recovered.
They both thought it had been a wonderful experience.   Karen said I am happy now that I have to wear glasses and to have met you, let me give you back your glasses, and I will take mine.  I am so happy with my glasses and what they have done for me, but I also might want to borrow your glasses again some other time. Jennifer said that sounds great and gave Karen another big kiss.
