They, are my type !


There was a quote., between Carrie, and Nadameeloise100, that I liked, so I wrote this story.


There is something, I don't know, what it is, about wearing glasses, I guess I will find out sometime.
I started to wear glasses, in grade 3, but was not a happy youngster, I did not like wearing glasses.
Because, my prescription was not very strong, I was sure, there was no need, to wear my glasses, I could see all I wanted to see, not wearing my glasses, so why bother wearing them.
My parents, never asked me, why I did not wear my glasses, they were sure, I wore them everyday, when at school. 
And I forgot, the date for my next eye exam, and I sure was not going to remind them.


Like everything else, all good things, come to an end sometime.
It sure did, when, my report card was not very good, and I almost flunked, that would have been horrible, because I wanted to go to high school..


We were, on a family vacation, my parents, me, and my two younger sisters
We stayed at a fancy hotel, in the mountains, I heard the all the talk, about the beautiful scenery.
I could not see it, but agreed, that the scenery, was beautiful.
Then, my younger sister Amy, told my parents, she had trouble seeing, what they were talking about, everything far away looks blurry.
Then I heard them say, Amber, can you see everything all right ?,
Why are you not wearing your glasses., you know, you are supposed to wear your glasses all the time, not just at school.
Most of my class mates, have never seen me, wear my glasses
No, mom, everything in the distance is a little fuzzy, sorry, I forgot to bring my glasses. 
Well, when we get home, all of you, are going to have an eye exam.
That is what happens, if you give an honest answer.!


We are now back, from our holidays. and Amy reminded my mother about the eye appointment.
Now we all are going to have an eye exam, next week.


I never before, mentioned my dear friend Cindy.
We have been friends, for a long time, and spend a lot of time together.
Lately, we are very aware of all our body changes, and that, has been most of our
discussion, every time we see it other.
Using all the information, we get from using the computer, we are now well educated , about sex, boys, girls, and all the facts of life, beauty, hairstyles, and make up.


When, we came home from our holidays, and when, I went to see Cindy, I got a big surprise,
Cindy is wearing glasses now, and she looks fantastic, 
Her new glasses wearing look, did something to me, that never had happened before, I got all wet, in my private parts.
Was it her new glasses look ?
I don't know, I had never experienced, that feeling before.
I told Cindy, that, after my eye exam, I most likely, would be wearing glasses to.
Oh, Amber, I can't wait to see you wearing glasses..
Do you realize, that glasses, are now a fashion item.


We had our eye exam, and Amy, needs to wear glasses,.
Because, Cindy, is wearing glasses now, and that, glasses are now considered a fashion item, I was now looking forward to get new glasses.
With my new -3.75 , prescription, I should be able to see everything.
The proper frame selection, for my new glasses, took me a long time, 


What, a shock, I got, when the optician, handed me my new glasses, and I put them on.
I asked her, are you sure these are my glasses?
They are to strong.
Yes, compared to your last prescription, you increased from. -1.25, to - 3.75, that will take you a few days, of wearing your glasses, to get used to the stronger prescription.
When, I looked at myself in a mirror, loved what I saw.
I love my new look, what I like, is that the lenses, show some rings, and
and depth, like real prescription glasses. 
Being stubborn, I wore my glasses all the time, and after a few days, appreciated my improved vision, and now realize, I should have worn my glasses all the time.
Now, I realize, what I have missed.


When Cindy, saw me wearing my new glasses, told me, how foolish I had been, not wearing my glasses before, you look so much nicer wearing glasses, then you do without wearing glasses.
You look so beautiful, I can't describe it, I never felt like this before, then she walked over to me, and gave me a big hug,
I hugged her, and gave her a kiss,
Off course, she wanted to try my glasses, and when she had put the glasses on, and I looked at her, I got all wet again, Cindy, looked so nice.


Starting high school, was a whole new experience for us, so many new faces.
It did not take Cindy and I, very long, to feel we belong there. 
We are good looking, young women, and love to participate, and have joined some of the clubs..
I now prefer the looks, of a guy, who wears glasses, and Cindy feels that way to.
We also, noticed, there are some beautiful, glasses wearing girls.
I always like to talk to them, to have a good look, at how they wear their make up, and what kind of lenses they have, in their glasses.
There are a few girls, who have a stronger prescription, and I love looking at the rings, on the edges of the lenses, and the mimification, of their faces, I hope, soon I will be wearing that type of lens, I love that look.


Cindy, and I are very much alike.
She seems to like the same things as I do, and talk about everything.
I told her, that I now have a new larger size bra.
I, don't believe it, so I showed her, then she wanted to try it on, and was very disappointed, that it was too big for her.
Then, we talked about some of the girls, and their glasses, and we both, now only like the looks of boys, and girls who wear glasses.


About two years later, at my eye exam, my prescription, increased some more.
and now, I am now in the -5.25 range, and love the looks, of my new lenses
Cindy's prescription, is now in the - 3.50 range, and we both, love our new stronger lenses.


Cindy and I, have had a number of dates with boys, but are not to excited about the results.
I, am very confused now, and I asked Cindy, how do you feel, about boys, because, I think, I like girls better then boys.
Amber, I am starting to feel the same way, perhaps we should go to one of the meetings, they offer at the school, about sexual feelings, that might help us.


Cindy and I, went to the meeting, to find the information about sexual relations, same sex, lesbian, gay and transgender.
When we entered the room, were surprised, to see quite a number, of familiar faces there.
We sat close to a couple of girls, we knew, one of the girls told us, that she did not know if she liked, boys better than girls, how was she going to find out?
Then we gathered in small groups, with students who felt the same as we did, and discussed our problem, while supervised by a professional, who tried to answer our questions.
We now go to the meetings regularly, and now know, we are are bi-sexual.
We still go out with boys, but also like the girly dates. 


Both Cindy, and I had another increase in our glasses prescription, and love our 
new look.
Cindy and I, both prefer to go on dates, when, the other person wears glasses,
and if they wear a stronger prescription, they are our type!
