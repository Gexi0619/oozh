I use spellcheck. Sorry if english not so good.  

Bruce Yardley was a doctor and had always dreamt of having a son to carry on the family name.
He was a handsome man who studied to become a doctor.
Because he studied so hard, he ruined his eyes and needed glasses.
He served his internship at the Wenceslaws Poltronieck Memorial hospital in Nixville where he had met and married the most beautiful of the nurses the red-headed Whitley Carruthers.
Mrs Yardley had green eyes was prone to freckles and needed glasses and they were very happy.
Doctor Yardley thought she looked fabulous in her glasses and he was very happy.
Their first child had been a girl who they named Ainsley.
Ainsley was a beautiful baby with red hair green eyes and freckles just like her mother.
“Dear” Mrs Yardley said to her husband. “You knew there was a 50% chance but statistically there’s only a 25% chance of it being a girl the next time.”
Comforted by the wise words of his wife Doctor Yardley took heart and he was very happy.

Even though Mrs Yardley was statistically correct the next time round she presented Doctor Yardley with twin girls Lilley and Lesley.
Lilley and Lesley also took after their mother and had red hair green eyes and were prone to freckles.
Even though Doctor Yardley was very happy to have three such beautiful daughters he decided that three was plenty and plenty was enough.

Ainsley, Lilley and Lesley grew up in a loving home and they were very happy.
All three of the Yardley girls had needed glasses when very young and all three of them studied as hard as their father had and ruined their eyes even more so that by the time the left High School they needed quite strong glasses and that made them even more happy.
Bruce and Whitley were very proud of their beautiful daughters as they went off to Medical school to qualify as doctors and marry handsome young doctors who also wore glasses and loved the beautiful red-headed green-eyed Yardley girls with their strong glasses.
Ainsley married a handsome doctor named Harley Oakley and they were very happy.
Lilley married a handsome doctor named Huxley Paisley and they also were very happy.
Lesley married a handsome doctor named Langley Presley and they too were very happy.

Then Doctor Yardley had a brainstorm. 
“Whitley I know you’re past 40 with grown daughters at University but dammit you’re going to give me that son of mine now.”
Mrs Yardley heartily agreed as she calculated the chance of it being yet another girl was only 1/16 or 6.67% and a son to carry on the family name would make her happy husband even more happy.
But Uncaring Fate had other ideas and grinned in their faces as the Yardleys were presented with triplets all girls.
The identical twins Cayley and Kayley took after their mother had red hair green eyes were prone to freckles and no one could ever tell them apart.
Just like their older sisters Ainsley Lilley and Lesley Cayley and Kayley needed glasses at an early age.
Luckily their myopic progression was very similar to those of their older sisters so they could wear their old glasses.
Or maybe their myopic progression was very similar to those of their older sisters because they wore their old glasses.
Anyway, they were very happy.

The fraternal twin Halley was very different from her twin sisters.
She had golden hair blue eye didn’t freckle and didn’t take after her mother.
Because she was a tomboy she was her father’s favourite and Cayley and Kayley did not like that.
“Daddy! It is not fair…”
“…that Halley doesn’t wear glasses…”
“…when we have to!”
Then Halley was very sad because she too wanted to wear glasses.
She took to wearing Ainsley’s old glasses but they were too strong for her and gave her a headache.
She then tried Lilley’s old glasses but they were even stronger and gave her a worse headache.
“Daddy! Make Halley wear…”
“…Lesley’s old glasses!”
“They are even stronger…”
“…and would make her eyes…”
“…as bad as ours…”
“…which is only fair.”
Doctor Yardley agreed and now Halley had to wear Lesley’s old glasses which were the strongest and gave her an even worse headache.

While Cayley and Kayley got stronger and stronger glasses Halley only got stronger and stronger headaches and she told her parents that it was not fair that she didn’t need glasses.
Because they loved her so much they gave Halley soft contacts lense to wear so she could wear the glasses without getting any headaches and now everyone was very happy.

Because they were beautiful redheads and wore glasses Cayley and Kayley were very popular in school. 
All the other girls wanted to try their glasses and some of the boys too.
They then went home and told their parents that they needed glasses too and the optician was very happy because he sold so many pairs glasses he could retire on the spot and buy a condo in the Bahamas and he was very happy. 
Cayley and Kayley met two nice young men Ridley and Wesley who played baseball and football.
They tried Cayley’s and Kayley’s old glasses and found that they saw so much better that they started to wear glasses themselves.
Cayley and Kayley sell lemonade together and have so much fun.
Ridley and Wesley play so much better now that they have glasses.
Cayley and Kayley are very happy they can now see Ridley and Wesley play so much better now that they have glasses.
Ridley and Wesley will be able to see Cayley and Kayley sell lemonade and have so much fun now that they have glasses.
Unfortunately groundskeeper Macauley who really needs glasses but is so poorly paid he can’t afford any did not see that Quirkley the School Bully who surprise surprise also needed glasses but was too scared to wear his had fitted a three-share plough instead of the line-painting gear.
Cayley and Kayley were horrified at what had happened to the football field.
Ridley and Wesley were also horrified at what had happened to the football field.
Even Principal McKinley was horrified at what had happened to the football field and spoke to the School about it.
Quikley felt bad about it and confessed and Principal McKinley told him he had to go to the new optician and buy himself a new pair of glasses.
When Quirkley got his new glasses he gave his old pair to groundskeeper Macauley who now saw what an awful lot of work there was to do and immediately resigned and started to brew moonshine instead which he sold by the gallon to students and everyone was very happy from then on except Halley.

Because everyone knew that Halley only wore the strongest pair of glasses of all the Yardley daughters because she wore contacts underneath she was not so popular in school.
Then Halley stopped wearing glasses even if everyone would laugh and point their fingers at her.
Halley wished that she could wear glasses an be happy just like everyone else. 
But then the myodisc fairy took pity on her and made her very nearsighted and gave her a beautiful pair of myodisc eyeglasses that Sandra Queen of Myopia had once worned.
Now Halley was the most nearsighted and most beautiful girl with the most beautiful glasses in all of Nix County and she immediately married the State Schools Captain Yardley Yardley so even Doctor Yardley was happy now that the family name would be carried on.
