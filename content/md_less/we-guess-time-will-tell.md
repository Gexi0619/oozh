We guess, time will tell.




I was six years old, when I started to wear glasses.
Believe it, or not, I think, it was the best thing, that could have happened to me.
Why?
Well, as a mature woman, I still like wearing glasses, and I have been a happy glasses wearer, ever since I was prescribed my first pair, of myopic glasses.
I love looked, through all the old pictures, of me wearing glasses, and the odd one, where I was not wearing glasses, and realize, I have always looked better, when, I was wearing glasses.


Here, is my story,


When, I was 6 years old, and ready to start school, at my yearly eye exam, I was prescribed to wear glasses, I was all excited, now I will be wearing glasses, just like all the grown ups, in our family.
My first prescription, was about - 1.25, for both eyes.
I remember, selecting a very colour full frame, that I really liked.
No, I was not upset, having to wear glasses, why should I be? 
I have seen, so many glasses wearing people, in our families, both my parents, wear glasses, my brother wears glasses, and if, I remember right, most of my aunts and uncles, wear glasses. 
At our annual, family picnic last month, I saw many of my nieces and nephews, and most, of them are wearing glasses now.


Wearing glasses, makes me feel very important. 
I love to hear people telling me, how nice, or how cute I look, wearing glasses.
That is one of the reasons, why my appearance, became very important to me, and I soon, made sure, my hair, was always looking nice, and that my glasses are clean. 


When, I started school, there was one boy, who wore glasses, with thick lenses, that made his eyes look like big bugs .
I was the only girl in my class, who wore glasses, that made me feel special, because, I had something, no other girl in my class had.
At school, I met, a very sweet, and cute girl, Megan, and we became friends. 
Megan, is the only child, of a single parent,.
When, Megan's mother has to work, Megan, is usually at our place., 
My mother does not mind, she told me, that Megan, is a very nice, and polite girl, and she can stay at our place anytime.


When, I started grade two, I was wearing a new pair, little stronger glasses, and lucky me, there was a 2 for 1 deal, so now I have two pair of nice glasses, and I can choose the pair, I like best, to go with my outfit for that day.
Wearing glasses, has always given me confidence, and I have perfect vision wearing my glasses.
I am certain, that is the reason why, I always have been a good student.


Megan, and I spend a lot of time playing together, drawing and colouring, and soon after, some painting and crafts.
I noticed, that Megan, when she draws a person, they usually are wearing glasses.
When I asked her why, she always drew people, who wear glasses, she told me, that she likes, how people look wearing glasses, and that I look so beautiful wearing glasses.
That was the only time, Megan, mentioned glasses.


We are now looking forward, to the end of the school year, and our summer vacation.
My report card was very good, poor Megan, did not do so well, however, she passed, and we will both be in grade three, after the summer break. 
I had my annual eye exam, and only had a slight increase, to about -2.75 in my prescription, which made my mother very happy.


The next day, Megan asked, me what an eye doctor does, she never had an eye exam, 
So, I tied to explain , that you have to look at some letters, on the wall, and if you cannot read them, the doctor, uses a machine, where he can change the lenses, so you can see the letters, nice and clear, that is how he makes your prescription.
I will try to show you, and I tried to make a wall chart, like the doctor uses.
I could only remember the big E, on top., so I wrote in some other letters.
Now, you have to be, this far from the letters, and if you can read them all, you don't have to wear glasses, if you cannot read them all, you have to wear glasses.
Megan, looked at the letters, are you sure that is right?
Yes, why?
Well, I cannot see the bottom 3 lines from here.
Megan, let's look out of the window, can you see the mail box down the street?
Megan, looked, where is it? Well look right there, I cannot see it, it all looks fuzzy to me.
Megan, you most likely need to wear glasses, and have an eye exam.
I don't think, my mother can afford that right now.
Here, try my glasses. when Megan put the glasses on, mentioned that the glasses were too strong, and that she could not see very well.
I remembered, that I had saved all my older glasses, and went to my dresser, and in the drawer, were the 3 glasses cases, with the glasses, and prescriptions, in each case..
When Megan, tried my first pair of glasses could not believe her eyes, everything she looked at, looked more clear,.
No wonder, you like to wear glasses, when they help you see, so much better,
I asked Megan, to again look, at the mailbox down the street, she told me she could see it but not very clear.
When Megan, put my little stronger glasses on, she could see, the mailbox nice and clear., we sat down on my bed again, and Megan, and after she had handed me back, the glasses, she had been wearing, started to cry.
I asked, why she was crying, then she told me, she would like to have glasses like that, but she did not think, her mother, could not afford them right now.
We went to see my mother, and, I told her the whole story, about Megan's vision.
Can Megan, have my old glasses?
Yes, if she can use them, but I think we should be on the safe side, I think, Megan, should have an eye exam, which, is paid for on our provincial health plan, 
I would like to take her, and talk to Dr..Jones. I think, she can wear the glasses in the meantime, but I like to talk, with Megan's mother fist.


The following week, we went to see Dr. Jones, and Megan, had her first eye exam.
Her prescription was, for - 1.75 lenses, which is the same, as the prescription was for my second pair of glasses, the ones Megan is wearing now,
Dr. Jones, after checking the glasses, against Megan's prescription, assured us, that, the difference in the prescriptions, was so minor, that it was O.K. for Megan to wear the glasses.
Now Megan, wears the glasses, all day, and loves her improved vision, and loves wearing glasses. 
After Megan, started to wear glasses, her grades really improved.
When we were, starting high School, our prescriptions, were almost identical, my prescription now is -4.75, Megan's, -4.25.
Because, we both are good looking girls, we have lots of dates, and are popular, We did not let, the dating interfere with our studies, and we both graduated with honours.
Megan went to college, to become an optician, so she will have, a decent paycheck, to help her mother.
I want to be an optometrist, and started my pre med course.
Both Megan and I studied hard, to get good marks., and of course, our glasses prescription increased.
When Megan graduated, her prescription read -6.25, and she soon, had a good job, and she enjoys her work.
By the time, I had finished my studies, to be a Doctor of optometry, my prescription, was up, to -7,50, and I don't expect the prescription, to increase much more. 


With my parents help. I bought an optical store, from an owner who retired, so I had a going business.
Megan, came to work with me, and we enjoyed working together.
We made a great team.
My boy friend, an optometrist, who I had met, at university, joined our optical business, after we got married, just as well, because, I became pregnant a short time after.
Megan, who had married, a high school friend, became pregnant about the same time.
Now we had, really something to look forward to.


Because, our optical business was still growing, and Megan, and me going to have babies, we hired another optometrist, and an optician.




10 years later.


My husband , and I, now, have a family, of two girls, Sarah, and Amy, and their younger brother Shawn.
Because, myopia, runs in both my husband and my families, we expect that our children, most likely, will be myopic.
We have analyzed our families, and it seems, that the new generation, is usually more myopic, then their parents were at that age.
I know, my prescription, is now higher than my parents, and we wonder, are we going to have children, that are high myopic ?



Sarah, started to wear glasses for myopia, when she was 5, and now at the age of 9, in the third grade at school, wears -3.25 glasses.
Amy, started to wear glasses when she went to grade 1, her prescription, is - 1.50 .Shawn, who is now 5 yrs old, just started to wear glasses
Megan's two girls, age 9, and 7 both wear glasses, for myopia, with prescriptions, of -3.50. and - 2.25.
We haven noticed, that, most of their prescriptions, are higher than mine, my husband, and Megan's, prescriptions were at their age.
When we mentioned it, to one of our professors from university, he is now making a study of it, and using all our information.


About 15 years later, our optical, business had grown, to be the number one place to get your eyes examined, and buy your glasses, in our city.
Our children, and Megan's children, are in their early twenties now, and their prescriptions, are a half to two diopters higher, then ours, at their age.
Now, we wonder, what is going to happen, to our grand children's vision
We guess, time will tell.
