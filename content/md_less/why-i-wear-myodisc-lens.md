I do not remember much about my sister and my early years
But my mother has recently died and while sorting through her papers I found a diary 
I was very angry when I read it.
I won't bother you with the early entries.

Amber is 6 years old today (That's me ) she is doing very well at school.

We are very worried about Mary she will be 4 soon  (that's my baby sister) she is very slow to learn things and is very clumsy. 

Just got back from the hospital Mary needs glasses and hearing aids 

Glasses are ready doctor said they -1.75 in both eyes.

Mary won't wear her glasses and keeps pulling her hearing aids out.

Mary was screaming because she had to go for  6 months eye check up.
I took both girls. Mary needed stronger glasses -2.25 ,but Ambers sight was perfect.

Mary throwing a tantrum because Amber doesn't wear glasses and hearing Aids.

Can't cope with the problems so I copied Marys prescription and ordered  a new pair for her and a matching pair for Amber

Went to the hospital with Mary and told them she had lost her hearing aids so they gave me a replacement pair.

Glasses arrived.I Told  Amber doctor had rung and said they had made a mistake and she needed glasses as well as Mary.

Mary excited to see Amber wearing glasses today kept hers on all day. But threw her hearing aids out.

Amber complaint she can't see so well with the glasses on.told her it takes a few days to get used to them.Its the school holiday so I hope Amber used to them before school starts again

Mary still not wearing her hearing aids. Decided to tell Amber she has to wearing hearing aids now like Mary.

Mary wearing her hearing aids now but Amber complaining.

Told Amber I will buy her a iPad if she wears her hearing Aids 

Peace now.both girls wearing glasses and hearing Aids
And Amber happy with her iPad.

School starts today Amber complains about having to wear glasses and hearing aids to school says she still can't see as well wearing them .but I remind her about her iPad.

All Ambers school friend surprised to see her wearing glasses and hearing aids.they all want to try them.

Amber enjoyed all the attention she got.

Peace again.

Mary's 6 month check up. Took her while Amber at school.
Needed stronger lens - 3.25 with 2 out prism.

Ordered new glasses online for both girls  with Marys new prescription.

The girls like the new frames I choose for ,both of them
Mary can see much better now but Amber complaining they are pulling her eyes but I tell her she soon get used to them.

Mary starts school but fails the hearing test.

Took Mary to hospital she gets stronger hearing aids 

Mary complaining that her new hearing aids are bigger why has Amber not got big ones as well.

Amber complains that her phone not working. 

Says if she can have a new iPhone she will wear big hearing aids like Mary.

Give Amber the large hearing aids and bought her a new iPhone 

Took Mary to the hospital and told them she had lost the new hearing aids.they were not pleased but gave her new ones.

Mary's test due again tomorrow 

Her eyes have got worse again. R-4.00 L 3.75 prism 3 out 

Ordered 2 pair from Internet again

Optical store rings Ambers glasses are ready 

Amber was veryyy angry when she saw them both lens have 28ml circles in the middle, they had not told her that they were giving her Myodisc lens 
And a separate pair of reading glasses.

Amber has left home not seen her for  3 years .

Doctor says I have 3 months to live.
I wanted to say sorry to her for ruining her eyesight and hearing by making her wear glasses and hearing aids 

Today will be the first time I will see Mary since I left home  I had second ear implant last year.
My eyesight has continued to get worse my last prescription was R -28.75 -4.75 180  L -25.75 -3.75 180  Add 5.00

My reading glasses that I wear on a cord around my neck have 20 out prisms in each eye.
I am registered partially sighted.
But I can still drive as I have bioptic lens fitted to my driving glasses.

I looked everywhere for Mary but I Couldn't see her.
Then Heard a voice behind me.
“Hi Amber it's me Mary don't you recognise me”
“I had lasik eye surgery last year I don't need glasses now,and look I have these tiny hearing aids that go right inside my ears so nobody knows I'm deaf we don't have much money so we had to save for the operation 
“Poor you having to wear those strange glasses and such big hearing aids I wonder why you have such poor eyesight”

I did not stay after the funeral as my husband was picking me up.
He has a glasses fetish and wear GOC 
So I was the Perfect wife for him he love to wear my glasses sometimes.
