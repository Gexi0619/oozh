Be happy, with who you are.


June, is L. B. G. T. month important, for some members, of our V & S community.


We are the proud parents, of two sets of mixed twins, Peter and Robin,
They are now in grade 1, Megan, and Brandon, who are not quite 5 years old. 
There is one thing about, having mixed twins, you always know, who, is who.
I always have my hands full, however, with the good husband I have. to help me out, we have a happy household.
My husband Jim, who I met in college, is a good looking, glasses wearing man, he is hyperopic , and I love his, glasses wearing look, showing his nice brown eyes.
I, Anne, a dark blonde, medium build woman, wears glasses, I am myopic, in the -5.00 range, who has always, loved wearing glasses.
Because, both Jim and I wear glasses, eye care, and regular eye exams, are a must.
Starting at a young age, we had our children, wear their sun glasses, most of the time, when playing outside.


Our first set of twins Peter and Robin, are now are seven years old, and after the summer, will be going into, grade 2.
When Megan, and Brandon, will be starting kindergarten, after the summer, the house sure will be quit after school starts.


I have noticed, that Brandon, behaves so differently, then Peter, did at his age. 
He likes playing with dolls, instead of trucks, likes to wear his sisters clothes, does not want his hair cut, and has told me, many, many times, that he is a girl.
I discussed it, with my husband, and our doctor, and both of them, thought it was just a phase, that Brandon most likely will grow out off, when he gets older.
.
To morrow, eye exams.


Going into the optical store for their yearly eye exams, is always a lot of fun, for the children, they like trying different frames, to see how they look, while waiting for their eye exam.
Robin, was first, and the doctor, told me, it looks like, she most likely will be myopic, but is not quite ready for glasses, right now
Next was Peter, and I was really surprised, when the doctor told me, that Peter is hyperopic, has some astigmatism, and will have to wear glasses full time. 
Megan and Brandon, have no vision problems.
I think Peter enjoyed the fact, he was the only one, who needs to wear glasses, and had a great time, selecting a frame,


The next day, all of us went, to collect, Peter's new glasses.
While Peter, had his glasses fitted, Robin was wearing a glasses frame, that she told me , she just loved, and could she get the glasses now?
I told her, not right now, you might be prescribed to wear glasses, at the next eye exam, and then, we will select a frame, that you will really like. 
Peter, is now wearing his glasses, he look's so cute, I love the way he looks. 


Brandon, keeps on telling me, he is a girl, and his hair is getting longer, because he does not wants his hair cut, he wants long hair.
Because of Brandon's behaviour, I, wanted to find out more, about transgenders. 
After spending some time reading about, transgenders, on the internet, have decided, we need professional help.
We went, to have Brandon examined, by some specialists.
After, what seemed like forever, the doctors came to talk to us. 
All the people that were involved, and had talked, to Brandon, had came to the conclusion, that Brandon, is transgender, and for his own good, should be accepted as a girl, as soon as possible. 
The experts suggested ,we do it right away, before school starts, so he would avoid having any mental distress. that way, he will be accepted as a girl, and that, will be the best for him.
My husband and I discussed it, and decided, to let Brandon, be a girl.
When, we told our other children, that Brandon will be a girl now, and to help him,, they decided, his name should be Brenda,.
Brandon liked that name, and soon was dressed like a girl, and now I have a set of identical looking twins, after I had their hair styled the same.




The optometrist, had mentioned to me, that she was sure, Robin was going to be myopic, and it happened, about five months later. when Robin, started to complain, about headaches, and I noticed, now is squinting a lot, and holding her reading material very close to her eyes, all the signs, that she needs to wear glasses.
I made an appointment, for an eye exam.
The optometrist was surprised, she had not expected, Robin, to need a prescription, 
of -0.75, and -1.00 , this quickly, since her last eye exam, which was only about five months ago.
The optometrist told me, that she would like to see Robin, again in about six months.
Robin, is so happy, now she can have the glasses frame, that she really likes.


The next day, when Robin started to wear her new glasses, and she kept telling me that everything was so nice and clear, and that she could see everything now. 
I remember, I had the same experience, when I started to wear glasses.
When she came home, every body, told her, how nice she looked, wearing the glasses.
They all, wanted to try her glasses, and find out, what they could see, and how they looked, wearing the glasses.
Both, Peter and Robin, wear their glasses all the time, and do not mind, having to wear glasses..


I wonder, will all my children, end up having to wear glasses?
I have mixed feelings about that, they look so nice and cute wearing glasses, but they, also, will be wearing glasses, for the rest of their lives.
Well, there is nothing, I can do about it, let nature take its course.


Now, I send three girls and a boy to school, and my husband and I, are pleasantly surprised, how well Brenda, was fitting in as a girl, and getting along with all her friends. 


Time flies by, and the end of the school year, is here.
We have made some plans, for the summer, where we like to go camping on long weekends, and when my husband has his holidays.
Megan, and Brenda, have been invited, for a weeks stay, with my sister, Kimberly, who lives on a farm, and has two children about their age.


It is Saturday, and we all go, for the long drive, to take Megan, and Brenda to the farm, of uncle Peter, and aunt Kimberly.
When we arrived there, it was raining, so we had to stay in the house, and had nice visit.
Their son Ricky, and daughter Amie, are about the same age, as Brenda, and Megan.
are wearing glasses now.
When I asked Kim, she told me, that they had started, to wear glasses, about a year ago, and after their last weeks eye exam, are now wearing their second pair. 
Well, it seems myopia, runs in our family.
Kimberly agrees, her prescription is now in the -10.00 range, and her husband Peter is in the - 4.00 range.
Thank goodness, the weather cleared, when we were driving home, which made the ride home, more pleasant.


The following Sunday, my sister Kimberly, brought Megan and Brenda home.
When they all, got out of the car, I noticed, both of my children were wearing glasses.
Mom, we love wearing these glasses, Ricky, and Amy don't need these glasses anymore, and they gave us the glasses, so you won't have to buy us any.
What to do?
When I ashed Kimberly, why she allowed the children wear the glasses, she told me both pair, have a prescription, of less then -1.00, if I remember right, -0.50 and -0.75.



After Kimberly and her children had left, I talked with my husband about, Megan and Brenda, wearing the glasses.
He suggested, they both should have their eyes examined, as soon as possible.
Megan and Brenda, kept wearing the glasses, and I asked them, when they had started, wearing the glasses, then, they told me their story.
Because it was raining, and they could not go outside, to play, they went up to their bedrooms, and there were some glasses lying on the dresser.
When they had asked about the glasses, Ricky had told them, they could not touch the glasses,..
Then, Ricky, started to play eye doctor, and both were prescribed to wear glasses, and we have worn the glasses since.
Robin, tried both pair of glasses, and told me that the lenses were certainly not as strong as hers.
I had a close look, at the glasses, and the lenses looked to me about -0,50, at the most 
-0.75, as Kimberly had told me.
I mentioned to my husband, what I thought, the prescription of the lenses was.
What shall we do? 
I told him, that Robin, had tried both of the glasses, and had told me, the lenses were not as strong, as in her glasses.
Well, they have worn those glasses, for a whole week now, I think a couple of days more, won't hurt them.
So that night at mealtime, all of us were wearing glasses. 


The next day, when I phoned the optical store, could not get an appointment, till the following week. 
What to do now?
I got an idea, and looked up the Snellen chart, on the computer, and instructions, on how to check the children's vision.
The next day, both Megan and Brenda, told me, they could not find their glasses.
Yes, I know, because I have them, and I would like to find out, how well you can see, without wearing glasses.
I had made up something, that resembled the Snellen chart, and figured out the distance,
to see, which letters, they were able to read..
I could not believe, the trouble they had, reading the letters, which they know, because they both love reading. 
When, they put their glasses on, both of them, had no trouble reading each letter.
and now, I realize, that both of them, are myopic, we will find out for sure, when they have their eye exam next week.
After they had their eye exam, the optometrist told me, their prescription, is almost identical, as in the glasses, they have been wearing.
I loved it, that after they both selected the same glasses frame, and now, with the same hairstyle, and glasses, sure look like identical twins.

About 15 years later


Peter, and Robin, are now in university.
Peter's prescription, has not changed much, he wears +5.00 glasses, and looks fantastic.
Robins prescription has climbed steadily, and she now wears, - 9,00 glasses, and looks to me, like model.
Megan, and Brenda, decided to go to business college, their glasses prescription, 
is in the, - 7.00 range..
Brenda, after using puberty blocking hormones, and then female hormones, is now a beautiful looking female, and very happy with her life, and looking forward, to the big operation, to make her a complete female.


Pete came home for the weekend, to introduce his boyfriend, to us.
We, had a suspicion, that he might be gay, because, he had never paid much attention to girls..
We welcomed his friend, and accepted the fact that he was gay, and that you are who you are, and make the best of it.


Brenda, had her operation, and now, has a steady girl friend, they live in an apartment, and both have a good job.


Megan, and Robin, are now married, and Robin, is pregnant, and I am looking forward to a grandchild .


We are very proud of our happy family, and have many nice family gatherings, including some gay and lesbian friends, we know,that, you are who you are, and live your life, and be happy.
