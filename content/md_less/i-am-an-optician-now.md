I am, an optician now.


My name, is Ashley, I am a well build, average height, country girl.
My hair, is a light brown color, with a bit of natural curl, and I have brown eyes..
I live on a farm, I have two older brothers, who work with my dad on the farm.
I recently graduated from high school, with honors, and like to do something with my life, but I don t know what.
There is not much to do around here, except help my mother, with the house work.
Because, it is difficult, to find good jobs, in the area, where we live, my parents suggested, I should try, to get a job, in the city.
Aunt Margaret, a widow, and her son, live in a city, and, after my mother talked to her, has invited me to stay at her place, and get a job, so I can save some money, and find out what the real world is all about.
To day, my dad drove me to a near by village, and catch the bus, to go the city, where my aunt lives.


When, I arrived at the bus station, in the city, a tall, very good looking, glasses wearing man, 
was carrying a sign, I am looking for Ashley.
When, I approached him, he introduced himself, I am David, your aunt Margaret s, son. and after collecting my suitcases, walked me to his car.
Being a country girl, I had never seen traffic like this, I just could not believe it,
people, cars, pedestrians, it seems like people, and cars everywhere.
I was so busy watching everything, that before I knew it, David drove into a driveway, of a nice home, with a nice garden.
Well, here is your new home, let s go in.
When I saw my aunt, she gave me a big hug, and said I am so glad to see you Ashley, and invited me into her kitchen.
We sat down, enjoying a cup of tea, and a sandwich.
Now, I had a chance, to have a good look at my aunt, she sure does not look like my mother.
Aunt Margaret has more gray, in her hair, and she wears glasses, I think, she looks beautiful.
David, her son, wears glasses to, but the lenses in his glasses, I noticed, look different then my aunt s.
My aunts lenses, make her eyes look a little larger, David s lenses, make his eyes look a little smaller.
Nobody, in our family, wears glasses, and not knowing, anything about glasses, I wondered, why I had noticed.
Aunt Margaret told me that David, is going to university, to become a doctor of optometry,
and when, classes start again, in a couple of weeks, he will be starting his final year.
After lunch, David left, to go to his summer job, at the optical store.
Aunt Margaret, spend time with me, to make me feel at home.


The next day, my aunt, showed me some of the city, and took me to a shopping mall.
I had never seen anything like it before, one store next to another, and all indoors.
For lunch, we went to a food court, all those different choices of meals, in one area, I liked that.
After we were seated, and had started to eat, David joined us.
He works, at the optical store, across from the mall, and after we finished our meal, we went with him, 
so he could show us, where he worked.
I could not believe my eyes, when we walked, into the optical store.
All those glasses on display, desks, where people would be seated, when getting their glasses.
How many people, needed to wear glasses, to keep a store like this busy, I am all confused. 
On the school bus, at home. there were only four students, who wore glasses.
David, showed me some frames, and asked me, if I would like to try some.
Wondering, what I would look like wearing glasses, said, that I sure would like to try some, to see what I would look like wearing glasses.
After trying some frames, that David had suggested, I could not believe, how different I looked wearing glasses.
There was one frame, a brown colored, with some lighter little marks, that I really thought looked good on me, but, I don t need to wear glasses.


That night, in bed, thinking about everything, came to the conclusion, that I had never realized, how many people, must be wearing glasses.
Thinking, about trying the glasses, and seeing, how good I looked wearing them, made me wonder, would I mind, having to wear glasses?


The next day, I asked David, that since, I know so little about vision and glasses, if he could explain to me, why the lenses in his glasses, looked so different from the lenses, in his mothers glasses.
He explained to me, about myopia, and hyperopia, and why people need to wear glasses.
Now, I have a better idea, why people, wear glasses.
David, asked me, if I ever had an eye exam, and I told him that I had not, and I have no idea, how they do that.
Well, Ashley, if you are interested to find out, let me know.
Yes, I would be, I never knew anything about glasses and vision, until I came here.
I never had tried glasses before, until the other day, at the optical store.
Now, I am starting to find, glasses, and vision, a very fascinating, and interesting subject, that I think, I certainly would like to know more about.
Ashley, what was your strongest subject in high school?
Science, and math, were my best subjects.
Well, David said, that gives me an idea, and will see, what I can do to help you.


A couple of days later, David told me that, the owner of the optical store had suggested, since you would like to know more about, vision and glasses, you can come with me to the store, so I can show you around, then you can see, all the procedures required, to look after people, who need to wear glasses.
You can come with me to morrow morning.
Oh, David, thank you, that sounds terrific, I love to come.


The following morning, I made sure, that I looked my best, and after breakfast, aunt Margaret, 
on the way out, gave me a big hug, and told me to have a good day.
When we arrived at the optical store, David s boss, Dr, Jones, an optometrist, greeted me and invited me into his office.
He asked me a lot of a questions, and then said, I understand, you never had an eye exam.
Well, I am an optometrist, and if you like, I can give you an eye exam now, before we get busy, so you can experience, what an eye exam is like..
Thank you, I would like that very much, I really like to find out how the exam is done.
Well, Ashley, follow me.
He asked me to sit down, look into this, while you look at the picture, the autorefractor, prints out a guideline of the patients prescription, next I had a puff of air hit my eyes, the tonometer, measures the eye pressure, to check for glaucoma.
Then we went to the examination room, where the doctor, checked the health of my eyes,.by shining a bright light into my eyes while he looked, with a type of magnifying glass.
After that, he put what he called, the phoropter, in front of my eyes.
I had to read the letters, first with my right and then with my left eye, and when the letters were not clear, I heard a little click, and that made them clear, so I could read them.
Then he kept asking me, which is better, I or 2 then 3 or 4, and so on.
When he was finished, told me I had healthy eyes, but I am a low myopic, and should wear glasses.
Then he showed me, the difference in my vision, when wearing glasses, and when not wearing glasses..
I sure was surprised, when the Doctor told me, I have to wear glasses, I had always been sure, that my vision was perfect, until the doctor showed me, that it was not,


The next surprise came, when he asked me, if I would like a job, at the optical store.
You will be the assistant to the optician, and assist, in pre exam procedures, assist customers selecting frames for their glasses, and help out when and where needed.
Well, I certainly, would like to work here,.it is so interesting, I like to take the job.
Ashley, I am glad, you accept, I think you are smart, and I am sure, you will do a good job for us
One of the benefits of working here, is we give you a free pair of glasses, once a year.
See David, since he is taking the place of the optician, who is on holidays, he will look after you, and will get the necessary measurements, for your glasses.


When I found David, I told him, I will be working here, and that the Dr. Jones after the exam had told me, I should be wearing glasses, then I handed him, my prescription.
He showed me how to read it, O.D right eye, - 0.75, O.S. left eye -0.50, and some astigmatism.
After selecting the frame, that I really liked, he took some measurements, and asked me to come with him to the lab.
The technician, showed me how he made up the lenses, polished them, and put the lenses in the frame.
An hour later, I was wearing my new glasses, and I can t believe the improvement in my vision, I love my new look and the glasses are so comfortable to wear.
The rest of the day, I slowly found my way around, and what I really enjoyed, was when I assisted some customers, with their glasses selection.
I was all excited on the way home, new glasses, and a job, I know I am going to love.
Aunt Margaret, was surprised, when she saw me wearing glasses, and told me how nice I looked.
I of course, had to tell her everything, what had happened that day, and how excited I am, because I know, I now have a job, that I am sure, will like very much.


The next few days, David showed me, before he went back to university, and the optician returned from her holidays, what was expected of me.
I soon developed a routine, and I made sure, all the displays, and desks were neat and clean.
At home at night, I spend a lot of time on the computer, learning more about vision and glasses.


The optician, Ann, is, a very personable, glasses wearing, older lady, and does what ever she can, to help me, and I can ask her any question, and she sure is a good teacher.


Since the university, that David, attends, is in the city, he would be home most nights, for supper.
To night, he asked me, if I would like to become an optician.
Yes, I certainly would, but I have to save my money first, so I can afford to go to college.
He handed me some information, regarding, the course to become an optician.
The course offered is 2 years full time study, or an on line course, with one day, and one night, a week practical lessons, at the university, and it takes about 3 years, to complete the course, depending on the student..
The thought, of becoming an optician, really appealed to me, the part time course sounded just great. 


When, I talked to Dr. Jones, he did not see any reason, why I should not register for the course,
we can arrange your schedule, as needed.
It did not take me long to get into a steady routine, of working during the day, and studying at night.
When I went for my practical day, at the college, I first, had to write a test, of what I had studied on line, the previous week.
All the hard work, was well worth it, I enjoy the course, and have high marks, on my tests.
At the same time, I have the opportunity, to meet some young people my own age.


With all my studying I have been doing lately, I also have more headaches.
When, Dr. Jones heard about it, suggested, I have an other eye exam, my last exam, was more then 6 months ago, and I might need an increase, in my prescription.
Dr. Jones was right, I had an increase, of ½ diopter, for each eye.
Now, that I am able, to do some of the lab work, and with the help, of Peter, the technician, it did not take long, to have new lenses in my glasses.
The new lenses look great, I love the look of the stronger lenses, and wonder, how many more increases, I will have, before my prescription levels off.
I can t believe it, that now I am looking forward to getting stronger lenses, and realize, that now I love the looks of stronger lenses that show rings, and some depth.


To day, I went to the lab, to check on an order, when Peter, our lab technician, just finished a pair
of glasses.
Are these the glasses, that you are looking for, and handed me the glasses he just had finished.
I had a close look at the glasses, a half rim frame, with myopic lenses.
First thing I noticed, was the thickness of the edges of the lenses.
Being curious I held the glasses up, and looked through the lenses, wow, they looked strong.
Having another good look at the front of the glasses, loved the look of the rings and depth of the lenses.
When, I checked the name on the order, realized that they were the glasses, I was looking for.
Yes, Peter, thank you, the glasses look fantastic, you sure did a great job.
When, I came back to the sales area, I went to the counter, to find a case, and cleaning cloth, then sat down at a desk, and while I cleaned the glasses, had a look at the prescription, O D – 7.50, O S -7.00. 
I could not resist the temptation, I took my glasses off, and put the clean glasses on,.
I could not see to well, wearing the glasses, but when looking at myself, in the mirror, loved the look of the lenses, the depth, made my eyes looked smaller, and lots of rings, I am wishing, these glasses were mine.
Not any to soon, I took the glasses off, and had put them in the case, when a glasses wearing, well groomed, handsome, young man came over, and asked me, if the glasses for Logan Kirk were ready.
Yes, they are right here, Mr. Kirk, please sit down.
He sat down, I opened the glasses case, and handed him the glasses.
He looked at them, and said they look fantastic, and after removing his glasses put them on.
When I looked at him, wearing the glasses, experienced a feeling, I never had before in my life.
Logan Kirk, looked so unbelievable fantastic.
I told him how fantastic he looked, and how I loved the look of his lenses, that seemed to please him
enough, that he asked me if he could buy me a coffee.
When, I told him, I could not leave till closing at six, he said well, then we will have to go for dinner,
I will be in the parking lot, at 6 o, clock, and I will be looking for you.


I was so excited, a date, with a handsome glasses wearing man.
Next, I phoned my aunt, to tell her why I would not be home till later, so she would not worry.
At 6, I was ready, and walked over to the parking lot, and there was Logan waiting for me.
He sure treated me like a lady, the way he got me seated in his car.
When we arrived at a nice restaurant, and we were seated at a table, it did not take us long, to find out more about each other.
Logan, works with his dad at the family business, he has two younger sisters, who are myopic, like their mother, so now they all wear glasses.
Logan started to wear glasses, in grade 3, and has always loved wearing glasses, and is so happy with his new glasses, that show depth, and a lot of rings.
We had a lovely evening, and arranged to meet again, I think, I am in love with the guy.
Now, I am hoping, that at my next eye exam, my prescription will go up, we both love strong looking lenses.


A couple of days later, a very attractive, red haired, young lady, came to pick up her glasses.
I really liked the frame she was wearing. 
The 2 pair of new glasses, she had bought, were, – 4.25 , a little stronger then her old ones.
She was so pleased, with her new glasses, said here, I don t want the old ones any more.
I was shocked, I did not know what to do, with the glasses.
After she left, I took the glasses, and checked the prescription, on the lenso meter, and realized the prescription, was about a diopter stronger than mine.
I put the glasses in my pocket, I wanted them.
On the way home, I tried the glasses, and was surprised, how well I could see when wearing them.
In my bedroom, that night, I looked at myself in the mirror, wearing the glasses, and loved the look of the stronger lenses, and started to wear the glasses, as much as I could.


At my next date with Logan, I wore my new stronger glasses, he noticed right away, and told me how he liked them.
Then I told him the story of the glasses, he suggested that, when I get a new prescription, to make them stronger, than prescribed.
To make sure, that I have time to study, Logan suggested, we only date on weekends.


Time goes fast, I am now ready for my final exams, to become a certified optician.
I past all my exams, with high marks, and I enjoyed the graduation, and receiving my diploma.
Logan, and aunt Margaret, and David were there, and all are very proud of me.
Not long after, Logan, asked me to marry him, and I accepted
The following weekend, Logan and I went to the farm, so I could introduce Logan, to my family.
I also, wanted to thank my parents, for their help, to better myself when they suggested, to find find a job in the city.
Thanks to them, I am, an optician now.
