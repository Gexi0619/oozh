After the eye exam the optometrist told Amy s mother , that Amy was myopic and should wear glasses.
Is there no operation to fix it?
No , she is to young for an operation , and her eyes will most likely change some more while she is still growing.
What about contact lenses ?
I would like to see her in about 6 months , check her prescription and then we can look at contact lenses.
After selecting a frame , and taking measurements,  Amy and her mother went to the mall.
Amy s mother was in a dad mood.
I don t want you to wear your glasses when we have company.
I don t want people to know you wear glasses, just wear them at school and driving.

Amy was very happy with her new glasses and she would like to be able to wear them all day, but could not if she wanted to keep peace in the family.
She made an effort not to wear them when her mother was around.

Amy received a call from her modelling agency asking her , if she would be able to participate in a fashion show at the Mall the following Saturday
She accepted, it always was fun , and she had not done any shows for a while.

When she arrived at the show area in the mall, was greeted by the show chair .
Amy , you look fantastic , I love your glasses , I did not know you wore them.
Are you going to wear them during the show ?
If you want me to.
Yes , I would like you to wear your glasses, the theme of the show is  THE NEW LOOK , glasses are a big part og the new look and are fashionable now.
Amy was glad  she could wear her glasses, they made her feel confident .
The show was a big success, and everybody was happy.

After the show , a representative of an optical firm, who was so impressed with Amy s looks and performance, came to see her.
He asked her if she would be interested to model Glasses for his company.
We would like to use pictures of you wearing glasses in our advertising .
We also would like you to model different styles of our glasses at trade shows.
Amy told him she would love to, but first would have to talk to her parents.
I will give them a call.
After Amy explained everything  to her dad , he suggested the rep. come home with her so he could talk to him.about it.
She told the rep. her father wanted to talk to him, and he agreed to meet at their house.
Amy was all excited, she was sure her mother would have a fit, but she was sure her dad  would agree.
The meeting went well, her father was agreeable, but insisted it would not interfere with he schooling.
The rep told him that was no problem.

A,my s mother was very confused now. 
Her daughters pictures would be everywhere, so everybody would know she wore glasses.
Slowly she came to the conclusion , that it was her daughters beautiful looks , and she had to admit she looked very nice wearing glasses.
She told Amy , she had decided that she could wear her glasses all the time now, if she wanted to.

A few weeks later Amy had her first photo shoot, to be used for brochures and adverting.
The pictures turned out very good and the photographer gave her copies for her portfolio.

When she can
me home , she was all excited , said Mom come here I will show you all the pictures.
Her mother sat down with her , and put on a pair of glasses, so she could see  the pictures better.
MOM you wear glasses now ?
Yes I noticed I had trouble reading  and went for an eye exam.
Now wearing glasses , I understand what a difference glasses make in your vision as well as your looks.
Your father wants me to wear the glasses all the time, he thinks I look terrific.
Now  I know that there is no shame having to wear glasses.
