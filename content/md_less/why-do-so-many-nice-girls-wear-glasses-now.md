Why do so many nice girls, wear glasses now?




Tom, is my name. I am going into my third year of high school, and I am looking forward to it.
I play on the football team, and last year I had two opportunities to play quarterback, after our team had a big lead in the score, to show my abilities.
I sure would love to be the regular quarterback, it sure helps your popularity, but I will have to wait and see, what the coach thinks.
I think, I am very good looking, and if I get a chance to be the quarterback, I know I can date almost any girl I want.


School has started, and looking around, I am really sorry to see so many good looking girls, are wearing glasses now, why?
I don’t like the looks of glasses, and won’t date a glasses wearing girl, I am not like some of the guys, they don’t seem to care, and I even heard that some prefer a girl who wears glasses.
I like a girl who is real good looking, with a nice figure and beautiful hair.


I got my wish, I am the starting quarterback on our team now,
At our school dances, I have no problems, every girl I , has danced with me, but I just cannot find the girl of my dreams.
When the dance was almost finished, I spotted a real nice looking girl, I had not noticed before, I asked her for a dance, and I really enjoyed dancing with her.
I asked her if she would like to go for a snack after the dance, and she said yes, I love to.
We went to the food court at the mall, and I really enjoyed looking at her, it was a real treat.
She seemed a bit uncomfortable, and before we had finished our snacks, she asked me to excuse her she had to go to the bathroom.
When she came back, I could hardly recognize her, of all things, she was wearing glasses.
She sat down and said, sorry I had to go, but I could not stand my contacts any longer, they were driving me crazy. 
Just what I needed, and I had thought I found the perfect girl.
I just started to wear glasses, and wanted to try contact lenses, and I now realize, I don’t like them, I don’t really mind wearing glasses, because I sure appreciate, my improved vision, when wearing my glasses, and start to like the way I look wearing glasses.
What could I say, I was so upset, can I ever find the right girl?
When looking at her glasses wearing face, I realized she did not look to bad, wearing glasses.
I walked her home, but could not bring myself to kiss her good night.


I am really upset, here I am the quarterback of our football team, and I cannot get a date with the kind of girl, that I am looking for.
Perhaps it is because our team is not doing as well this year, and I am not as popular.
Well I am in my last year of high school, and might as well wait, I most likely, will have a better chance when I go to college.


My mother, who was aware of my wanting a nice girlfriend, suggested I go to the young peoples group at our church, so I went, there were some pleasant girls there, but all the nice personable girls seemed to wear glasses, which as you know turns me off.


I have started my college courses, and so far have not had any luck, here more than half the girls wear glasses, are people that blind?
When I got in my final year, I met Ashley, the kind of girl I had always dreamed about.
We got along well, and spend as much time together as we could, and started to make plans for after our graduation.
I am studying very hard, because the better marks, might help me, to get a better job.
Some nights I am having a headache now, to much studying.
Both Ashley and I were very lucky to be hired for good positions, just before we graduated, 
all our hard work was well worth it.
Not long after we were married.
We both worked to save some money, before we were to start a family.
Once and a while we go out at night, and I find driving at night more difficult lately.
I seemed to have some trouble noticing road signs in time, I sometimes think, that they can’t afford, 
to provide more clear road signs.
Ashley, has commented a few times, that she does not like my driving, and wonders if I have a vision problem.
I told her my vision is just fine, it is the lighting and clarity of the signs, that are my problem.


On night, we went to see a movie, and on the way home, some stupid guy did not slow down, just when I was entering the intersection.
We collided, he sure plowed into the front of my car.
Luckily, nobody was injured, but a lot of damage to both cars.
When the police came, I received a ticket for not obeying a yield sign.
I was sure there was no sign, or it was very dirty, so I could not see it.
As a result of the accident, I had to go to court, and face the charge.
When I told the judge why the accident had happened, he smiled and gave me a fine, and told me, he suspended my license, until I passed the vision test, at the drivers license office.
Well that was not to bad, I will go to the license office to morrow, I should have no problem with the vision test, to get my license back.


After entering the office, a very pleasant glasses wearing lady, asked me to read some lines.
When I told her the letters were not clear enough, she told me I should not have any trouble reading them, when I came back wearing glasses.
I told her I don’t wear glasses, so she said, I am sorry sir, but what we try to tell you, you need to have your eyes examined, because you should be wearing glasses.
Was I mad when I left the office, I can see just fine, I don’t need to wear glasses.


When I came home and told Ashley, she said I am not surprised, I suspected your vision gave you trouble, I will make an appointment for you.
I am still sure everybody is wrong, I can see just fine, and won’t need glasses.


At the eye exam, after some preliminaries, I went into the examination room.
After I was seated, the doctor asked me if I had noticed any vision problems.
I told her my vision was fine, I noticed the doctor smiling.
Then she shone a bright light in my eyes, and then said, well your eyes are healthy.
She put, what looked like over sized glasses, in front of my face, and asked me to read some letters.
When I got to the next line, I told her the letters were a little fuzzy, what about now she asked, and I heard some clicks, so I told her that was better, and after a while she asked me to read the next line,
and I had no problem.
Sir, you are myopic, and have some astigmatism, you should be wearing glasses.
Then she showed me ,why I need to wear glasses, I could not believe it.
After she gave me my prescription, I walked back into the store, where a glasses wearing lady , asked me to sit down, took my prescription, and read it.
Then she escorted me to a rack full of glasses, and looked at me and handed me a pair, and asked me if I would like to try them, after I put them on, and looking at myself wearing glasses, could not believe how different I looked, and after trying a few different pairs realized, I look not bad wearing glasses.
When, at last I decided on a pair that I thought, looked good on me, she asked me to come and sit down.
While sitting there I had a good look at her, and realized, even when wearing glasses, she looked beautiful.
When I told her, she took her glasses off, and then put them back on again, I could not believe that somebody’s look could be so much nicer wearing glasses, I never before realized how nice a woman can look, when wearing glasses.
Then I remembered the doctor who examined my eyes, she looked very nice.
I can’t believe that now, I start to appreciate how nice women can look wearing glasses.


When my glasses were ready and I put them on, and I looked around, could not believe, how poor my vision must have been.
Everything I looked at, looked so sharp and well defined, I can’t believe it.
When, I looked at myself, saw a very handsome looking guy, I liked my new look.
I wore the glasses proudly, and when I came home, Ashley told me, she loved my new look, and that 
night, told me a few times how she liked my new glasses look.
I think I am going to like wearing glasses.


Now I look at every person wearing glasses, most of all the ladies, and it makes me feel good.
Sometimes I wonder what Ashley would look like wearing glasses, I am quite sure she would look fantastic, and then I think, of all the glasses wearing girls at school, that I refused to date.
I can’t believe it, I now like wearing glasses, and find looking at glasses wearing people, exciting.
Lately, Ashley has asked me a few times, what is so interesting when I spot a good looking female wearing glasses.


Ashley’s story.
-------------------


Lately, I have noticed my husband looking at every female who wears glasses, this all started, after he has started to wear glasses, why?
When I was having coffee, with my neighbor Kim, I casually mentioned that lately, ever since he started to wear glasses, Tom has been looking at every glasses wearing female.
Kim, who wears glasses, smiled, Ashley, some guys prefer the look of a glasses wearing girl, my husband does,
Perhaps he would like to see you wearing glasses.
I had never thought of that, I know he used to hate the looks of glasses, but since he started to wear glasses, he now likes glasses.
I am sure, I don’t need to wear glasses, and never gave glasses any thought.
Kim, what is it like to wear glasses?
Well most of all, you see properly, glasses are comfortable, you can look just as nice, or even nicer when wearing them, look at me when I take my glasses off.
I realized Kim sure looked a lot nicer wearing glasses.
She let me try her glasses, when I looked in a mirror sure noticed my different look, but I told her I could not see very well, wearing her glasses, they were a little to strong.
Kim said just a minute, and when she came back, put two pair of glasses in front of me, and told me to try them.
When I did and looked around was surprised how well I could see better when wearing the one pair.
Well Ashley, if you can see well wearing my glasses, you sure need an eye exam, the pair you like best, were my second pair.
Yes, I guess I do, I am surprised, but please do not tell Tom.
So I made an appointment for an eye exam, and Kim was right, I need to wear glasses.
I did not realize how hard it is to find a pair you like, but the help of the optician, sure helped, 
When my glasses were ready, and I put them on, was thrilled with my new look and my improved vision.
When I came home, and showed the glasses, to my neighbor Kim, she congratulated me on my new look.
I put my glasses in their case, and told her, that Tom’s birthday is in two days, and me wearing glasses is his birthday present.


To day is Tom’s birthday, and I told him, I am taking him out to his favorite restaurant.’
We sat down for dinner, when I asked Tom, to excuse me, and told him, that I almost forgot his birthday present.
When I came back wearing glasses, Tom was tongue tied, he did not know what to say.
After I told him, I would be wearing my glasses all the time, he thanked me.
We went home shortly after, and he would not let me take my glasses off, when we went to bed.
Now he finally knows, why so many good looking girls wear glasses.
