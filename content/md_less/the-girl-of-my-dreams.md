The girl of my dreams.

My second year of high school is almost finished, and I am looking forward to the summer break.
This year as usual, I am going to spend the summer again, at my uncle's farm, to help with the haying and the harvest.
I always enjoy being there with my cousin Jim, who is a year older, and the lucky guy, last year started to wear glasses, something I have always wanted.
Yes, I love the looks of glasses, and would love to wear glasses for myopia.


When I got off the bus at my uncle's farm, it was pouring rain and when arriving at the house, I was soaking wet.
My aunt greeted me, and told me to take my suitcase up to Jim's room, and get some dry clothes on, Jim now has a big bed and you boys will have to sleep together., I needed the other room to do my crafting.


When I entered the room Jim was there waiting, and greeted me like a long lost friend.
Jim you look fantastic wearing glasses, and after I had told him how good he looked wearing glasses, said, I wished it was me wearing glasses.
Logan, I have a surprise for you, I know you like glasses as much as I do, and if you still want to wear glasses for myopia, I have a pair for you,
You know that I want to wear glasses, where are they?
When I started to wear glasses last year, I was given the prescription, so I went on line, because I like to become a high myopic, and ordered 3 more identical pairs, all with a diopter increase, so I get used to wearing stronger glasses, and become more myopic
Here are the two pairs of glasses, that I am finished with, and you can have, my original pair, and the second pair, which is a diopter stronger.
I tried both pair of glasses, and decided, that I could see reasonably well, wearing his original glasses so I decided to wear them, until my vision was perfect, and then start wearing the next pair, I am so happy, I now have glasses for myopia to wear.


When we came downstairs to eat lunch, my aunt said, Logan, what a surprise, I did not know that you also are wearing glasses now, your mother never mentioned it to me. 
Yes I do, when I came in out of the rain, I had the glasses in my pocket. 
Well I am surprised, but you look very nice wearing glasses.
Great, now I can wear the glasses all the time., and everybody will think they are mine.


Wearing the glasses during the rest of the day, and after helping with the afternoon chores, my vision 
is almost perfect now, I sure like wearing glasses.
After the evening meal Jim and I went up to his room, where Jim showed me his computer, and favourite videos.
Most of them were about wearing glasses, and I enjoyed them.
We played some video games, until it was bed time.


It did not take me long to fall asleep and dreaming about my glasses, when something woke me,
being half asleep, it took me a minute, to realize, that Jim was playing with me, my member went hard,
and Jim kept on playing with me, I was awake enough to put my glasses on, and enjoy the feeling of the glasses on my face and Jim's hand on my joystick.
While Jim was playing with me, he put my hand on his member, and I returned the favour.


Next day my uncle gave us enough work to do, for the rest of the day, I like to be working in the fresh
air, and work up a good appetite, and be ready for the excellent meals my aunt puts on the table.
After working a few weeks on the farm, and my aunts good meals and pies, I started to grow some more, and put some more weight, and with doing a lot of heavy manual work, I can now, even show you some muscle.


I now have started to wear the next pair of glasses, and I am so happy, because I can see perfect now when wearing the glasses with the stronger prescription.
Jim and I spend a lot of time on the computer, and he ordered some more glasses, with higher prescriptions.
The glasses I wear at present have a prescription of -2.50, and I have perfect vision when wearing them, and I have noticed when I take my glasses off, everything in the distance looks a little blurry, great, I think I am really becoming myopic. 
When we are looking at he computer programs that we watch, I have noticed Jim, seems to like to prefer men's porn, I wonder if he is gay, I get the greatest kick out of watching lesbian sex, I like looking at the girls who wear glasses having fun.


Jim and I ordered some more glasses, and my next pair will be -3.50.
A couple of weeks later, when the glasses arrived, I started to wear the -3.50 glasses, and after wearing them for about a week., could see quite well, and I expected that in another week and my vision should be perfect.


I received a phone call from my mother, and she asked me, how come I was wearing glasses now., your aunt told me how handsome you look wearing glasses, where did you get the glasses?
Having to think of something in a hurry, I told her that that I had trouble trouble seeing objects that were far away on the farm, and when I mentioned it to Jim, he suggested that I most likely needed to wear glasses, so he let me try his old pair of glasses, and when I was wearing the glasses, could see perfectly, so I have been wearing the glasses ever since.
Well, I had not expected that, and I will make sure to arrange for an eye examination for you, before you go back to school, so you will have your own glasses.
After the phone call, I felt so much better, now my parents know I wear glasses., and won't be surprised when I come home wearing glasses.
What a pleasant surprise, I am so happy, now I can wear my glasses all the time, without a worry, that I will be seen wearing glasses.


Almost every night, Jim liked playing with my joystick, I enjoyed it and always returned the favour, but I would not do a 69, I did not care what he did with me, I always liked wearing my glasses and the nice feeling they gave me on my face, when wearing them.


My stay at the farm, will soon be finished, I will have a lot of good memories from this years stay.
Now I wear glasses for myopia, that I had always wanted, and had a good sexual education, and grew more into a man.


When I came home my mother could not believe how much I had changed in the past two months.
she liked my new glasses wearing look, and sure noticed how much I had grown, and she will get me some new clothes, before school starts.
My vision exam, is in a couple of days, what to expect?


I proudly wore my glasses going for my eye exam.
A whole new experience, this was the first time, I had an eye exam.
I had studied on V&S, about what to do when having an eye exam, and make sure that when 
I was asked which is better, to ask if I could move the lenses.
When the doctor, started to ask me which is better, I asked if I could do it,
the doctor let me, move the lenses, and when finished she told me I had a small increase in my prescription, and an adjustment for my astigmatism, and she wanted to see me again in a year.
She handed me my prescription, which read, OD -3.50, and OS -3.75.
I could not believe it, my own glasses with a nice prescription, I must have been a little myopic 
before I went to the farm, for my holidays, that I was not aware off, I am all excited, I am really 
myopic now. 
My mother who had come with me, to go shopping for new clothes, liked the new glasses frame 
we both selected, which she thinks, will make me make look studios and more like a man.
We bought some new clothes to wear to school, and on the way home, went to pick up my 
very own new glasses, I loved them.


When school started again, a lot of my class mates were surprised to see me wearing glasses, and a few
wanted to try them, and afterwards told me, that I must be blind.
What I liked best when some of the girls complimented me on my glasses, and how they liked my new look, now all I have to do, is find a nice, good looking myopic girl, who likes wearing glasses.
I did some dating, of course only, with glasses wearing myopic girls, and I am surprised how many there are, but I am more surprised, by the number of girls, that really don't like wearing glasses.


Finally, when I was in my last year of high school, did I find the girl of my dreams.
I was so lucky, that I met Shannon, a good looking girl, with a beautiful head of curly, dark blond hair, and who wears glasses for myopia.
Shannon had graduated a year before me and is about 6 months older then I am.
She works in the optical store, where I have my eye exam, and when I went in to have my annual eye exam, I met Shannon who is now working there, while she is studying part time to obtain, her optician license.
As soon as I saw her, I felt as if I got an electrical shock, it was love at first sight.
I noticed right away, that Shannon must have felt the same way.
After my eye exam, when Shannon looked at my new prescription, remarked that my prescription, was about a diopter lower than hers, and wondered if I tried to catch up to her.
I smiled, and mentioned to her that perhaps we should have a race, and see who has the highest prescription in a few years.
From then on we had a long pleasant conversation, and lots of fun, while she suggested the type of frame I should be wearing, to look fantastic in her opinion.


I could not wait, for my glasses to be ready, and my chance to see Shannon again.
When I had been notified that my glasses were ready, I sure did not waste any time. 
Shannon greeted me like a long lost friend, and I just loved it when she placed my glasses on my face.
Logan, you look good enough to kiss wearing those glasses.
Well I am looking forward to that, and before I left the store, we had made a date for a movie, on Saturday night.


I was really looking forward to my date, and she sure did not disappoint me, Shannon looked fantastic when I saw her, she was wearing glasses I had not seen on her before, she looked beautiful.
Her hair and her make up, were done so nice, she was a picture to look at.
When we were seated to watch the movie, we started to talk about glasses, and she told me she had started to wear glasses, in grade 2, she loved wearing glasses then, and she still does., and would not want to be without them.
So I told her my story, about inducing myopic, well I am glad you did, I love you glasses wearing look. Shannon let me try her glasses after the movie had started, and I noticed the difference, and I could see reasonable well wearing them.
Shannon told me that she likes her -5,00. prescription, but is not trying to get a stronger prescription, because she would like to have a large glasses wardrobe, she loves to be able to wear a different pair every day.
She likes the looks of -5.00 lenses as they show some nice rings and a bit of depth and would like to see my glasses, at about the same strengths, and will help me if I want to.
I found out she does likes that my new look is good enough to kiss, and we did plenty of it
How much luckier can a guy be, than to find a girl like Shannon, everything a guy can wish for. 
I better hang on to her!!!!
