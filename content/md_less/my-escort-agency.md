My name is Manwell 
I run an escort agency with a difference.
I started the agency about 20 years ago.
There are 20 girls that work for the agency.
Each girl has her own room and after the evening out they are free to do as they wish,each room is fitted with an alarm button.
About 2 years ago, things took a surprising turn.

Each month we hold a meeting to discuss how we look after the client's wishes and what changes we need to keep more regulars

During one of these meetings Amber asked for some advice 
“What do you think I should do boss”
“One  of my best clients has a fetish about girls that wear glasses, so when we go out I have a pair of glasses with Plano lens”
“Last week he asked me if I would have lasik surgery”

I was pusseled?

“If you have perfect vision why do you need l eye surgery”

“That's the problem last week he discovered my glasses were fake”
“He wants me to have laser surgery so I need real glasses”
“He is very rich and has a friend that would do it”

“What do you think boss”

I did not know what to say,but it was agreed that I would meet her client

2 weeks later it was all sorted a contract had been drawn up.
Amber would get a substantial payment plus a monthly payment over double her normal monthly earning,Incase her other clients left.
Of course I was substantially rewarded.
It was arranged that as soon as the money had arrived in the accounts that we had set up Amber  would have the operation and she would come back here to recover,before she meet her client again

When Amber arrived back from the private clinic by ambulance both eyes were heavily bandaged she was wheeled into her darkened room,
3 days later the nurse arrived to take off the bandages off and immediately  placed dark goggles on Amber you won't see anything thought the googles .your new glasses will arrive at the weekend.

3 days later 2 packets arrived I opened the first packet  it was marked distance the case did feel rather heavy.
Attached to it was a small card it read R -28 - 3.75 130  L - 32 -2.50 90
This meant nothing to me 

I went into Ambers Room and told her her glasses had arrived and the nurse had text to say it was ok to take the Google off.
Amber  screamed “what has he done to me I can't see anything I'm blind”
“Can I have the glasses he has sent me”

As I opened the case I could not believe what I saw,I had never seen glasses like it before the lens were over one inch thick.
As I placed them on Amber, her eyes looked the size of tiny peas and her face was shrunken in.

“Thank god I can see again but they are so heavy”
“Amber took them off  to took at them and gasped I can't see anything without them what do they look like”

I explained that there was a second packed marked reading glasses.

“Can I have them please”
As I opened the case a card fell out.
R-23  -3.75 130 prism out 8 
L-30.75 -2.50 90 prism out 8

“Do I have to change glasses each time I need to read my c p”
“I'm worried do you think he wanted me to look like this or the operation went wrong”,maybe he won't want me anymore”

It had been arranged that Amber would not meet her client for 2weeks so her eyes would have fully healed by then.

During the next 2 weeks Amber  stayed here and did it go out very much but was getting a Huge amount of complement from clients visiting the other girls.

The evening of her first meeting since the operation soon arrived
Amber need not have worried, as she came back home she was wearing a beautiful diamond engagement ring he loved her new look and found it exciting when she had to change glasses to read the menu.

That's how it all started 

Mary now wears plus 30.75 glasses
Her clients love her Hugh eyes.

Susan is now very short sighted and has a lazy right eye 
Even with 15 out prism you can only just see part of her pupil.in the corner of the glasses  

Lousie new glasses have a minus 15 lens left lens and plus 15 right lens and she has to put an eye patch on over her left lens to read 
 
Nicky had her right eye removed and her clients love it when she takes her prosthetic eye out and puts it in her pussy.

But we had to stop the operations as the surgeon retired.

This made the other girls very angry as the girls wearing glasses were earning much more

An emergency meeting was called.
It seems that many men have fantasies about girls with disabilities 
We made a list of the fantasy that the other girls thought would bring them that special  client.
After a lot of though 5 girls felt they wanted to stay as they were and hope they could get extra clients that left the other girls
The other girls made a list of the disabilities they thought would bring in more regular clients,
Then they drew lots as to who and the first choice 

I contacted the surgeon that had done the eye operations and he arranged for some of his colleagues to do the operations the girls needed.


6 months later we arranged a grand opening with a fashion show and clients could bid to be the first person to take the girls out for the weekend.

The show was opened by Amber wearing her new glasses with minus 42 Myodisc lens.
On the podium in front of her were her reading glasses which she had to put on the read the details of each girls disability 

First on stage was 21year old Barbra she had chosen to have her right leg amputated just below the right knee and was wearing a black peg leg.
She was joined by Meg who had her left leg removed high above the knee and wore a rather heavy looking  pink prosthetic 
Next to take the stage was Jill  in her wheelchair,she was wearing a low cut top and golden coloured shorts exposing  her 2 beautiful short stumps.
Pushing her wheelchair was Ann,as she stepped to the side you could see was wearing a full body and leg brace 

Amber bid us goodbye and was replaced at the podium by Margret.Her eyesight had also deteriorated  since the operation and her new glasses were plus 32 but  now she was unable to read with this prescription now and had separate reading glasses
,
Angel and Mary were next to come on the stage both looked very attractive,you could see the guests eyeing them in anticipation Angel stepped to the enge of  the stage and smiled at a gentleman before removing her dentures and sucking her thumb.
Mary joined her and turned to show us her large hearing aids.

The audience looked to the left entrance as Megan entered she had one bright red crutch as she got closer you could tell she had her right leg completely removed and just a small stump were her left arm had been.
Eyes turned to the other side of the stage as lorain walked in wearing her computer prosthetic left leg after having a hip disarticulation amputation

 
The stage was cleared and Louise came to the podium, she looked stunning in her new catseye glasses, the left lens was now minus 25 with 5.75 astigmatism and her right lens plus 20.
She was handed a card with the girls name on and the number of the person who was spending the weekend with her.

She hesitated for a moment  before putting a pink eye patch over her left eye
And picking up a magnifying glass and holding it close to her right eye before starting to call out the name of the girl and the number of the gentleman that was escorting her.
 
It was now my turn to thank everybody who had come tonight and inform them drinks and refreshment would me served in the adjoining rooms 

“But before you all go  I would like you to meet my new wife Nicky”
Everybody gasps with surprise 

You will remember Nicky had her right eye removed and wore a prosthetic eye,

She now wears a black eye patch instead and needs glasses with minus 35 Myodisc lens with a plus carrier and 22mil bowls  

As she started to talk her 1960 retro body hearing aids start to whistle 
I stepped closer to her and gently pushed the pink buttons further into her ears before putting my hand into her bra and adjusting  the volume on the control box that was hidden between her breast then straightening the connecting cords  

Nicky continued 

“I would like to thank you all and our girls for a wonderful evening.”
As many of you know I have been away for 2 months.
“Have a surprise for my husband he always calls me a pirate now I wear an eye patch instead of my prosthetic”
“So I decided to have my right legs amputated high above my knee”
She undid her long dress
To reveal a peg leg made of wood with beautiful carvings and beautifully polished..
It was held onto her stump with leather binding and cords 

“Next month I plan to have my left hand amputated and a hook screwed into the bone”
“Then my husband will have his real pirate”

I pulled her close to me and started to kiss her passionately as my tounge started to explore her mouth it felt different so smooth  I suddenly realised she was wearing full dentures my legs felt wet all  down my legs.
