What is wrong with me, I like to wear strong glasses.part 1


Kelley, is my name, yes, I am very proud, of my curly red hair., and my developing figure.
I have two, older brothers, they both wear glasses, just like my dad, who started to wear glasses,
when he was six years old.
They have told me, they all have myopia, and have trouble seeing, objects far a way.
My dad s eyes, look small, and his glasses show many, what looks like rings, I always loved the look of his lenses, my brothers lenses, are not as strong yet. 
Matthew, my oldest brother glasses, now show some rings, I think, all three look fantastic wearing glasses.
My mother also wears glasses, she is farsighted and needs the glasses for reading.
I have always wanted to wear glasses, but after every yearly, eye exam, I am told, I don t need glasses.


Since I was bored last night, I looked at different subjects, on my computer last night.
I don t remember, how I found Eye Scene, a site, discussing vision.
Induced myopia, caught my eye, and how, you can try, to become myopic.
Very, interesting, now all I needed to do, is to start wearing glasses, with lenses for myopia.
Looking through all my brothers dressers, was a waste of time, I could not find any old glasses that I could use.
Well, at least, I know now, how I might have a chance, to become myopic.


I am in my third year of high school, and my friend Carolyn, came to school today, wearing a new pair of glasses.
She looks fantastic, I am so jealous.
She told me, she had a change in her prescription, and her glasses are stronger now.
The next time I was at her place, I wanted to try her new glasses, to see what I look like wearing her new glasses.
I loved my look wearing her glasses, only trouble was, I could not see very well, when wearing them.
Carolyn, knowing I would like to wear glasses, suggested I try her old pair.
When wearing her old glasses, I was pleasantly surprised, my ability to see, was so much better.
After telling Carolyn, what I had found out about inducing myopia, she told me, I could borrow her old glasses, to find out, if I could become myopic, at least you will have glasses, to wear.
I put the glasses back on, and decided, I could see quite well wearing them, and I would give it a try, and wore the glasses, till I went home.


I started to wear the glasses, as often, as I could, and at school, during regular classes, but could not wear them any other time during school hours, so my brother would not see me wearing the glasses.
I could now see well, when wearing the glasses, but did not notice, any difference in my vision when not wearing the glasses.


I had my next eye exam, and I very slowly, and hesitatingly, read the wall chart, it did not help me, I was told the same as before, Kelley, your vision is fine, no glasses for you.
Well, I am a stubborn, red head, I am going to become myopic, before my eyes quit growing, when I am in my early twenties.


When I went back to my favorite website, reading about induced myopia, realized, I should be wearing the glasses, from the minute I woke up, till I went to bed at night, which I could not do.
Wearing contact lenses, it was suggested, was the only way, that might give me the result, I was looking for.
How was I going to find out, which lens to order, I know, you should be fitted, and find out, what my base curve, and diameter, is for the lens I need.
I have no other choice, I will have to go to a certified contact lens fitter. 


That night lying in my bed, instead of going to sleep, was thinking about glasses.
Then I thought of something.
Well I am going to have to talk, to Carolyn, to see if she will help me.


The next day, after school, when I went home with Carolyn, I told her, I needed her help, but it was 
a little complicated.
When we were in her bedroom, I asked her if she had the prescription, for her new glasses.
She went to her dresser, and after looking through her drawer, found it.
I read it, O D -1.75, O S -1.50, and I could not believe, what it said at the bottom, patients eyes, can be fitted, with contact lenses, that is what I needed.
Carolyn, asked me, what made you so happy?
Well Carolyn, here is my plan.
In The Mall, there is an optical store, where they fit you for contact lenses, by a certified contact lens fitter.
On the bottom, of your prescription, it reads, patients eyes can be fitted with contact lenses,
so they don t have to check the health of your eyes, they only have get, the base curve, and diameter.
Now, what I would like, is you go with me to the optical store, let me have your prescription,
and just before we enter the store, you let me wear, your present glasses, and you can wear your old ones.
After I have been fitted, and instructed, how to put the lenses in, and how to take them out, will be wearing contact lenses, and I will give you, your glasses, and prescription back.
Will you help me?
Sure, I will come with you, all you have to do, is buy me my lunch.
Great, I will make an appointment.


I sure was nervous, on Saturday, I am also excited about the possibly of getting, contact lenses.
Carolyn was ready, when I went to pick her up.
We boarded, the bus, to go to the mall, and as soon as we were seated, I put on my glasses, 
Just before, we went into the optical store, Carolyn, handed me her glasses, and I gave her back her old ones.
After I put the glasses on, was surprised, how much better I now could see now, when wearing the stronger glasses..
I had Carolyn s prescription, in my purse, and felt very confident, while walking into the store.
A very nice looking glasses wearing lady, asked for my name.
I told her I was Carolyn Ryder, and had an appointment for 9.30.
Yes, please follow me, miss Ryder, I am the optician, who will look after you, my name is Ann.
After I was seated, I handed Ann, the prescription.
Well, looking at you prescription tells me, we should have no problems.
After Ann, took some measurements, handed me a contact lens, and showed me how to insert it.
Then, she instructed me, how to remove the lens.
After, inserting, and removing , the lens a few times, I had no problem.
Ann, told me, you surprised me, did you ever wear contacts before?
No, this is the first time, 
Then she told me to follow all the instructions, for looking after contact lenses. 
Then Ann asked me to read the letters on the chart, wearing the lenses.
I was surprised, I had no problem.
Good, I think we have the right lens prescription, the price of the exam, includes a box of lenses, 
containers, for the lenses, and everything that you need.
If you have any problems, come and see us.
After I put Carolyn s, glasses and prescription, and other stuff, into my purse, I paid Ann, and went to see Carolyn.
With a sigh of relief, I left the optical store, mission accomplished
When Carolyn saw me, smiled, and said let s go to the food court. 
After we sat down, first thing, I did, was give Carolyn, back her glasses, and prescription. 
How, does it feel to wear contacts?
I am surprised, that they feel O K , and I can see, excellent, wearing them.
Then I showed, Carolyn, all the stuff, that is required, to wear contact lenses. 
l looked at the boxes with the lenses, and noticed the diopter was the same, as on Carolyn s prescription, the contact lenses, were stronger, than I had expected.
Carolyn, can you notice my contact lenses, are they visible?
Well, if you look very close, you can notice them.
Another problem, how can I get away, with wearing contacts, in front of my family?
That problem, got solved, when, we walked past, a notions store.
They sell, good looking glasses, with non prescription lenses.
We went into the store, and I tried a few pair, and Carolyn told me, that when, I wore the fake glasses, she could not see my contact lenses.
So I bought a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, that I really liked the look of, and started to wear them.
Now for the big test.


When, I came home, everybody, wanted to know about the glasses.
Wearing glasses, is now fashionable, and a fashion item, and a lot of kids at school wear them, it is the in thing, that is why I bought them.
They all complimented me on my new look, without noticing the contacts.


Surprisingly, I had no trouble wearing the contacts, and after a few weeks, noticed, that when I removed the contacts at night, I experienced blurry vision.
Because, I was almost out of lenses, I ordered contacts, 1 diopter stronger on line.
When Carolyn, received the package, brought them over to me, and I tried them right away.
Surprise, I could see reasonably well, wearing them, certainly good enough, to function.
After wearing the stronger prescription, I sure notice the difference, when I remove my contact lenses.
I think, I have done it, I will know for sure, in a couple of months, when I am due for an eye exam.


Carolyn, had another increase, in her prescription, and came over, to show me her new glasses.
Her new glasses prescription reads, O D. -2.25, O S -2.00, and some astigmatism.
I tried her new glasses, wow, they were strong, but I had forgotten, I was wearing my contacts.
After I removed my lenses, I tried the glasses, and my vision, was perfect, I looked at myself, in the mirror, and loved the looks of my eyes, behind the lenses.
I hated to give the glasses back to Carolyn, well, in a couple of months, after I have graduated from high school, and after I have my eye exam, I should be wearing, my own prescription glasses.




We received a letter in the mail to day, informing us, that our regular, optometrist, had retired.
The new optometrist, is Dr. Daley, and she is looking forward to serve us.
Well, something to look forward to, I never cared to much for the old doctor, and like the thought of the new one being a female.
I wonder how the exam, will go, and now looking forward to it.
At present, I am wearing, -2.25 contact lenses, and can see perfect, I wonder what my prescription will be.


I am all excited, when I walked into the vision clinic.
Ashley, the optician, greeted me, and asked me to go to the examination room, so I told her sorry, I first have to go to the bathroom.
When in the bathroom, I removed my contact lenses, washed my hands, and slowly walked into a fuzzy looking examination room.
After the pre exam, procedures were finished, I was asked to sit down.
Hello, Kelley, I am Dr, Kim Daley, I looked at your past examinations, I don t expect your vision, has changed to much.
I looked, at a younger than expected, pretty looking doctor, wearing strong myopic glasses.
She said I noticed, that Dr. Jones did not prescribe glasses for you.
After looking into my eyes, with the retinoscope, asked me if I had noticed any change in my vision.
Yes, all my family is myopic, and I now have trouble with my distant vision.
I, thought you might, there seems to be quite a change in your vision, since the last couple of examinations, you definitely are myopic now.
Next I had to read the Snellen chart., and did not do to well, so the doctor put the phoropter in front of my eyes,.
First with my right eye, I was asked to read the letters, and all I heard was a lot of clicks, the same with my left eye.
Then the doctor stopped changing the lenses, and asked me if I drove.
When I told her yes, she said, I cannot believe it, there is something funny here, with your vision, you could not drive safely, without vision correction.
At you last exam, Dr Jones, did not prescribe glasses for you, while you needed a -.0.50 correction.
To day, you need a -2.25, correction on both eyes, tell me how you managed, to become this myopic?
Have you tried to induce myopia? the increase in your prescription is not normal, you can tell me, nobody is going to know.
Yes, I induced myopia, I stared almost 2 years ago, just before my last exam, and that I had I removed my -2.25. contact lenses, and gave her my whole story.
Kelley, you did a very good job, and now you have your wish, wearing myopic glasses.
Ann, then told me, she had induced her myopia, and now she is wearing, her – 7.5 0, like she wanted.
She also asked me if I had tried, G O C , I told her I have read about it, and sure would like to try it.
After giving me, my prescription, told me, if I would like to try G O C , to come by her place, and she gave me her address and phone number.
I am going to visit her, I like that girl, and sure like tom try G O C


When, I came home, told my mother, about me having to wear glasses, she suggested, she come with me, to help select, a nice frame.
When the glasses were ready, my mother, right away how strong my prescription was.
Later at home I was asked, how come my first prescription was that strong, the I told them that the optometrist was surprised, that Dr Jones had not prescribed glasses for me, at my last exam.
The only comment I heard was that he had always prescribed, lower than needed.
They asked me, how I liked the new doctor, I think she is fantastic, and so pleasant.
Thank goodness, no more questions about my glasses.


I love wearing my new glasses, and now look forward to my next eye exam, and stronger lenses.


Because, I am still on the summer break, and I have not decided yet, what to do next, decided to give Kim, the optometrist a call.
When, I talked to Kim, she suggested, I come over Saturday afternoon, she would love to see me.
I bought, a bottle of wine, and some snacks, and went to see Kim.
