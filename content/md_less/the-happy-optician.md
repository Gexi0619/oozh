Kerry is a very happy optician , here is her story

Kerry was a good student, a pretty looking girl with a pleasant personality.
She had a brother Logan, who was a year older and in his last year at high school.
Kerry s closest friend was Megan, they had been friends for many years .
Megan was sometimes quite opinionated, like to day when she told Kerry she did not like Logan s latest girlfriend, she wears glasses that make her look awful, I thought he could do better than that.
Kerry said yes I have met her , she is very friendly and I think she is cute.
I like her and , I think her glasses look good on her , and what is wrong with having to wear glasses , my mother wears them and I think she looks nice.
Megan said  glasses spoil your looks , I don t like them.
Kerry was a little upset about Megan s attitude, personally she liked the looks of glasses on women as well as men , but preferred women.
A few days later Kerry s classmate Sandy came to school wearing glasses.
Kerry complimented Sandy  on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Sandy thanked Kerry and told her she was myopic, she had trouble seeing things clear , like the blackboard, and now wearing glasses could see perfect, she was very happy about that.
Kerry said I never realized glasses could help you that much.
Sandy said would you like to try my glasses, you might notice some difference.
Kerry said yes I would like to, and when she tried the glasses noticed everything looked sharper and more clear.
She gave Sandy her glasses back and said yes I noticed a difference , everything looked more clear, very interesting.
When she came home after school that day  had a talk with her mother, she wanted to know more about glasses.
She told her mother what Megan had said about Logan s girlfriend and also about Sandy getting glasses, and how nice she looked.
Her mother agreed with her that glasses could look very attractive, and are no problem to wear, and certainly help you see properly when your eyesight is not good.

Kerry s mother was due for an eye exam, so she suggested Kerry come with her and get her eyes checked, since her last check up was almost 4 years ago, and she suspected Kerry might have some change in her vision.
The following week Kerry and her mother went to the optical store to get their eyes examined.
Kerry was not sure what to expect, she had her eyes checked before but that was a long time ago.
She was sure her vision was perfect.
When the exam started she was very interested in the procedure and asked a lot of questions.
She was really surprised when she had trouble reading some of the letters, and when the optometrist started to ask her which is better, realized her vision was not perfect. Than she remembered when trying Sandy s glasses everything had looked sharper and had noticed a difference.
When the exam was finished , the optometrist told Kerry she was myopic and had some astigmatism and should wear glasses.
When Kerry saw her mother said , Mom I have to wear glasses.
her mother said that is all right, I kind of expected that, I have seen you squint quite a bit. 
I was your age when I started to wear glasses.
After trying many different frames they decided on a frame that they both liked and after taking the measurements were told to come back in about an hour and the glasses would be ready.
When the glasses were ready and Kerry tried them on was surprised about the improvement in her vision, and was happy she looked so good wearing glasses.
Her mother was very pleased with Kerry s new look and told her she looked beautiful.
That night at home both her dad  and brother told her how nice she looked wearing glasses.
When Megan saw her wearing glasses , did not say anything , and did not ask any questions.
back at school Sandy told Kerry she looked great and welcomed her to the glasses club.
Of course they had to try each others glasses and decided that the prescription was almost the same.
It did not take Kerry very long to get used to wearing glasses , and with her improved vision and the many compliments she had received about her glasses did not mind, and actually started to enjoy wearing glasses.
She had also become very glasses conscious, and started to notice everybody who wore glasses ,especially girls and loved the looks of glasses.
She started to notice that some lenses made the eyes look larger  and others showed some rings , it became a fetish.
The following year when she had her eyes examined  had a increase in her prescription and took advantage of the 2 for 1 deal.
She now loved wearing glasses and was very proud of them, what she liked best her new stronger lenses showed some rings, she loved that look.
After finishing high school, Kerry decided that ,since she liked glasses and the looks of glasses on people so much , to become an optician
She applied for college admission and was accepted. The 2 year course was challenging and she enjoyed it very much.
She had a great roommate , her name was Amy, they got along well. 
Both girls loved wearing their glasses , and trying each others , and feeling all sexy, they had a great time.

Graduation came and time to look for a job. It did not take her very long to get one    
When she started her new job the next week her new boss told her not to worry about him as he was gay.
 Kerry told him that was fine she liked girls.
The store was busy and Kerry had lots to do.
She always enjoyed adjusting and fitting frames , and helping people making good choices when selecting frames.
What she liked best was helping young women, putting their glasses on and feeling how they fitted behind their ears , her hands under their hair .
A few weeks later , a patient that came in for her regular eye exam, was a very pretty curly haired blonde, she wore glasses Kerry guessed her prescription was at least minus 6.
Hi, I am Judy , I have an appointment. Kerry said Hi and introduced herself  and got Amy ready for her exam.,she liked that girl.
When the exam was finished the optometrist gave  Kerry the file., and she looked at the new prescription.
Well Judy I see you have an increase in your prescription ,may I help you select a new frame.
Judy said yes please , you have such a large selection and I sure would appreciate your help , I don t see too well without my glasses.
So together they selected a smart looking frame that would look great with the stronger lenses.
Kerry than took the measurements and told Judy she would give her a call when the glasses were ready.
When Judy came in to get her glasses , and put them on, Kerry got all excited, Judy you look you look so beautiful wearing those new glasses, she felt like hugging her.
Judy was very pleased with her new glasses, and thanked Kerry  for her assistance.
A couple of days later Judy came back and asked Kerry to adjust her glasses they pinched a little behind the ears.
Kerry felt behind the ears to check for a good fit and made the adjustments, she loved this job.
Judy told Kerry the glasses felt very comfortable now and then asked her if she would like to have a drink with her after work.
Kerry told Judy she would love to , and they decided where and when to meet.
When Kerry arrived at the bar, Judy was all  ready there waiting in a booth.
Kerry came over , gave Judy a hug and sat down beside her, and they ordered their drinks.
Kerry looked at Judy and said I love the look of your new glasses with the stronger lenses, your eyes look so nice, and  with your nice curly hair  you look beautiful.
Judy told Kerry that everybody at work had commented on her new look, and she was very happy with her new glasses.
Judy told Kerry she had always loved wearing glasses. She got her first pair when she was 9 years old. 
She was very happy with her stronger prescription that she had always wanted, and liked the way her eyes looked behind the new lenses.
Kerry told Judy that she had always liked the looks of glasses on people, and when she got her own glasses. it did not take her long 
to love wearing glasses.
She loved it every time her prescription became stronger and liked it even better when her lenses showed rings.
They sure enjoyed each others company, they seemed to like the same things .
Judy asked Kerry if she had a boyfriend, so Kerry told her she was not very interested in men
Judy smiled , took Kerry s hand and squeezed it and said I was hoping you were my kind of girl, I feel that way to, and than gave Kerry a kiss and a hug.
Kerry smiled and said I love to be your friend, I think we have a lot in common .
So that is how their friendship started, Judy moved into Kerry s apartment and they loved each others company.
The next day at work Kerry realized she was a very lucky girl
She had a great new friend, who wore strong glasses, She enjoyed wearing her glasses. And she had a great job helping people selecting glasses and fitting them;
SHE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT GLASSES
SHE WAS A HAPPY OPTICIAN.
