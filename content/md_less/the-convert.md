The convert.




I hate the looks of people wearing glasses, my name is Kevin.
My mother wears glasses, with thick lenses, that makes her eyes look larger.
I am sure with those big eyes, she can look right through me, I hate that look, and there are three kids in my class, that wear glasses, with lenses just like that, I hate the looks of glasses.
Now, you know, why I don’t like the look of eye glasses.
I have had yearly eye exams, because my mother wants to make sure, I have no vision problem.
But thank goodness, no glasses for me.


I am growing up fast, have some good friends, and we play outside a lot.
We play baseball, football, and even some lacrosse, and loving it.
It won’t be long and I will be going to high school, and really looking forward to it, because I understand that they have more athletic programs.


Since starting high school, I am starting to look at girls more often, and there are some really good looking girls, with beautiful hair and pretty good figures.
I am not old enough yet, to drive, so I attend all the school dances, to dance with some nice looking girls.
It is surprising to me, that so many good looking girls are wearing glasses now, I don’t like that.


I am now a member of the track and field team, and at our last all high school meet, I came in third at the 100 meter, and first in the 500 meter run.
Now I will have to train hard for next years competition to do as good or better.
There are a few nice girls on our team.
Ashley, Megan and Kelley, are just a few of them, they are nice looking, and lots of fun.
I am looking forward to get my drivers license next year, so I can do some real dating, like to go and pick them up in a car, and do some necking on the way home.


Summer, is almost over, and time for another eye exam.
At the exam, I was told my eyes are healthy, and I don’t need to wear glasses, as I had expected.
School started, and I was soon back to my regular routine, of training after the last class in the afternoon.
We have started our driving course, and after, I had finished the course, was very proud when I got my license. 
My parents were very pleased, that I have my license now, and told me, that if I kept up my good marks at school, I can use my mother’s car for a date once a week.
I now can be more serious about a date, and I want a nice, pleasant girl to take out, 
My first date was a fiasco, when I found out, that Sandy a very pleasant, good looking girl, wore contact lenses.
I have to make sure I don’t make that mistake again.
The rest of the school year, I had regular dates, but so far, never really have a girl friend.


After working at part time jobs during the summer, I saved some money, and now have a bank account, and a credit card, and start to feel more grown up.


A new family moved in next door, my mother went over the next day, with a home made pie, to welcome them to the neighbourhood, 
When she came back, at supper told us that, the Wilson’s were a very pleasant family, and there were three girls, one about my age, and two younger ones.
She had noticed that both parents were wearing glasses. 
She asked me to take the girls out in her car to morrow, and show them around, so they get familiar with the area, I told her I would.


The next day, Emily, Jessica, and Olivia came over to our house.
I drove them around, to show the girls where the schools and play grounds are.
Emily, the eldest, is a very pleasant girl, and I will be in the same year at school, she asked me to show them the mall, they loved a chance to look around.
So to the mall we went, I settled in the food court, while the girls looked around.
When the girls came back, they were all excited, moving from a small town, they sure like the big city mall.
After they had some refreshments, we headed for home.
A couple of weeks later, when I met Emily, to walk to school, she was wearing glasses.
First thing she said, Kevin, how do you like my new glasses?
What else could I say, than that she looked very nice, wearing her new glasses.
I had a close look at her, and I must admit, she looked nicer wearing glasses, then she did before, when not wearing glasses, I could not believe I had noticed.
Emily, told me she was so happy, to have new glasses, because her old ones had broken, and now she can see properly again.


The years of high school went by fast, and I am now ready to go to college.
College life is fun, I met some nice girls, but almost all of them wear glasses.
I must admit some looked very nice wearing glasses, but I still don’t like the looks of glasses wearing girls.
During my last year, I met Ashley, a nice pleasant girl, and we seemed to connect right away.
Soon after, Ashley became the first real girl friend I ever had. 
Shortly after graduation we both managed to get good positions, and are ready to join the working world.
Both Ashley and I, like good movies, and we regularly go to see a new film.
We always used to like sitting way in the back of the theatre but lately, both of us prefer sitting closer to the front.
About a year later Ashley and I got married, and we bought a nice house.
We enjoy our married life, and love our new home.
Last night we went to see a movie, and on the way home Ashley mentioned, that it looks like all the 
lights now seemed to have halos around them, I told her, that I had noticed the same, and we are wondering why?


The next day, when Ashley was having lunch, with a girl she works with, she mentioned to her about seeing halos around lights, when driving at night.
Jo-Anne, told Ashley she had the same experience, before she started to wear glasses, 
It sounds to me you might have the same vision problem I have, and suggested perhaps, I should have an eye exam, you might need to wear glasses.
Are you sure? My vision is perfect, Jo-Anne smiled, we all think it is, until we find out it is not, I had an eye exam, that is when I found out, that mine was not, and I needed to wear glasses., 
I sounds to me, you have the same vision problem, that I experienced.
It might give you some idea to find out if there is an improvement in your vision, trying my glasses.
Would you like to try my glasses.
Yes, I would like to try them, I like to find out what I see when wearing glasses.
After I put the glasses on and looked around, could not believe, how the glasses improved my vision, 
Jo-Anne, I think you are right, what a difference in my vision when wearing your glasses, everything I look at looks so much brighter and so nice and clear.


What is it like to wear glasses? 
I now love wearing mine, my vision is perfect, and the glasses, are very comfortable to wear, and 
I really like my new look.
Well, I think, I have a real problem, my husband hates the looks of glasses.
Ashley, you look really good wearing my glasses, when he sees you, I don’t think he will object.
What shall I do?
Well, you should have your eyes examined, and if you have to wear glasses, wear them going home,
and I am quite sure your husband, when he sees you, will soon change his mind, about not liking the looks of glasses


Jo-Anne went with me, when I had my eye exam, during our lunch hour, and she sure was a big help, to find me a nice frame, I sure like the fame we found. 
After work, I was very nervous, when I went to get my new glasses.
How will I look wearing prescription glasses, will the glasses really improve my vision, and what will Kevin say when he sees me wearing glasses?
When the optician was finished adjusting my glasses, said I think, you will really like your new look.
I could not believe, how nice I looked wearing my new glasses, and what an improvement in my vision.
On the way home no halos around the lights, and everything I looked at, looked sharp and well defined.
I was so excited, about my new glasses, that I forgot all about wearing them, when I entered the house.
Ashley, is that you? 
What happened?
I walked up to Kevin, well my love, how do you like my new look?
Kevin looked mesmerized when he saw me.
Why don’t you sit down, while you look at me, and I tell you all about my new glasses and how I found out about my vision problem, and how happy I am, with the improvement in my vision, when wearing the glasses.
Kevin, I will tell you one thing, like it or not, I am going to wear my glasses.
Slowly, Kevin, looked at me again, and said, Ashley, what a shock I got, when you came in wearing glasses, I tell you I can’t believe, how nice you look wearing glasses,
I love your new glasses wearing look, don’t worry, I love you better than ever.
Perhaps ,you would like to go and see a movie to night, wearing your new glasses?
Yes Kevin let’s go.
I selected a seat near the rear of the theatre and was so happy, that I now could sit again where we
usually sat.
During the movie, Kevin asked me if he could try my glasses.
When he tried them, said , Ashley I can’t believe it, how the glasses make everything look so nice and clear.
Well, Kevin, it sounds to me, perhaps you to might need an eye exam, so you to can see everything nice and clear, like I do now.
Ashley, I think you may be right. I better have an eye exam, to find out.


The next Saturday morning Ashley and I went to the optical store in the mall, for my eye exam.
As expected, I was prescribed to wear glasses, and Ashley and I had a fun selecting a frame for me.
We were told, the glasses would be ready, in a couple of hours.
We went to the food court, to get some refreshments, while waiting for my new glasses.
I still can’t believe it, sitting here, now loving the glasses wearing look of my wife, and also looking forward to get my own new glasses, what has happened to me?


When Ashley and I went back to pick up my new glasses, I was like a kid getting a new toy.
I could not believe the difference the glasses made in my vision, when I looked around.
Looking at myself in the mirror, loved my new look.
Both Ashley, and I love our new look, we sure love to look at each other now, both of us wearing our glasses.
After Ashley, came home wearing glasses, it really converted me from a glasses hater, to a glasses lover,
I still can’t believe it, but it is true, I am converted, from hating the looks of glasses, to really appreciating the looks of glasses, and now loving the looks of glasses..
