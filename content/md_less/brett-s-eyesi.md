This is a true story to a point. As normal with my true stores names and minor details have been changed.. This happened in the very early 80's. There were 3 of us and sometimes 4 guys who hung out together. J. T. wore strong what I later figured out were plus glasses to this day as I'm still in contact with him. D. J. who still lives in town and I see from time to time did not wear glasses except possibly for reading although a couple of years ago I was showing him a video on my phone and he seemed to have no trouble seeing it unaided. Christian who was the youngest of the bunch wore what looked like strong minus glasses but only when he had too as he hated them. Christian and J. T. were still in school with Christian then J T. then D. J. and I was the oldest having turned 21 in 1980. One of the times Christian was hanging out with us I noticed he had brought his glasses which was unusual. I was told they had J. T. and D. J. had some Playboy magazines that they had to hide from their parents because they both had younger Sisters at home. I was told Christian brought his glasses to see the magazines clearly. Christian is the only one of the three that I don't see or talk to once in a while and he was a bit of a "wild child". One example is while we were all in my car Christian waved a 10 dollar bill at me and said if I would get him a 6 pack of beer I could keep the change. I refused as I don't do that kind of thing. I've often wondered if Christian who would probably be early to mid 50's now started wearing his glasses or changed his wild ways? I believe he was picked up one time whle still under age for public intoxication. Just a little story that I keep forgetting to ask D. J. who was his neighbor and knew him best.
