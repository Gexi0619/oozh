I don t want to be seen, wearing glasses! 


A story suggested by, Weirdeyes


I have a secret, I like the looks of eyeglasses, and as long as I can remember, wanted to wear glasses, but I never needed glasses
This fall, I am starting high school, and I don t know why, but my mother made an appointment
for an eye exam, for me, and my twin sister Sara.
Neither of us have vision problems, and nobody in our house wears glasses.
I asked Sara, have you talked to mom about the eye exam.
Yes, I did, she told me, that she visited our neighbor, Mrs James, the one, who wears glasses, and she told mom, that because, of all the electronic equipment, we are now using, most of us need to wear glasses.
All three of her children, are wearing glasses now.
Now, she is sure, that we, need to wear glasses.
I could not believe it, that when she told me, she likes the studious look, of young people wearing glasses.
I don t want to be seen wearing glasses, and I don t think you do.
You are right, I don t think, I want to wear glasses, and everybody looking at you, and saying, 
you are wearing glasses now, you must be blind, or, I see you are a 4 eyes now.
Well, we have no choice, mom told me, she is coming with us, to the optical store, for our appointment.


When we walked into the optical store, mother surprised us, when she told us, that she has her eye exam, and while we were waiting, should select a glasses frame, that we would like to wear.
While we were waiting for our exam, we both looked at some magazines, we had no desire to look for glasses.
When mother came out of the eye exam room, told me to go in for my exam, while Sara and I, look for a nice frame for me, because, I am going to wear glasses.


I found the eye exam interesting, because the doctor was very informative.
When the exam was finished, I was handed my prescription, right eye -0.75, left eye – I,00.
I was told, I would appreciate the improvement in my vision, when wearing the glasses.
Well, I got my wish, having to wear glasses, but I hate the thoughts of people looking at me, and saying, so you are wearing glasses now, or other comments.
Sara was mad, when she came out of the exam room.
He told me, I have to wear glasses, I don t want to be seen wearing glasses, I want contact lenses.
I was surprised,. when mother said, yes, you may have contact lenses.
After selecting frames, and Sara being fitted with contact lenses, we went for a bite to eat, while waiting for our glasses to be made.
Sara, wearing her contacts, told us, how surprised she was, that she could see so much better, but not to tell anyone, that she was wearing contacts. 
When we went back to get our glasses, my mother was delighted with her new look.
When I put my glasses on, and looked around, everything, I looked at in the distance, was so nice and clear, and well defined.
When I looked at myself, could not believe, how the glasses changed my appearance.
I decided right then, nobody, was going to see me wearing glasses.
When we came home, my mother wanted to know why, when I look so handsome wearing glasses, I did not wear my glasses.
The optometrist told me, I only need to wear my glasses, when looking at objects in the distance, like a movie, or in school, so that is, when, I will be wearing my glasses.


I soon realized, that, if I was not going to wear my glasses in public, I should not wear them at all.
So, I put the glasses out of sight, that way, I would not be tempted to wear them.
In class, I always sat in a seat, where I could see reasonably well, and before I knew it 
the school year was finished.


Mother insisted, that we have an eye exam, before going back to school.
I could not believe, when I was told, that I had an increase of a ½ diopter in each eye.
My sister surprised me, when she fell in love, with a new style frame, and told us, that now. she was going to wear glasses.
Glasses, are a big fashion item now, and lots of girls at school, who do not need prescription glasses, are wearing fake glasses, and I want to be seen, wear real glasses.
Mother, selected a frame for me, that she said, would make me look so attractive, that all the girls would like to date me.
When the glasses were ready, and I put them on, hated my new look, and I knew, that I was not going to wear them.


When I tried my new glasses, realized my vision was not very good, but, I was not going to wear the glasses, and put them, in the hiding place, with my first pair of glasses.
Mother asked me many times, why, I was not wearing my glasses, she just loves the way I look, when I wear my glasses.
I told her, I wear the glasses, only when I need them.


Driver education, was part of the next semester.
We were told to make sure, we have our beginners license, before we took the course.
I heard, that some of my class mates, were having trouble passing the vision test, and were told to come back, when they were wearing glasses.
When the students, who had failed their vision test, came to school wearing glasses, they sure received a lot of attention, comments and kidding. 
That, made me even more determent, that I would not be seen, wearing glasses. 
When I had to get my beginners license, realized, I could not see well enough, without glasses, to pass the test.
I went to my hiding place, and tried my first pair of glasses, I could see well enough wearing them, and put them in my pocket.
When I came to the license office, I was not wearing my glasses.
I had the vision test, and of course I failed, so I told the girl, I had forgotten to put my glasses on.
I had no trouble, passing the test, wearing my glasses, but now have a restriction on my license.
Now, my biggest worry was, that nobody would see me, wearing my glasses, when I had to drive the car with the instructor.
I was really lucky, the instructor did not seem to object, that when after leaving the school, I slowly put my glasses on, and took them off, just before we returned.
I received my drivers license, without anybody seeing me wearing glasses.
I managed to finish high school, by sitting in the front of the class, squinting, and borrowing notes.
Nobody, ever knew, I should have been wearing glasses.




I am enrolled in a business course, at our local college.
Before starting my course, we had our annual eye exam.
I could not believe it, when I read my new prescription, right eye -2.75, left eye -3.00, and some astigmatism.
When I tried my new glasses, realized, how poor my vision is, but I still did not intent to wear my glasses.
That sure changed, when I started my course, and realized, that now, I could not see well enough to take notes.
I had no choice, so at my next class, I hesitantly, put on my glasses.
Nobody seemed to notice, or say anything.
When the lecture was finished, I noticed, that almost everybody who wore glasses, kept wearing them.
Slowly, I started to get used to wearing my glasses, and sometimes, even forgot to take them off,
A few weeks later, when walking to the cafeteria, still wearing my glasses, a glasses wearing young lady, approached me.
Hi, I am Nicole, I like to buy you a coffee.
I had a good look at her, she had, beautiful wavy hair, a great figure, and wore a pair of very stylish glasses. 
My male parts, responded, she sure was a beautiful girl.
Of course, I accepted the invitation.
When we were seated, she told me, you are the handsomest, glasses wearing male, on this campus, I had to meet you.
Well, I am glad to meet you, I think you are beautiful. 
Your choice of eyeglasses, could not be better, the color of the frames, blend so nice, with your skin tone and hair.
We had a lot to talk about, and one thing she asked me, why I did not wear my glasses all the time, you look so much better, when you are wearing glasses.
That was when I decided, I was going to wear my glasses all the time.
A beautiful girls comment, made me realize, how stubborn and stupid I had been, not wearing my glasses, when I really, had always wanted to wear them, and needed to wear them to see properly.


When I came home that night, everybody wanted to know, what had happened to me, I was wearing my glasses. 
I did not want to tell them about Nicole, so I told them, I had forgotten to take them off after classes.


I had a date with Nicole, and we went out for dinner.
What a pleasure, to sit, and look at Nicole s blue eyes, behind her myopic lenses. 
We had a lot to talk about, and I told her, about my reluctance, to be seen in public wearing glasses, when I always had wanted to wear glasses.
She said, you sure were a silly boy, you had a glasses fetish, and did not do anything about, you don t realize, how much enjoyment you missed.
Nicole then told me, she loves wearing glasses, and that she also has a glasses fetish, and how when she was young, always wanted to wear glasses.
I had a girlfriend, Amy, she started to wear glasses for myopia, when she was 4 years old. 
We became friends in grade one, she was a very sweet girl, and I liked her, she looked so nice wearing wearing glasses 
Amy knew, I wanted to wear glasses, and she gave me her old glasses, when she got new glasses.
I loved wearing them, and wore her -2.50 glasses so much, that I soon became myopic. 
I started to wear prescription glasses, in grade 3., and I always enjoyed my eye exams, and being prescribed stronger lenses, and I expect, that my prescription will increase some more, at my next exam. 
My present glasses, are -6.50 for the right eye, and -6.75 for the left eye, I love the look of my lenses, that show some rings, and show some depth.
We sure are quite a pair, and I will try very hard, to stay friends with her, she is beautiful, and smart.
Thanks to her, I learned to enjoy, and be proud of wearing glasses.
I have to agree with her, I missed a lot of enjoyment, because, I did not want to be seen, wearing glasses.
