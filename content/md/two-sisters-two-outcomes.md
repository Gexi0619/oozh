Two sisters two outcomes.
About five years ago I was in my local Specsavers sitting in that area where they fit your glasses. Opposite me were two rather attractive blue eyed blonde girls about 16 to 18, sisters with their mum clearly. The mum wore plus glasses with a prescription of about +6 the older of the girls was wearing plus glasses of about a +12 prescription. Strangely I  thought the younger sister was not wearing glasses at all.
So at this point I am making the assumption that the older of the two had inherited their mum's eyesight and then some and her younger sibling as a result maybe had escaped having poor eyesight altogether. I began to think how that might have made the girls feel about this? Maybe the older girl felt cheated at having really poor eyesight so that some how that had spared her younger sister. The younger sister also being the somewhat more attractive of the two thinking thank fully she'd escaped the curse of wear very thick glasses.
The mum and older sister got up and moved into the sales area and started to browse the frames and I thought it odd the younger girl had stayed in her seat. Then the optician came in with a pair of glasses and said he'd adjusted them and asked the girl to try them on. Well wow you could have knocked me over with a feather she was wearing a pair of glasses with a hefty minus prescription in the mid-teens I'd guessed. I remember the light flashing of the flat fronts of the lenses and how her eyes look so small disappearing in all those power rings. it was not often I came across someone as short sighted as I am and so attractive too.
At this point I remember thinking that at some point she must have  thought she'd gotten away with having poor eyesight because she wasn't very long sighted like her sister. What a shock it must have been when she realized she was getting short sighted then had to start wearing glasses too and then she got thicker and thicker lenses over time.
I have only experienced something similar once since. I came across two southeast Asian girls with their mother. The mother was not wearing any glasses but the two girls were. The older girl I knew already from work and she was short sighted about -10. This was the first time I'd seen her sister and I was very surprised that she was wearing very strong plus glasses indeed. I wondered if a similar experienced had played out between theses sisters too? One thing I did observe from these encounters was that the girls wearing plus glasses seemed to me to more shy and possibly less self confident?
