My glasses collection


Hi, my name is Sadie, I will tell you my secret, I love eyeglasses.
My new teacher, wears glasses, 
I love the looks of her frame, but what I like best, are the lenses in her glasses, they make her eyes look smaller, and more defined, 
It looks, to me, as if she looks through a little bowl, with rings, around the bowl, I really like that look.
At present I don’t wear glasses, but I will, 
I want to wear glasses, and I think, I have an idea of how, I may be able to get myself, a pair of glasses to wear.


My best friend Sandy, wears glasses, her two sisters, and their parents wear glasses., the whole family is myopic.
Perhaps, I can get a pair of Sandy’s old glasses.
Sandy knows, I love the look of glasses, but she never talks about her glasses.



After their yearly eye exam, before going back to school, Sandy’s whole family, are now wearing new glasses.
I hope, that now I have my chance, to get myself a pair of glasses to wear, there must be some of the old glasses somewhere, that they don’t need, so I can get a hold of some glasses, then I will have a nice pair of glasses to wear.
I heard Sandy’s mother mention, about giving all the old glasses to charity, I sure would like to get a hold of one pair of the glasses, before they are all gone.
I was lucky, when after visiting with Sandy, her mother asked me, if I woulds be so kind, to take the bag of glasses to the optical store, and drop them in the glasses for charity box, on my way home.
I told Sandy’s mother, I would be glad to. do that. 
But I am taking the glasses, home first, so I can sort through the glasses, to see which ones I would like to have.


I went to my bedroom, and closed the door.
I was all excited, and when I opened the bag, and there were ten pair of glasses, I tried them all, to find out, how well I could see, so I put each of the glasses on, and tried them.
Then I looked in the mirror, to see how I looked wearing the glasses, and now have selected, three pair, that I like the looks of, and that I think, can wear
I am sure ,the prescriptions in the glasses, are all a little stronger, so I can slowly get used to. wearing one pair of glasses, and than try the next higher prescription glasses, trying to make my vision myopic.
I put all the other glasses, that I did not want, into the bag, to take to the optical store.
First, I put the weakest prescription glasses, that I am going to wear, in my pocket
As soon, as I was around the corner, on my way to the optical store, I put the glasses on.
I loved the feeling of the glasses on my face, and was surprised, how well I could see, wearing the glasses, I am so happy now, at last, I am wearing glasses.


When I entered the optical store, I handed the bag to the optician, who thanked me.
She complimented me, how nice I looked wearing glasses, and how nice the frame blended, with my hair colour.
That compliment, sure made me feel good.!


I love wearing the glasses, every chance I get, but, when I wear the glasses, I have to be careful, that my parents, don’t see me wearing glasses. 
It is difficult, not to forget sometimes, that I am wearing glasses, and to take them off in time, before I get home


I wanted to start wearing the glasses, going to school, but I will have to talk to Sandy first, to tell her what I have done.
When I told Sandy, what I had done, she laughed, why did you not ask me? I would have given you a pair of glasses
Well, I really did not want to tell you, that I wanted to wear gasses.
I will keep your secret, wear the glasses all you want, I won’t tell.
That was the day, I started to wear the glasses, going to school.
After the usual comments, and a few of the girls trying the glasses, I now, am a regular glasses wearing girl, as I have wanted to be for a long time.


Not long after, I started to wear a similar looking pair of glasses with a stronger prescription, the prescription that was still in the glasses case, read, -2.50, and -2.25, and it sure did not take me very long to see perfectly, wearing the stronger glasses.
I sure like my looks, much better now, when I wear my glasses, I love the look of the stronger lenses,
So far, my parents do not know, I wear glasses..


We had the Christmas break, and because I could not wear my glasses as often,, I now realize, I have to wear prescription glasses, to see properly.
Whenever, I had a chance, I started to wear the next stronger prescription pair of glasses, which were -3.25, and -3.00 and wearing the stronger prescription glasses, give me almost perfect vision.


Everything changed, when my mother’s sister and her family came to visit.
My niece Vicky, now wears glasses, and every body had to tell her how pretty, and nice she looked wearing glasses.
Then my mother asked Vicky, to let me try her glasses, she wanted to see, what I would look like wearing glasses.
When I tried them, realized the prescription was not more then -1.50.
My mother thought I looked very nice wearing glasses, and she asked me, if I could see properly wearing the glasses?
I told her I did not think, the prescription was strong enough for me,
What do you mean?
I should not have said that.
Well, I don’t see any difference, wearing the glasses.
Then my aunt mentioned, that a lot of young people do not realize that they have a vision problem, until they have an eye exam..
I guess Sadie, should have an eye exam, so we know for sure, if she needs to wear glasses, it has been a while since she had an eye exam, I will make sure, that she has an eye exam before she goes back to school.


I am going to be able to wear my glasses full time at last, I cannot not be soon enough, because now, I cannot see very well, when I don’t wear my glasses.


Sitting in the big chair, in the eye examination room, I looked around, now I remember some of the procedures..
The doctor, a beautiful glasses wearing lady, asked me some questions.
I loved looking at her glasses, the lenses made her nice blue eyes look smaller, and showed some beautiful rings, just the way I like it.
When, the doctor, was adjusting the lenses, to find the right ones, she asked me, have you worn glasses before?
Now, what to say?
Why did you ask, if I had worn glasses before? 
Looking at your present prescription, it is hard to believe you managed to see properly, not wearing glasses.
So I told her my story, of wanting to wear glasses, and have been wearing glasses most of the time, for the past five months
Now, I can understand why your prescription is so high for a first time having to wear glasses.
Because you are growing, and going through puberty, you are now a real myopic, with a prescription, of -2.75 and -2.50 and you can expect increases, until your mid twenties. 
I know, another person who became myopic, like you did.


My mother was very surprised, I was prescribed to wear glasses.
I wonder ,if she will notice the lenses, when I wear my new glasses.


Selecting a new frame, did not take me very long, a frame, that I really like and looks good on me. 
My new glasses, will be ready to morrow afternoon, so another 24 hours, before I can see properly.


The next day, when the optician, handed me my glasses, and after I put them on, I looked around, and everything I looked at, sure looked clear and sharp, I loved it.
Looking in the mirror, I loved my new look, the frame looked fantastic, but what I liked best was the look of the lenses, just the way I like them.


When, my mother looked at me, she was sure they made a mistake, the lenses, looked so strong.
Mother the glasses are the right ones, my vision, is perfect.


When Sandy, saw me, she loved my new look, and after trying my glasses, told me they were stronger then her glasses.


I would like a stronger prescription, when I go back in six months for a check up.
I still have the pair of glasses with the stronger prescription, and I will start wearing them when I go to school.


I have grown fast lately, and when I went back, for my six month check up, my prescription had increased a half diopter for both eyes.
Another pair of new glasses, and another pair of glasses, for my collection


All through high school, my glasses prescription went up every time I had my yearly eye exam.
I am so proud of my glasses, and love the looks of my new glasses, which are over -5.00 now


I love wearing glasses and I love optical stores.
During my third year in high school. I started to work part time at the optical store, greeting customers, and assisting them, selecting frames, when they were prescribed to wear glasses.
I am going to work in the optical field, I am going to be an optician.


To day, while working at the optical store, there was a beautiful velvet lined box, that can hold 24 pair of glasses, and I had the box given to me
My collection of glasses, is now in the box, and there are fourteen pair of glasses, that I have worn since I started wearing my glasses..
I love looking at them, and think back, to the day, that I wore the first pair.


Time goes fast, I am now a registered optician, and contact lens fitter, and now work at busy, optical store. where I get a new pair, prescription glasses every six months.
To day, one of our customers, was a very handsome young man. 
He was very upset, when after his eye exam, the optometrist, had told him, he should be wearing glasses full time.
I looked at his face, and knew, what frame would look best on him.
When I showed him the frames, and he tried them on, and looked at himself, and he was surprised, he could look that handsome, wearing glasses.
I sure liked that guy, he was pleasant, and would look fantastic wearing glasses,
Spending some extra time with him, and giving him a lot of nice comments, made him feel better, having to wear glasses.
After taking the necessary measurements, and explaining to him what I did, he wanted to know, when his glasses would be ready.
Before I could answer, the optician, told me to take my break.
When I told him, that the lab. was getting the lenses ready, and to come back in about an hour, and his glasses would be ready.
Then he asked me, since you have your break, may I buy you a coffee?
That would be nice, I am on my supper break now, and have some time.


Well you know that my name is Logan. well Sadie, what about some supper?
I would like that.
So we had some nice Italian food, and we sure had a lot to talk about, and before we knew it, my break was finished, and I had to return to the store.


Logan\s glasses were ready, and I fitted the glasses for him.
He likes his new glasses wearing look, and thanked me for my 
good service, and asked me for a date, which I accepted.


Logan is now a part of my life, and we are going to be married, next weekend, and live in a new house. 
Before the wedding Logan had another eye exam, and new glasses, now I can add Logan’s glasses to my collection, and start filling up another nice velvet lined box.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Ten years later


Logan and I now have an adorable family.
Three girls, 9 year old Debra, 7year old Stacey, and 5 year old Sandy.
Both Debra, and Stacey are now wearing glasses, they both are myopic.
I think, the way Sandy is holding her book, when she is reading, will be wearing glasses., pretty soon.
Now I have to get another big box, so I have a place, for all the glasses, that will be coming in the future, 
Looking at all the glasses, I have in my collection, all dated, some with pictures, is like a history book, 
I love my glasses collection.
