This story is about an attractive blond girl with whom we worked together some times. Just imagine a pretty blond girl who has myopia and slight exotropia in both eyes looking close which is becoming significant when she is looking far. For me, it makes her even more attractive. Unfortunately, she is only wearing contacts so I have never seen her in glasses.
I realized immediately that her eyes are a bit turning out even when she is not focusing far. During the other times, I also realized that she is struggling with her vision quite often. The first sign were that we needed to go close to be able to read some placards on the wall. I first thought that the reason of her squinting is that she needs glasses but later, she told me that she got glasses when she was about 7-8 years old. I also saw some pictures about her on Facebook where she was squinting to see and her eyes turned out significantly.
Later, she told me that she is not watching her TV in the living room because she cannot see it. She also told me that she went to the eye doctor because of that but her vision became even worse with the stronger prescription. 
I had 2 more times when I saw her struggling. Once, a photo was taken about some of us in a photo box, we needed to focus maximum 1 meter far. However, her eyes turned out significantly and she had some visible squinting showing that she couldn't see well. During the other time, we were at the bus station and I told her that this bus will be ours with the given commercial on the side but she couldn't see the commercial even with hard squinting. 
Unfortunately, I don't know her prescription but she probably has significant amount of minus diopters.
