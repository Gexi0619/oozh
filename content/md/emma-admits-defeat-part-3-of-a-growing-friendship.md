Below is Part 3 of 3...continued from the A Growing Friendship thread (Some adult content). Enjoy!

That Friday, with just a week left before Emma would return for her last semester in college, she woke up and once again headed downstairs to make breakfast. Her mom was in the kitchen, her dad already had left for work.
“Hey Emma, I hope you’re free this morning at 11.”
“Why’s that mom? I should be. Do you want to go out shopping?”
“So to speak. I made an eye doctor appointment for you.”
“What? Why did you do that mom? I told you on New Years that I see fine and that the light in the restaurant was just poor. I mean, I even tried on Becky’s glasses the other night when we were out and they just made things worse.”
“I understand your points Emma, and I’m sure you can see far away just fine. However, the other morning when you said the newspaper was smudged from the rain, I picked it up later in the day and the print looked fine to me. I didn’t see any smudged print.”
Somewhat flustered Emma replied, “well maybe you found a section that wasn’t wet. Mom, it’s fine. I really don’t need to go.”
“Emma, it’s no big deal. If you don’t need them then you’ll know for sure. We can go shopping like you suggested too, after the appointment!”
An hour or so later Emma was in the eye doctor’s waiting room with her mom. She picked up a magazine and figured, “I’ll show them. I may like Jen in glasses but that doesn’t mean I want some myself.”
She cracked open People and began reading. See, not a problem, she thought. I can see the text just fine. After 30 minutes, Emma was still waiting and her she decided to stop reading. Her eyes seemed tired.
Finally, Emma’s name was called and the 22 year old, athletic, curvy brunette walked into the exam room. After boilerplate introductory questions, Dr. Grady, a nice looking 45 year old father of four, walked in to greet Emma.
“So, what brings you in today Emma? Are you in school?”
“I am. I will be returning in a week for my last semester actually! My mom made this appointment for me today because she thought I might need glasses but I have tried on some of my friend’s glasses and sit in the back of the class and never have any issues.”
“Well, it seems like you see distances very well. Let’s take a look at your eyes and we’ll see if you need glasses or not. Have you had any headaches? Times where you can’t see anything close up?”
“Well, not really. I mean, sometimes I am tired after I read and the other night at dinner the menu was hard to read but the lighting was poor and I was able to read it fine after I adjusted the position of the menu.”
“Well that’s good to know, let’s take a look” said Dr. Grady.
A similar process to Jen’s exam ensued. The big E was placed on the wall and Emma said “E” as the doctor tested her right eye. The lines got smaller and smaller and eventually Emma said “L E F O D P C T.”
“Very nicely done, Emma. Let’s look at the left eye.”
The same process was undertaken and Emma managed to get the 20/20 line correct.
“Alright Emma. You are correct, you have great distance vision. I am going to put some drops in your eyes so we can look inside of them to check their health and check your near vision.” The drops were put in and Emma went to sit in the waiting room while they started to work. She explained to her mom that she could see far away very well.
Twenty minutes later, the doctor called Emma back into the exam room. On her way in, she looked at her watch and couldn’t make out the time! “Dr. Grady, I can’t read my watch!” “Don’t worry Emma, that is a normal occurrence with these drops. That doesn’t mean you need glasses. We have to take a closer look.
Once again, the phoropter was swung in front of Emma’s eyes and Dr. Grady put the 20/20 line on the chart and asked Emma to look at it with her right eye. Emma was somewhat surprised to find it was blurry and said she couldn’t read it. Wow, she thought, the doctor must have thought I had really good vision and made the text really small.
Dr. Grady jumped to the 20/40 line which Emma said she could read. A few lenses were flipped and Dr. Grady went back to the 20/20 line and Emma said it was clear. At this point Emma was quite confused. Why is he flipping lenses in my face when I could see just fine earlier? The same process occurred with the left eye.
“Now Emma, here is a card I want you to read. Look at the bottom, smallest line. Can you read it?”
Emma thought he had to be joking. The whole card was a blur as she looked at it with her naked, dilated eyes.
“Let’s take a look through the phoropter,” Dr. Grady said and swung it back in front of her face, “now what can you read?”
Emma was able to read the middle line. After some more flicks of lenses, Emma said she could read the bottom line.
“It’s good your mom brought you in today Emma. You would really benefit from some glasses.”
“Why is that doctor? I told you I can see just fine.”
After explaining to Emma latent hyperopia, Dr. Grady said goodbye to Emma. Leaving the exam room, Emma was trying to process what Dr. Grady had said. Wear them all the time. Vision likely to get worse. This is only a starting point for the prescription. Distance vision will be somewhat blurry and then improve.
Her mom helped her pick out some frames and Emma went home. For the next week while she waited for her glasses to be ready, Emma still wondered why she needed specs. Her mom had offered Emma her old reading glasses but Emma had refused.
The day before she left for the last semester of college, Emma went to collect her glasses. As the optician took them out of the case, Emma thought that those couldn’t possibly be hers. They looked too strong.
“Now, these are a bit strong for a first pair,” the optician said, “try them on to see how you like them.”
Emma took the glasses and put them on and immediately the whole desk, her hands, the opticians face, became very big but extremely clear. Emma looked into the distance and found a washed out blur. How am I supposed to deal with this, she wondered.
As she left the office with her glasses on her face, she looked down at her prescription (OD + 3.25 +0.25 x 75; OS +2.75 +1.00 x 90) and thought of how it would compare to Jen’s.
Back at school, Emma found Jen in their first class of the semester together. Emma saw Jen in the back of the room and quickly sat down next to her. Jen turned to Emma and was shocked to see her friend in glasses.
“Oh my god Emma! Are those your glasses? I thought you had perfect vision.”
“Well, I guess not Jen and we are twins now! Apparently I was straining my eyes for a long time to see and these help ease the strain.” In fact, they had helped. In just the two days since Emma had picked up the glasses, she noticed her eyes felt fresh and she could see close up with ease. Distance was becoming clearer as well. Now, she noticed that Jen was as beautiful as ever.
Sitting next to Emma during that first class, Jen couldn’t control herself and immediately rushed back to her apartment after class to pleasure herself.
Later that evening, the two friends were studying in the library. In low light, Jen took her glasses off to clean them. When she looked up, she caught Emma starting at her. Their eyes locked. Jen slipped her glasses back on and they left the library together.
