It all started, when my favorite toy, Teddy Bear lost one of his nice blue eyes.
I had always loved to look at those nice blue eyes.
My mother realizing how unhappy I was,  took me to a craft store to find an eye to replace the lost one.
The lady in the store brought out a box full of eyes.
Brown, blue, big eyes, small eyes, I had never seen so many eyes.
I had a hard time deciding if I wanted blue or brown eyes.
A pair of blue eyes is what I finally decided on.
When we came home my mother fixed my Teddy bear up with the new eyes.
That was the day I started to look at eyes, they are so beautiful.
My mother wears glasses, and now I notice how nice her blue eyes look behind the lenses of her glasses


To day is my birthday, I am now 6 tears old .
My aunt came.
Carolyn, I found you a special gift, I heard from your mother all about Teddy bear losing an eye.
I opened the parcel, it was a book, great I love reading.
The tittle of the book was, the bear who needs to wear glasses .
I looked through the book and there were 4 pair of special eyeglasses to go over the pictures of the bears, so you could see how they would look wearing the glasses.
I was really surprised how the looks of the eyes changed when the glasses were in place.

When we were having dinner, I told the family, that I now know, that eyes look more attractive when  a person wears glasses, just look at mom.
I tried to see what I looked like with the bears book glasses, I liked my look, but the bear glasses  are to small for me, I like to get bigger glasses.
My dad laughed, and asked me if I thought everybody should wear glasses?
Yes, I think so, their eyes will then look more beautiful.
Dad said well I have an eye appointment to morrow and most likely have to wear glasses, will that make you happy?
Yes, I like that, your eyes will look so much nicer.
My older brother told me he does not want to wear glasses, he likes the looks of his eyes the way they are.


A few days later my dad asked me if I would like to go with him, to pick up his new glasses
I was all excited when we walked into the optical store, I could not believe how many pairs of glasses there were on display.
I walked over to the kids section, and looked at all those nice glasses.
My dad told me to wait, your mother made an eye appointment for you, she wants to make sure your vision is fine, first we have to get your eyes examined.
While my dad had his glasses fitted, I had an eye exam.
I told the doctor that I love the looks of eyes, more so when the person wears glasses
The doctor asked me if I could read, and do I know all the letters of the alphabet.
Off course I do, I read books all the time. 
So the doctor put a great big pair of oversize glasses in front of me, and asked me to read some letters on the first line, and then the second line.
When she asked me to read the letters more then half way down, I had some trouble reading them.
I heard some clicks and the letters were easy to read, just like magic.
When the doctor was finished, she told me I am a little nearsighted, and wanted to talk to my dad.

The optometrist told my dad that I am slightly myopic, -0.50 on the right eye, and – 0.75 on the left eye. should she prescribe glasses now or wait till my next appointment, in about 6 months.
Carolyn is myopic like her mother.
Well, she might as well have them now, she likes the looks of eyes behind lenses.
Carolyn, what kind of glasses would you like to wear?
Dad helped me select a nice frame, I am so happy, I am going to wear glasses, and my eyes are going to look so much nicer now.

When my glasses were ready and I put them on, first thing I did was look at myself in a mirror.
My eyes looked so nice, I loved my framed look.
When I looked around noticed that everything I looked at was so much nicer and very clear. 

My mother was very surprised that I needed to wear glasses this young, she expects my prescription most likely end up higher than hers when I get older.
I am very proud of my glasses and wore them to school the next day.
I answered a lot of questions, and I am sure a few of the girls were jealous.


I have yearly eye exams, and now I am going into grade 4..
At my last exam was told that my prescription is now – 3,00 
I love the looks of my eyes behind the new lenses.
All my old glasses are in my bedroom dresser drawer, I treasure them. 

This year at school, we are studying the planets,
I am very interested, and at night, go and look at the stars, and the moon, so interesting.
At the library, I picked up some books, and now while laying in bed, I am reading about Mars and the Martians.

I am hearing a very strange sound, I run outside and notice what looks like a large disc slowly coming down in the park across from our house.
I feel very warm, and notice the snow on the ground is melting.
Now, I realize the large disc is a space ship, just like the pictures in the book, I nave been reading.
The space ship is slowly coming down, and I notice four legs are unfolding to support the space ship on the ground,
A large door opens and I see a stairway coming down.
Not long after I notice some people, no, they do not look like people, coming down the stairs.
They seem to have legs and arms, but so different then we have.
I walk toward them, to have a good look.
They are not very tall, thin, and have legs, and arms but different than my arms and legs.
Their heads are a kind of egg shaped, and notice their green eyes are bigger than mine,  they are beautiful.
There are four of them, and they slowly walk toward me.
I could not move, I loved the looks of their eyes, they were mesmerizing.
When they reached me. they surprised me when they spoke to me in a language that I could understand.
We are Martians, and live on the planet Mars, we like to be friends and are interested in some earthly developments, that we don t have.
Looking at me, they wanted to know all about my glasses, when I explained to them, the glasses made me see things far away nice and clear.
Of course they wanted to try my glasses.
When all four had tried them, and gave me my glasses back, they told me that they noticed a difference.
They told me they want to get some glasses.
I told them to wait, ran to the house and went to my bedroom and picked up all my old glasses.
Soon 3 of the martians were wearing my glasses, they looked around and all told me they could see so much better now.
I loved the looks of their big eyes behind the lenses.
They all thanked me, and wearing my glasses went back to their spaceship, and up the ladder.
Before I knew it the spaceship took off, and disappeared with the martians wearing all my old glasses.
Well, I really did not need them anymore, I am glad they like to wear them.
I went back to bed, hoping to dream about all those beautiful eyes.

The next morning, when I went to my dresser, all my old glasses were gone.
I smiled, my glasses had gone to Mars and made 4 martians happy.

A few days later, after school, my brother said Carolyn, here are your old glasses back.
Mother told me I could take them to school, to use for props in a school play.
I am all confused, I thought the martians had my glasses.
I must have had a dream, well no matter what, I never forget all those beautiful green eyes behind the lenses of my old glasses.
