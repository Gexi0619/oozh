How My Myopia Developed

As most people know these days, myopia is generally believed to be inherited.
It has been shown many times that it can be easily increased artificially after initially appearing.
This has been done by simply being over prescribed.. For instance, if the initial prescription
is -.50 and -1 is prescribed it is a very good chance the person will adapt to the -1 just by putting
it on and wearing. The eyes of a young person have quite a bit of accommodation.
After wearing the over prescribed glasses for a very short period of time their eyes will adapt
completely to the -1 and keep going on to more minus. The original "real" prescription will no
longer give adequate correction. At the next examination they will likely need at least -2 for full
correction. Prescribing -3 will repeat the cycle and the next time it may be -4 or more and so on.

This is what happened to me. When I was about 7 years old I noticed it was becoming harder to
see the blackboard at school from my usual seat in mid room. One day after I got home I told my
Mom about this. Now, she never wore glasses but I knew she had them. She was slightly
nearsighted just like my Dad. Anyway she went and got her glasses from her dresser and told me
to put them on. I did and the world came into instant focus again. I told her this and she said I
could use them all I wanted around the house. I walked around enjoying what I had been missing
for a year or so. After awhile I decided to read a book. Alas, it was impossible. It was too blurry.
I told my Mom this and she said to pull them down on my nose some. This helped a little.
At least I could read now even if it was still blurred somewhat. I wore her glasses every moment
when I was home. After about a month or so I noticed that I could read with them on and pushed
up all the way. This went on for about a year, all the time I was struggling with blurred vision
at school. Finally the school nurse sent a note home after the annual all school vision screening.
My Mom made an appointment at the eye doctor for me. I came away the with -2.50. He scolded
my Mom for not bringing me in sooner. After about 6 months I noticed things getting a bit fuzzy
again. One day when my Mom was gone, I went and got her glasses and put them on over mine.
Everything came back to instant focus except the same old "can't read up close" thing was back.
I went along like that for about a year, wearing her glasses over mine all the time when she
wasn't home. About this time I noticed a developing desire to always have stronger and thicker
glasses. At my next exam I got another increase, up to -3.75 this time. All was well again but
every once in awhile I would try my Mom's glasses over mine to see how I was doing. One day
when I went in to get her glasses I noticed she had a new pair of shoes laying on the floor by
the dresser. They had the highest heels I had ever seen on a pair of women's shoes. I stared.
I stared some more. All of sudden I got a tingling in my crotch and an overwhelming desire to try
them on. I kicked my shoes off and put hers on. Standing up carefully was so thrilling I got an
instant hard on. I took a few steps and was hooked. I felt like I had to wear heels forever.
They fit perfectly and were very comfortable. I felt like I had worn heels all my life. I spent the
next hour just walking around the house being careful to keep on the rugs so she wouldn't
detect any wear on the bottoms.
After 6 months this time I was due for another prescription increase. The doctor expressed
surprise that I was starting to increase more rapidly. This time it was up to -4.75. I got one
pair of normal single vision and one pair of bifocals this time to try and slow the progression.
I was to use the bifocals at school and for homework, the others everywhere else. Of course
the first thing I did when I got home alone was to put on my Mom's heels and try both pair of
glasses together. It was amazing. Everything was so crisp and super sharp. Slightly smaller
but nothing that bothered. I also noted that I could now read easily due to the bifocals in one
pair. A new thing to do was hatched. With the sensation of the super sharp vision and the
sensation of the heels combined, it was only about 3 pulls to masturbate off.
My glasses prescription kept going up all the time and I kept wearing 2 pairs at the same
time as often as I could. All of this continued for about 2 years when I outgrew my Mom's
shoes. At the time I had a girl friend that had an enormous closet full of shoes of all styles.
She didn't know of my passion for heels. One day I asked her how she could afford so many
shoes just being a high school student with a part time job. She said she got them at second
hand stores. There were several second hand stores within walking distance of home so I
decided to give them a look one Saturday. They had many shoes in the women's section that
I liked but I wasn't sure of my women's size now that I had outgrown my Mom's. She wore a 7
so I figured I was about an 8 at least. I noticed one of those size measuring tools laying on a
chair so I tried it and noted my size on the women's side. 8 1/2 B. A very common size and
there were many on the shelves in that size. I found a pair with very high heels and round toe
that I really liked and the price was only a dollar. I checked out and headed home. When I got
there I noticed my Mom was home early. Now what to do with the shoes? She saw me coming 
so I was trapped. I had to go in. She asked what was in the sack. I said just some stuff from
school. In her bouncy, friendly, joking way she said let me see. Oh, wow, what to do but let
her see. She said, what are you doing with women's shoes? Then she said without hesitating,
OH MY, do you like to wear women's shoes? I stammered yes. She grinned and said, that's ok
with me as long as you stay in the house with them. You have nice taste in shoes also and by
the way don't let your Dad see you with them. WOW, I was sure relieved after that.
My desire to always have stronger thicker glasses kept me busy watching for ways to increase
my myopia faster. I forget the exact time frame but I think I was up to about -8 by now. I had
been getting lenses with the industrial thickness since I got one broken in shop class. This was
a help for getting thicker lenses but I always wanted thicker. After I got out of high school and
started college I was up to around -12 but I always wanted more. I had learned about prism
lenses in my second year college physics class. I went to the library and read all I could about
prism correction in eyeglasses. Along with this was information on crossed eyes or strabismus.
I had never seen anyone with prism in their glasses so all I knew was what pictures in the books
showed. My glasses were already about 1/2 inch thick on the edges so I figured that adding
base out prism of about 8 would add another 1/4 inch to the outer edge making the lens about
3/4 inch thick. I could live with this. Boy, could I ever! The problem now was how to get a
prescription with the prism included. I went to a different eye doctor than my regular one and
got a current prescription. In those days they were hand written with the newly invented ball
point pens. It was no problem finding a pen that was the same color as the ink on the
prescription. As always the prism part of the prescription was left blank if there was none.
After practicing awhile to duplicate the writing style on the paper I filled in the prism amount
as 8 and the direction as BO (base out). I had no idea how I was going to adapt to this
amount of prism but I had experimented quite a bit with the prism's in the physics lab to
know that it would probably be ok with some adaption time. I took the forged prescription to
nearby town and found a likely looking optician's store and went in. I had an old but new
appearing frame I wanted the new lenses in. It was a large metal type aviator style frame that
would show the maximum amount of edge thickness. The girl behind the counter tried her best
to talk me into a different frame but I insisted. After about a week I went and retrieved the new
glasses. I about went off in my pants when I saw them in the tray. The girl fit them and I left.
I sat in the car looking at the slightly crosseyed image in the rear view mirror for about 10
minutes before I came to my senses. Now I started looking around to see how vision was with
the prism's. Pretty much normal except for a slight 3D effect with some colors. I looked over
the tops and noticed that I was seeing double for a few seconds before things went back to
normal. This turned me on instantly. I headed home. I noticed most things I looked at were
normal except that traffic lights had a 3D sort of halo around them. Understandable what
with prism's breaking up the light spectrum like they do. I really liked what I saw and decided
I wasn't going to have a bit of trouble with the prism's. I had a few comments from friends
about how my glasses had gotten so thick lately but I dismissed them as too much late night
studying. By the next time I went home for a few days, I was up to -14.50. My Dad didn't
say anything because he was used to my thick glasses. He may not have even noticed.
My Mom noticed the added edge thickness instantly and the slightly crossed eyes. She said, are
you going blind? I laughed and said no. No problems. Just some slight strabismus from all the
close work at school. She asked if I had any new shoes. I said no, I hadn't had much time for
that what with all the school work. She said my Dad was going to be gone on business for a
couple days so I could indulge while here all I wanted. Wow, what a Mom she was.
I forgot to mention earlier but after I learned to forge prescriptions, I always bumped mine
every time I got a new one so I always had super crispy vision. I was wearing trifocals now so
there was no problem with reading. My myopia progression had pretty much come to a stop by
now so increasing the prism was the only alternative to getting thicker glasses or so I thought.
After increasing the prism to 12 bo I met a girl at a party one night that was studying optical
physics with the idea of getting into the newly forming space exploration agency. She had a
part time job in a lab that made eyeglass lenses. Besides hitting it off romantically right off the
bat we had many long discussions about generating lenses. I blabbed all my inner feelings to her
about glasses and women's shoes and she told me about hers being thick glasses also. That was
why she was studying optics in school. I had noticed from the beginning that she always wore
very high heels so when we were discussing this she said she had never thought of it as a fetish
item. She just liked the feel of them and the way it made her ass wiggle. That was fine with
me. (heh heh) Anyway, she said it would be no problem to get over size blanks and make up a
set of lenses in my prescription that were at least an inch thick. I had her make them and put
them in a new frame. They are the ones I have currently and I really get excited looking at them
in the mirror. I didn't find out till after I got them that she had decentered the lenses as much
as possible so there were several more prism diopters added. I now appear extremely crosseyed
to look at me. I see perfectly normal as always though. When I take my glasses off my eyes turn
in instantly to look at the side of my nose and being so nearsighted I can count the pores in the
side of my nose.
This Saturday night I am going to ask her to marry me. I think she is a keeper.
