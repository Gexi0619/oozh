She found my glasses collection #1  (Sadie)

Writing prompt 1, September 2020
My blood froze instantly, when, I realized too late, my secret would be revealed, and I could not stop her anymore.
She had just opened the cabinet in my bedroom, which kept hidden,
my huge collection of prescription glasses, an undesirable testament, to my optical obsession.
There was no way I could get away without telling her, and I could only wait for her reaction,


Jim, what are all these glasses doing in your cupboard?
Sadie, that is a long story, and I will tell you all about the glasses.
Are these glasses, the ones you have worn, before your present pair? 
Yes, some of them are,
I notice, there are even some women’s style glasses, where did you get all these glasses, and what are you going to do with all of them?

Why don’t we go out for dinner right now, like we had planned, so I can tell you all about my glasses collection.
Yes, I would like to go for dinner, in a minute or so, but I am so fascinated seeing all those glasses, and I want to have another good look.

Jim, you know, I like the look of a person who wears glasses, that is one of the things, I found attractive about you, when we met., but you always wear the same glasses, so what are you doing with all these glasses?

Why don’t you sit on the bed, and I will explain to you, why I have all these glasses.
Just a minute Jim, I just noticed something, that I like to have another look at.

There was Sadie, browsing through all the women’s style glasses.
Where did you get all the women’s glasses?
My aunt, has three teen age daughters, and they all are wearing glasses, that is where the glasses come from.
Yes, I have noticed, that all the glasses are current style frames, by the looks of it.

Why, all the labels on the glasses?
On each label, I have written, the strength of the prescription., and where they came from.
So you know which have the strongest, and which have the lowest prescription. I like it that way.

Why do you collect glasses?
Well, Sadie I will tell you, as you have noticed, in this family, we all wear glasses.
Since I am the youngest in the family, I was the last one, to start wearing glasses, and I always wanted to be, like the rest of them, and wear glasses, so I really, wanted to wear glasses.

There always, were a number of glasses in our house, and I soon found some old glasses, that I could wear, and at an early age, started to keep, all the found glasses, in my drawer, and that is the time, when I started my glasses collection.

When I got older, and I learned more about vision and glasses, 
I bought an old lens-so-meter, which enabled me to find the prescription of each lens, that is why there is a label on each pair of glasses, to tell me the prescription, and where they cane from.

How come, you are not working in the optical field?
My dad, always wanted me to take over his accounting business, and I like working with figures, so the glasses collection, became my hobby.
I like my hobby, and it is not costly, because all the glasses. are used ones.

Now, I understand, why you collect glasses, do you have a glasses fetish ?
I guess you might be right, I love eyeglasses, to wear, and to look at,
yes, I might have a glasses fetish.

Sadie, you told me you like the looks of glasses on a person., why are you not wearing glasses?
Yes, you are right, I never thought about glasses for myself, 
I don’t even know, how I would look wearing glasses.

Well, I can help you there, here are some low prescription glasses, that you can try, and when wearing them, you will be able to see reasonably well.

I handed Sadie, some very low prescription type glasses, to try, and 
mentioned, I have a great big mirror on my dresser, so she can look at yourself.

Sadie, tried the glasses, while I watched, she looks fantastic wearing glasses, and when looking at her, wearing the glasses, sure got me aroused.
Jim, I did not know, that I could look this good wearing glasses,
I like the frame, that I am wearing now, and I am surprised how well I can see, wearing the glasses.
I expected, that you would not have any problem seeing, the prescription is lower than -1.00, about the weakest prescription in my collection
Jim, please let me try, the little stronger prescription, I like to find out what they are like, and how well I can see wearing them, you must realize, that you have me all excited.

Jim, I am having so much fun, trying, and wearing the glasses . 
I feel so, I don’t really know, how to phrase it, but wearing the glasses, does something to me, wearing the glasses makes me feel so I don’t know, how to say it., 

She did not realize, how excited I was, when I handed her a pair of glasses, with, a little stronger prescription.
After she put the glasses on, and looked around said, Jim I like these glasses better,. 
Everything I look at, looks so nice and clear and well defined, I can’t believe how well I can see, wearing theses glasses.

To my enjoyment, Sadie kept wearing the glasses, and looking at herself in the mirror, I think she is starting, to like wearing
glasses.

Jim, come over here, I want to find out what it feels like to be kissed, when wearing glasses.
Next thing I knew, I was in a strong, embrace kissing Sadie, and we kissed, like we had never kissed before.

Jim, I like to wear these glasses when we go for dinner to night, would you mind?
Sadie, you can wear the glasses all you want, I think you look beautiful wearing glasses.

When we were driving, to our favourite eating place, Sadie kept telling me, how she likes wearing the glasses, and how well she can see now.
I loved hearing that, I now realize, Sadie, most likely is myopic, so she will be wearing glasses all the time 

Having dinner, while looking at Sadie, wearing glasses, I got so worked up, I had to excuse my self, to go and relieve myself.

What a night, I still cannot believe, how well things went, after Sadie, discovred my collection of glasses, and my fetish for glasses.

The next time Sadie and I were together, Sadie wanted to see my glasses collection again.
She wanted to have another look, at all the women’s glasses.
When I asked her, if she wanted to see, any particular pair.
No Jim, I would like to try a little stronger prescription, you have one frame that I really like the looks of, and I think the glasses might have a higher prescription, I like to find out,f I can wear them, and see properly, wearing those glasses.

She went over to my collection, and came back, with a real nice frame, with a -3.00 and -2.75 prescription.
I really like these glasses, they look so nice,.
Well, go ahead and give them a try.
Sadie put the glasses on, and looked around.
Jim let’s go and see a movie, so I can give the glasses a real try.

We were just nicely seated, when the movie started, and Sadie was busy trying to find out, which pair of glasses she liked best, for good vision.
Jim, why do I love wearing the stronger glasses?
Well ,Sadie, I think, you now have a glasses fetish, and you want to wear nice strong glasses.
Yes, I think you are right, I really, like the looks of glasses on me, but love the looks of stronger lenses.
Can I train my eyes to adjust, so I can see properly wearing stronger lenses.
Yes, you are young enough, that we can give it a try, to induce more myopia, but I think, you should have an eye exam first, to get a proper prescription.

Three days later Sadie and I are on our way to the optical store, for her eye exam, we both are excited.
When we walked into the optical store, Sadie could not wait to try different frames., but could not, because she had to have her eye exam first
After the exam, I looked at her prescription, and was surprised, to read OD,-1.75, OS, -2.00, and all the important measurements.
Sadie looked at all the frames, but I suggested we order glasses for her on line.

Sadie’s glasses glasses, arrived, and now she could wear her glasses, and I had ordered the same frame glasses, with stronger prescriptions, so she could try to induce more myopia.


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Four years later

Sadie, and I have been married for three years now, and at Sadie’s last eye exam, had a big increase in her prescription, it now reads, OD, -3.75, OS. -4.00.
She loves the looks of her new stronger lenses, and she asked me for a big kiss, and thanked me, for showing her my collection of glasses, and make her a happy glasses wearer.
