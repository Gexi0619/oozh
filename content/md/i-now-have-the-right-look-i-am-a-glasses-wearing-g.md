Now, I have the right look, I am, a glasses wearing girl.


When you are the only girl, and the youngest, with two older brothers, you listen to a many of their conversations, this way a girl finds out, what to day’s guys like, and what they don’t like, 
This to me, is very important information. 
When you know, what guys really like, makes it easier to look just the way, they like to see you, for a chance to meet someone, you might like.


Sadie, is my name, I am 16, I sure like to go out on a date, and wear make up, and always make sure my hair looks nice, so I look as good as possible.


I spend a lot of time, reading all the fashion magazines, to find out about new styles, and trends, and make sure I do the right thing.
Lately I have noticed, that, quite a few, of the girls, used in to day’s advertising, are wearing glasses, and how nice they look 
I have read, that glasses, now, are a fashion statement, what, if you don’t need to wear glasses?
I have noticed, a few girls at school, who are wearing fake glasses.
As far as I am concerned, you should only wear, real prescription glasses.


One of my girl friends, just started to wear glasses, and I think, she looks fantastic.
She let me try her glasses, and I could see really well, wearing her glasses, but I have no idea, what I look like, wearing glasses.


My long time friend, Sarah, asked me to day, to come along with her, because, she is due for an eye exam, Saturday morning, I told her sure, then we can do some shopping, at the mall afterwards. 


To day, I heard my brothers, discuss a couple of girls, who are wearing glasses, and I cannot believe it, they like the looks of girls, who wear glasses, they prefer the stronger prescriptions, when, the lenses show rings, and make the eyes look smaller.
Now, I am starting to wish, that I need to wear glasses,


When Sarah, and I, entered the optical store, Sarah, did not have to wait long, for her eye exam to start.
I looked around, at all the frames on display, and when I saw, another person trying frames, to see how they looked, I, got up the nerve to try some frames.
Looking at myself, every time, I tried another frame, noticed, that some frames look so nice on you, and other ones, sure do not.
When, ,I liked, the frame I was wearing, I took a selfie.
I was so involved, trying on frames, that I did not realize Sarah, was standing, beside me.
You look fantastic wearing glasses Sadie, now it is my turn,
I am prescribed, to wear glasses, please, help me, select a perfect looking frame.
We found a nice frame, for Sarah, and about two hours later, Sarah, was wearing new glasses.
When, I tried her glasses, was surprised, how well I could see,
should I be wearing glasses?


I have done, a lot of reading, about vision and glasses, on my computer, and about myopia, and stronger lenses.
After, looking at some of the selfies, I took the other day, convinced me, that, I want to wear glasses.


What a pleasant surprise I got, when I was told, to come back,
when, I was wearing my glasses. After, I went to get my drivers license, and I flunked, the vision test


I was all excited, when, I went for my eye exam, and was prescribed to wear glasses, for myopia, and I feel lucky, because my prescription is high for a first time, I am -1.75, and -2.00.
I love my glasses, and, my glasses wearing look, and wearing the glasses, sure, made me feel more confident..
Now, I feel, have the right look, I am a glasses wearing girl.


After ,wearing my glasses for a while, I now, would like, to wear glasses, with stronger lenses, that show some more rings, and think I know, that the only way to do it, is to induce more myopia, by wearing, a stronger prescription
I placed an order on line, for a pair of glasses, but increased my prescription 2 diopters, on each eye.
When I received the glasses, I sure liked the looks of the lenses, the lenses show more rings, and I was surprised about the thickness at the edge of the lenses. 
I started to wear, my stronger glasses, every chance I had, and soon ,was wearing the glasses at school, my vision was great. and I hated to change, to my regular glasses.
When, I had my 6 month check up exam, my new prescription, was increased, one diopter on each eye, and I had new lenses, put in my glasses..


When, I was wearing, my new, stronger glasses, my brothers told me, they like the looks, of my new glasses, because, the lenses, in my new glasses, looked stronger now.
I loved to hear that, perhaps, I can make myself more myopic, so I kept, wearing my -4.00, glasses,.while waiting, for my – 5.00 glasses, to be delivered., 
When, my new glasses came, I was surprised to see, the how thick the edges of my lenses were, but loved the look, of the stronger lenses.
Surprisingly, within a week, I was completely used, to wearing 
the -5.00 , prescription glasses, and wore the glasses, every chance I had, until I was due, for my next eye exam.


Lately, I have more dates, and I love, all the attention I am getting,, because, I wear glasses now, and that guys, love my glasses wearing look, but I still, have not found a guy, that I really like.


To day, after I came home from school, I forgot, to take my -5.00 glasses off, when I came home.
My mother asked me, was I wearing new glasses?
I told her, that I had ordered the glasses on line, but they had used a different type of lens, which changed, the looks of my glasses, and made the glasses, look stronger.
Now I wear the -5.00 glasses full time, and my brothers, have told me, how they like my new glasses.


Now, I think, I have to make, a big decision, do I want to keep on inducing myopia, or see what happens, after my next exam, wearing my – 5.00 glasses.


I have, finished High school, and like to become an optician, I will have to move, to the city, where the college is.
When, I went there, to inquire about the course, I, looked around town, and was lucky, that, a large optical business in town, hired me, 
It is almost, like a scholarship, they will schedule my hours, so I can take the course.
When, I started to work, I had an eye exam, and my prescription, went up to -5.75, and now, I have nice, new high index lenses, in a very nice, designer frame.
I had not expected to be that myopic,. 
The optometrist mentioned, that it most likely, be another three, or four years, before my myopia, will stop increasing, nature will decide.
My new glasses, look fantastic, I love them. 


My first day, of the optician course, I met my class mates.
There is one girl, who in my opinion, is the most beautiful, glasses wearing girl, I have ever seen.
I was lucky, to meet her, because her personality, is as nice as her looks, and I want to be her friend..
I was lucky, she must, like me, because, when I asked her, to go and have a coffee with me, she accepted..
Sarah, and I, had a wonderful get together, her dad is an optometrist, and has a large optical store, and wants Sarah, to take over the practice.


When, we talked about glasses, Sarah, told me, her prescription is -7.50, and she, also loves wearing her glasses.
She told me, that her dad, had rented an apartment for her.
But, wanted her to work part time, in another store, to give her more experience.
We were getting along so well, that we are, meeting for dinner, on Saturday night.


After, an enjoyable dinner, and a lot, of pleasant conversation. Sarah, and I, now know each other a little better, and she invited me, for a drink, in her apartment


When, we sat down, to enjoy our drink, I asked her, if I could try, her beautiful glasses.
I will do better than that, and she went, to her bedroom, and when she came back, handed me a pair of her spare glasses,
After I put the glasses on, I took me a while, to be able to see reasonable well.
Sadie, you look fantastic, you look so nice, wearing the stronger lenses, so I got up, to look at myself, and loved the looks, of the stronger lenses.
I wore the glasses, while we had another drink,, 
Sarah, snuggled up to me, and then, put her arm around me, and gave me a hug.
I was so comfortable, and enjoyed, every minute, of our close encounter, wearing Sarah’s – 7.50 glasses.
After another drink, and snuggling up, our hands went to each others 
hot spots, and we were in seventh heaven.


I took a taxi home, and fell into my bed.
The following morning, I realized I was still wearing Sarah’s -7.50 glasses, but, I needed my own glasses, to wear, before I went back to work.


Sarah, was expecting me, and after I made sure I had my own glasses, Sarah, said you can keep the glasses, if you like them,
you look so nice, wearing, the stronger, prescription glasses.
I like that, I love to wear, your glasses, and soon, I, will be as myopic, as you are.


After that night, that we both, enjoyed so much, the visit, became a regular routine, Pizza, and wine, and a good time.


At my next. eye exam, my prescription, went up to -6.50, and I sure, like the looks, of my new glasses


Time goes fast, and we finished our course. 
Sarah’s father, offered me a job, in his practice, and welcomed me, Sarah, must have filled his ear.
I, now, live in their apartment, and Sarah, and I, like sleeping together.
A whole new life, all, because, I have the right look, I am a glasses wearing girl, and love it.
