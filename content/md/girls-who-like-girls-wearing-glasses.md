My name is Kate.
I am an average  looking girl , with blondish hair.
I have two older sisters.
In the fall I will be going back to high school.
I have a very silly kind of weakness, I love eyeglasses.
I would like to wear glasses, but I don t need them.
I don t know why I like glasses, nobody in our family wears glasses.

My close friend is Ashley, we have been friends since grade 3.
Ashley called me and wondered if I would like to go to the mall with her.
I told her yes, any special reason.
All she said was you will see.
When we arrived at the mall , went to the optical store.
I got all excited , all those lovely glasses.
Ashley went to the counter and told the lady she was here to pick up her glasses.
I did not know she was getting glasses, she had never told me.
When the optician had fitted the glasses, Ashley stood up and looked at me.
You look fantastic wearing glasses, I am so jealous, why not me?

Ashley then told me her mother had insisted she have an eye exam, she was sure I needed glasses, and she was right.
I notice a great improvement in my vision, and I like my new look.
I told her gain how lucky she was , you always knew I wanted to wear glasses.
The optician must have over heard our conversation , because she told me that i could wear glasses without a prescription in any frame I liked.
I had never thought of that, but I could not afford the glasses at the optical store.
Ashley mentioned there was a boutique in the mall that sold glasses with plain lenses.
We went to the boutique where they had a nice display of glasses.
After trying them ell,I decided on a frame  that both Ashley and I agreed on looked nice.
I bought the glasses , and put them on and was so happy, I was wearing glasses now.

When I came home , my mother wanted to know all about my glasses.
So I told her that I liked glasses , and wanted to wear them.
She thought it was all right , if it made me happy.
My sisters teased me , and I told them they were jealous, my dad told me I looked cute.
That is the day that I started to wear glasses.

At school all the other kids thought I looked good wearing glasses.
There are so many  of them wearing glasses now , that nobody seemed to look at the lenses.
I was accepted as a full time glasses wearer , that made me happy.

A while later , I discovered a good display of reading glasses in a drug store.
I tried them all, but in most of them the lenses were to strong.
Then I saw a pair I really liked , with + 1.00 lenses.
They were great for reading , but everything in the distance was a little blurry.
I loved the frame so much , that I bought the glasses.
When I came home my mother told me she liked my new glasses, nobody noticed the lenses were different.
After wearing the glasses for a couple of weeks my vision was perfect.
I also noticed that when I took my glasses off my distant vision was not as clear.

When I finished high school I was wearing + 1.50 drugstore glasses.

After graduating from high school I started to work in an office.
I liked my job, the pay was good and I had benefits.

Later I started a night school course in office management., which I thought might help me in the future .
Our teacher is a very pleasant , glasses wearing woman .
I like her as a person , and the way she teaches.

Since I have benefits now , I arranged for an eye exam.
I was really excited my first eye exam.
After the exam ,the optometrist gave me my prescription.
it read + 2.00 for the right and + 2.25 for the left eye and I had some astigmatism.
I selected a nice frame .
When my glasses were ready and I put them on was very pleased with my new look.
I loved the looks of my eyes behind the lenses, they looked so much bigger and brighter now.

After the next night school class , I wanted to ask my teacher a question.
When I approached her , she commented how nice I looked wearing my new glasses.
I thanked her and then asked my question.
She stood up ,and pointed at a special page in our book.
She was standing very lose to me , and when I looked at her, a most beautiful feeling came over me.
She looked so beautiful, and her eyes behind the lenses in her glasses , were so kind and inviting.
I never had that feeling before.
That night in my bed, when I was playing with myself, all I could see was her beautiful face.

The following week , when my class was finished , the teacher asked me to wait for her.
She invited me to have a drink with her.
We went to a nice restaurant and had a cup of coffee.
She told me not to be formal and call her Nancy.
Then she told me again how she liked my glasses , ans did I like wearing glasses?
I told her that I loved wearing glasses , and was hoping some day to have quite a few pair , so I could choose  which ones to wear.
She the told me sa had 3 more pair, and if I like to see nd try them , to come over Saturday morning to her apartment.
I told her I would love to try all her glasses.
When we were finished we both reached for the check at the same time , and ended up holding hands .
I loved that feeling.
Since Nancy had invited me she was going to pay the bill.
When we parted to go home , she gave me a hug and a kiss, I almost melted.

When I went to Nancy s place on Saturday, I was all excited.
I did not know what to expect , but I loved that woman /
She opened the door with a big smile on her face, and after taking my coat off gave me a big hug., and told me how glad she was to see me.
After sitting on the sofa, and enjoying a cup of coffee  ,she invited me into her bedroom  to look at her glasses.
The bed room was very nice and we walked over to he make up table where her glasses were.
She invited me to try her glasses,, to see how I looked wearing them.
I chose a nice multi colored frame and put them on.
Nancy s prescription was slightly stronger than mine , but I had no problem seeing when wearing them.
Looking in the mirror  I loved the looks of the glasses.
Nancy stood behind me with her hand on my shoulder and told me how she loved the way I looked.
When I turned around to face me she gave me a big kiss.
I gave her a kiss , and we hugged and kissed and before we knew it were on the bed.
It was not long there after that i found out what lesbian sex was like, and I loved it.

Later in the afternoon I phoned my mother and told her I would not be coming home that night
I was staying at a friends place and not to worry about me.
We had a fantastic Saturday and all day  Sunday .
When I came home Sunday night, I had a big smile on my face.
I was in love.
My mother asked me if I had a good time ?
I told her I had a new friend , and that we had a wonderful time.

A few weeks later my mother suggested I should bring my new friend over for Sunday dinner, they would like to meet him.
So I asked Nancy.
She accepted and the following Sunday I brought her home.
My parents were very surprised , they had expected me to bring hoe a boy not a girl.
Nancy was so pleasant and personable , that soon every body liked her 
Now my parents understood my feelings and respected them.
A short time late I moved in with Nancy.
We get along very well.
She loves seeing me wear her glasses , and sex is great,
And once and a while we still go to my parents place for Sunday dinner.
