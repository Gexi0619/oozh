Hi all, thought you might enjoy this story by moi. It is really mostly true, but is here in fantasy as feel it the best place for it.

It’s now 9PM on Thanksgiving night and here I sit at the computer looking through the bottom half of my glasses at this page of text and wondering why I let my obsession with the bifocal bug get to this point.

I seem to remember not having been struck by the bug even about my vision until I was in my 20’s. Until then, glasses had been merely a necessary tool in life. Although from age 9 to 14, a tool with which I avoided like the plague, even though I really should have been wearing them cause my nearsightedness was getting worse.

But, then I got my glasses and wore them just like most people, not really interested in the hows and whys and love of them. Then, for some reason which honestly escapes me now I became interested in all this. As I got interested in the subject, I realized my eyes were worse than most normal people and kept being fascinated.

During this phase, at some point, the bifocal bug first bit me and it bit me hard. I was only 24 or 25 but got it in my head about wearing bifocals. I dreamed of them, and talked about them with a couple glasses enthusiasts keenly. I even ordered a pair back in the first days of the online optical days. The bifocals were rather thickish at that point, and while I did venture out to the mailbox with, they stayed tucked in their case for the most part.

An eye exam visit at 27 spoiled the fun for me. I was really keen and thought that at this visit, I would be rxed bifocals. I was excited, nervous, and anxious all at the same time. However, the visit revealed that merely that I should rest my eyes more and that there was no need for any additional correction.

To be honest, at this point, it was like being handed kryptonite. My love was gone, and suddenly I was excited about having normal eyes. I will also admit that there was other issues in life going on at this point, and that it quickly became an afterthought in my life.

I disposed of the bifocals in the trash dumpster behind my apartment and moved on with my life thinking all of this would become just a distant memory until….
(More to come  )
