So I’ve been posting a lot recently. Mostly because I went to a glasses shop recently to get new frames and I’ll be seeing my optometrist soon for a prescription adjustment. Whenever I run such errands, old memories of glasses stories tend to flood back at once. I have a lot of non-fiction stories to tell, some I have mentioned briefly and can elaborate on as well as many new ones. Thers’s so many on my mind I want to get off my chest that I don’t know where to start so I figured I’d ask you guys what you want to hear about most: 

-experiences trying on people’s glasses
-stories of friends/acquaintances/family when they first found out they needed glasses
-stories of friends/acquaintances trying to get by without glasses (sounds like it might belong in squint sightings, but I have full stories to tell on the matter) 
-how I found out I needed glasses 
-stories from the optometrist’s 
-how I found out I have a glasses fetish 
-close calls where people almost found out about my fetish who I was trying to hide it from 
-the one time I confessed my glasses fetish
-the few romances I’ve had with glasses wearers 
-fiction (I have one idea for a piece of historical fiction) 

Let me know what if any you want to hear
