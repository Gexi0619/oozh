My name is Timmy and I am going to tell you the story of the time my vanity truly affected me. My story starts when I was in 6th grade. It was the first day of school, and now that it was middle school we were allowed to pick our seats in class. Being the shy boy I was I chose to sit in the back row. At first this was fine but soon things were going to change. 

As it was a new school, I had to make new friends. Quickly, I had solid group of six friends: Aidan, Eric, Evan, and Ami and Molly. Every day at lunch we would eat together, and sometimes even did things on the weekend. Things were going really well socially, and sooner than we knew it, it was December break. 

When we came back in January, I returned to my seat in the back of the classroom, however now I noticed it was little bit harder to read the words my teacher Ms. Brealle wrote on the whiteboard. It wasn't too bad, If I squinted I could see well enough. Plus, the LAST thing I wanted was to have to need glasses. I was already pretty shy, and it would have been social torture to come in one day wearing glasses. Over the rest of the school year, my vision began deteriorating even more, but I never said a word to anybody. I just squinted and moved closer to objects to see them.  

The summer between 6th and 7th grade was not too hard as I didn’t need to do much seeing if you know what I mean. My friends and I did lots of swimming at the beach and made the most out of our time outside the classroom. Soon the summer was over and it was back to school for us. 

Just like the previous year, we were allowed to choose our seats in the classroom. Aidan, Eric, Evan, Ami, and Molly all wanted to sit in the back row, but from there I couldn't see a damn thing on that board. I begged them to move forward a new rows, claiming the back row was too hot, because it was right next to the window. Molly, Ami, Evan, and Aidan decided my reason was dumb and decided to still sit in the back row, but Eric was nice enough to join me a few row forward.

Over the course of the year my friends became suspicious that I was hiding my poor vision. They became very suspicious whenever we went to the movies and had to sit in the first few rows in order for me to able to see what was happening on the screen. At one point, Eric noticed how much I was squinting to see the board and offered to let me copy off his paper when we took notes. Without this offer I would have HAD to get glasses, which as I've said before was the LAST thing I wanted! I was able to manage the rest of the year doing this, and before I knew it, summer vacation had come. 

Towards the end of 7th grade, our group of six didn't hang out as often as we used to. Ami and Molly had began developing and started to hang out more with the other girls in our class. That summer, we still hung out occasionally as a six, but usually it was just me, Aidan, Eric, and Evan. We played video games at each others houses and I always had to sit super close to the TV to have a chance at being on par skill-wise with the others. By this point, I had mentioned how blind I was to them and they did their best to help me out so I wouldn't have to get glasses.

This assistance went on for the rest of 8th grade. At our school, part of the middle school graduation traditions was a class trip to the water park. It was this trip that finally made me decide to get an eye exam. The class trip was in May about 1 month before the actual graduation ceremony. By May, Ami and Molly's boobs had grown and they both easily filled a B Cup bra. The teachers had allowed us to roam the waterpark without adult supervision as long as we stayed in groups of either four or six. Aidan, Eric, Evan, Ami, Molly, and I decided to spend the day together. About half way through the day we found ourselves at the top of the largest waterslide in the park. Evan decided to go down first, followed quickly by Aidan and Eric. Next it was my turn and I had a blast sliding down the waterslide. The four of us waited at the bottom for the girls to come down. 

Now Ami had been wearing a bikini with a color similar to her skin, but as she exited the waterslide into the pool at the bottom, the force ripped it off her body and she lost it. Or at lest that's what I was told. As hard as I tried, I couldn't see what was happening. Aidan, Eric, and Evan all got a glimpse at Ami's tits while I got nothing. It wasn't fair that my eyes didn't work! As the water settled Ami was able to find her lost swimsuit and cover herself up. The whole really made me contemplate my vanity towards needing glasses. 

Reluctantly, when I got home I told my mom about my failing vision and she made me an appointment at the eye doctor. The next day I went to my appointment and was prescribed glasses to correct my nearsightedness. As I mentioned, glasses were the last thing I wanted to I also elected to get contact lenses. They had a prescription of -2.00 in my right eye, and -1.75 in my left. I chose a pair of glasses were cheap because I wouldn't be allowed to get contacts if I had chosen a more expensive frame. Putting contacts in for the first time was a surreal experience. I was actually able to see things more than 3 feet away. 

The following weekend, the group went to the movies and when I suggested we sit in the back my friends were shocked. I told them I got contacts and could finally see the movie screen from the back of the theater. When they asked why I gave a bullshit reason since the girls were around. After the movie when the girls were in the bathroom I told the guys that I got contacts because I couldn't see any difference in Ami's body when her bikini fell off. I missed her boobs. 

Soon it was graduation and it was such a nice feeling being able to look into the crowd from the stage and see my family clearly.
