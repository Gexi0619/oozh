I only love men, who wear glasses.


Hi, my name, is Ashley, I am in my second last year of high school, and I am a good student.
I am a brunette, with shoulder length, thick, wavy hair, brown eyes and I am well developed with a nice girly figure, and medium height.
Yes, I am very proud of my looks, and always very fussy when getting dressed, and with my hair, always trying to look my best.


My best friend, is Megan, we have been friends for a long time.
Megan, is a very, pretty girl, she has beautiful long blonde hair, that she wears most of the time in a ponytail, 
she has a nice oval shaped face, and bright blue eyes., she looks very cute wearing her brown, tortoiseshell cat eye glasses.
She has been wearing glasses, since she started high school, and her present prescription is -2.50.
I think, she looks beautiful wearing glasses, what I cannot believe is, that she really likes wearing her glasses.
Both of us like boys, and we both have regular dates.


Megan, likes tall athletic, muscled types of guys, like football players, I prefer the studious type,
medium height, glasses wearing guys.
Why, I don't know, all I know is I have always loved the look of men, who wear glasses..
A man, who wears glasses, to me looks more more approachable, more intellectual, and I like the way his eyes look behind the lenses of glasses. 
The perfect man to me, is of medium height, well developed, with nice hair, and he must wear glasses,
preferable, with a prescription for myopia, and I love it when the lenses show some rings.


Megan, and I discuss boys quite often.
She knows my preference, and has often told me, that a studious, glasses wearing guy, most likely prefers a studious glasses wearing girl.
I don't believe it, all I know is that Megan, does not have any problem, getting dates with the kind of guy she likes.
I have dates with the kind of guy, I like, but I never have more than, one or two dates.
Megan has told me before, that the type of guy, I want, most likely prefers a glasses wearing girl.
She has let me try her old and new glasses, so I can become a glasses wearing girl, but I cannot stand the looks of me wearing her glasses.
I don't think I want to wear glasses., not even to catch a guy, I like the way I look.


I have an older brother, Kyle, who is a couple of years older than I am.
He, is now a university student, and is taking the pre-med. course.
He just finished his first year with high marks.
After 2 more years he will get a degree, which enables him to study, to be a doctor, or dentist, optometrist, whatever he would like to be, in a medical or science profession.
Kyle, is a very handsome, rather tall, with nice hair, and a great personality.


Last night I heard him talk to my parents, telling them, that it was a tough year, with a lot of studying, and headaches. 
He asked my mother to make arrangements for him to have his eyes examined, he expects, he needs to wear glasses.
Now, I can't wait, to see Kyle wearing glasses.


On the day, of Kyle's eye exam, he asked me to come along, to help him select the proper frame.
I loved the opportunity, Kyle, should look fantastic wearing glasses.
When, we arrived at the optical store, Kyle did not have long to wait for his exam to start.
I started to look at all the glasses frames on display, with such a large choice of frames, everybody, should be able to look good wearing glasses.
Not, being able to resist the temptation, I tried some of the frames.
The optician, came over, and after looking at me, suggested some frames that I should try.
What a surprise, when I looked at myself, wearing some of the suggested frames.
I did not realize, I could look this good, wearing glasses.
Talking to the optician, was like an education, now I realize, why Megan looks so good wearing her style of glasses, because she has a different shaped face, then I have, face shapes make a lot of difference, for the type of glasses frame, that will look good on a person.
I sure learned a lot, the optician sure knew, what she was talking about.


When Kyle, came out the examination room, was carrying a slip of paper, that he handed to the optician.
He told me, he was prescribed glasses, could I help him select a good looking frame.
I asked the optician, to please help us, I knew she would suggest the right looking frame for Kyle to try.
I did not take us to long to find the right frame, and after the proper measurements had been taken, he was told the glasses would be ready for pick up, the next day.,


On the way home, I asked Kyle, if he was upset, having to wear glasses.
No, Ashley, I knew, I needed to wear glasses, and I am looking forward to wear glasses., because I know I need them.
I have a girlfriend, Amy, who wears glasses, and by the way, she looks fantastic wearing glasses.
Amy, has been wearing glasses, for some time..
She told me, that she was sure I was myopic, and brought me her first pair of glasses, and when I wore those glasses, could see so much better, and did not have as many headaches,
I am glad, that now, I will have my own glasses to wear.


That night in bed, I kept on thinking about all that had happened to day.
Me looking, quite nice, wearing some of the glasses frames, the opticians information, and that Kyle has a glasses wearing girlfriend, who loaned him a pair of glasses, and that now he is glad, he has to wear glasses, that sure was a lot of news, for one day.


The next, day when Kyle came home, wearing his new glasses, I could not believe my eyes,
He looked, fantastic, and his eyes behind the lenses seemed to sparkle, I am sure his girl friend will love his new look.
Because, Kyle is the first in our family to wear glasses, we all had to try the glasses.
When, I tried the glasses, was really surprised, how well I could see wearing the glasses, but I did not dare say anything.


Kyle, told us, that he had invited Amy, for a visit, to meet the family, my mother said, that will be great, she can sleep in Ashley's room,
where there are two beds.
I am looking forward to Amy's visit, she sounds to me like a very interesting girl, and be fun to talk to, about boys and glasses.


When, Amy, came and I looked at her, and had to agree with my brother, she sure is a beautiful, glasses wearing girl.
Looking at her glasses, I realized, they were a stronger prescription, because I noticed some rings, at the edge of her lenses.
She was delighted, when she saw Kyle wearing glasses and told him how nice he looked.
Kyle, said, Ashley and the optician made the choice for me, and I sure like my glasses.


Later on, when Amy, and I were in my bedroom, Amy told me, how she had noticed, Kyle needing glasses.
I even, brought the pair, that Kyle used to wear, during lectures in the auditorium, because, I had not expected him to greet me, to day wearing new glasses, I guess he wanted to surprise me, and he sure did.
Yes, Kyle told me, about using your old glasses, can I see those glasses?
Amy then pulled a pair of glasses, out of her purse, these are the glasses, he used.
After she handed me the glasses, I looked them over, and slowly put them on.
Ashley, you look good wearing glasses, that style of frame suits you.
I went over, to the dresser mirror, and looked at myself, Amy was right, the style of frame, looked very nice.
Then, I told her, that my weakness was, the looks of guys wearing glasses, she told me, what Megan had told me, that to catch that kind of guy, I should be wearing glasses, and look studious,. and sophisticated, myself.
Ashley, you look very attractive wearing glasses, do you think, you might need to wear glasses?
I was still wearing Amy's glasses, when I walked over to the window to look outside.
What a shock, I got, when I could see everything far away, so nice and clear, I never could before.
I stood there, and took the glasses off, and then put the glasses back on, and could not believe the improvement, in my vision, when I was wearing the glasses.
Amy, who had watched me said, I noticed, you just realized, that you need to wear glasses, am I right?
Yes, you are right, I cannot believe the improvement in my vision when wearing the glasses.
Well, the way you used the glasses, reminds me, of the day I started to wear glasses, the difference that wearing glasses makes, when you start wearing, glasses for the first time, is unbelievable, and you never forget the experience.
So, Amy asked, are you ready to start wearing glasses?
I now know for sure, that I need to wear glasses, but, I don't know, if I really want to wear glasses.
Ashley, there are many benefits when wearing glasses, besides seeing perfect, I always enjoy, removing my glasses, when in deep thought, because everything you look at far away, looks fuzzy.
Guys, like the looks of a girl wearing glasses, your eyes behind the lenses, look brighter, and you can take your glasses off, and then put them back on when talking to a person, you can look over the top of your glasses, and all kinds of other crazy things, a girl can do, to drive a man crazy.
With the large selection of frames available, everybody can look fantastic wearing glasses.
Then Kyle called Amy, to come down, he was ready to take her out.


Later that night, I sat in my room, and wore Amy's glasses, and then put them on, and off again, and enjoyed the experience, I now know, that I need to wear glasses, to see properly.
I called Megan, and told her my story, about Amy, and the glasses, and also about Kyle wearing glasses now.
Ashley, get your eyes examined, and start to wear glasses, you won't be sorry, and I am sure, and it won't be long, and you will love wearing your glasses.
Well, everybody, that I know, and wear glasses, don't seem to mind having to wear them, perhaps wearing glasses, is not all that bad.
I wore Amy's old glasses all night, and pretended they were mine, and I sure did appreciate, the improved vision, and realized glasses were very comfortable to wear.


The next morning, when I woke up, and looked on my night table, to see the time, I also saw two pair of glasses.
I got up out of bed, and by mistake took Amy's glasses and put the glasses on, on my way to the bathroom
Wearing Amy's glasses, I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror, I loved the looks of the stronger lenses, but when looking around could not see to well.
When, I returned to the bedroom, Amy, was sitting up, I can't find my glasses.
Sorry, I tried them, here they are.
Well, did you like them? I loved the looks of my eyes behind the lenses, but they are to strong for me to see properly.
Then Amy told me, the prescription, on her old ones, -1.25., these are, -3.75, that is the increase I had in three years.
I put Amy's glasses back on, and liked being able to see so well.
Amy, suggested, I wear the glasses, and surprise my parents, and Kyle, and she would explain, why I am, wearing the glasses.
So both of us got ourselves presentable, to go downstairs, to have breakfast.
They all looked at me, when they saw me wearing glasses, but Amy, sure knew how to convince them, that I needed to wear glasses, and that I should wear her old glasses, till I got my own.
They soon all agreed, and now, I officially, started to wear glasses.


The next day when I went for my eye appointment, was wearing the glasses, and forgot to take them off before I went into the examination room.
After my exam was finished, the optometrist told me, that I needed an increase in my present prescription,.
Amy, who had gone with me, looked at my prescription, and said, you sure need to wear glasses, 
your right eye, is -1.50, and your left-1.75, and you have some astigmatism.
It did not take us long, to find a frame I really liked, and was told the glasses would be ready this afternoon.
Now, I could not wait for my glasses to be ready.
Amy, later explained my prescription to me, and she thinks, in a few years my glasses, will be as strong, or even stronger, then her present glasses.


When, I put my new glasses on, noticed how much stronger they were than Amy's, that I had been wearing, and when Kyle tried my glasses, said, you sure needed to wear glasses, these glasses are stronger than mine.
When Amy saw my glasses, and tried them said, that is a strong prescription for a first pair of glasses, and you look so nice wearing the glasses, all the guys will be looking at you now. 
Now, that I can see so well, and so many nice comments, perhaps, I should be glad, I have to wear glasses.


I am now starting my last year of high school, and when my classmates noticed me wearing glasses, received some nice some nice comments, 
I noticed 3 other students in our class, are wearing glasses now.
Like, I had been told, start to wear glasses, and you will have lots of male attention, and I sure did.
I had my eye, on Kevin, the type of guy, I was looking for.
Kevin, wears glasses, he is myopic, I guess, his lenses look to be about -4.00, he is everything, I have been looking for.
He came over to me, and told me he how glad he was, to see me wearing glasses, and that I looked fantastic wearing glasses, and asked me for a date.
I was thrilled, and accepted his invitation to go and see a movie, Saturday.
Kevin, was a pleasure to go out with, he has a great sense of humor, and he told me, he loves the looks of girls wearing prescription glasses, 
and he had not noticed me, until I had started to wear glasses. 
I told him, that I loved wearing my glasses, and am looking forward to someday wear lenses that show some rings.
The stronger, the better, I like high prescription lenses, was Kevin's answer.
