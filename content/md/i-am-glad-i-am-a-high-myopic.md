I am glad, I am a high myopic




I am so fortunate, to be part of a happy family.
Dad has a good job, so my mother has time for her family
My name is Cindy, and I have two younger brothers.


To day coming home from school, I was told that dad, had a heart attack,
and has died.
That changed our lives completely.
My mom had to go to work, and while she is gone, I have to look after the house,
and my brothers.
I am very busy, I want to keep my marks in school, as high as I can.




Because I am now old enough, I now can take the course to get my drivers license.
There is one thing, I worry about, will I be able to pass the vision test.
I know my vision is not as good as it was, and in class always sit in the front.
so I can read what is written on the white board.




My friend Amber, has just started to wear glasses, and when she let me try her glasses, 
I knew, that I should be wearing glasses, I could see so much better when I was wearing
her glasses., I wished they were mine.


Knowing, that my mother has a hard time to pay all the bills, 
I do not want to tell her, that I think, I need glasses, I will make do as long as I can.




To pass the vision part of the eye exam, was made easy, because I borrowed Amber’s glasses, 
so I could see properly, to pass the test.
When we had our time, driving a car, the instructor asked me where my glasses were,
and I told the instructor, that I was wearing contact lenses.
I now have my drivers license, but no car to drive.


I realize, that I have developed ,all the right curves, in all the right places, and now am a tall,
good looking young women, with a beautiful head of hair.
Feeling very good about my looks, I was dreaming, perhaps someday, I can be a famous model,
and make lots of money.
In the little time, I have available during the day,, I look at fashion shows on my computer, and study,
studied and practise, how models walk,.and turn’
Borrowing a pair of my mother’s shoes, with heels, I try to walk the way models do,
it did not take me long, to walk I think, as good as any model in the shows.




To day I found out, that there is going to be a fashion show for students, at the mall.
Before the show, students have to show their performance, and will be judged, 
if their performance, is good enough to be in the show.
I must have put in a good performance, because I am a model in the show, 
and will be showing four different outfits. 


My mother wears glasses, for reading. 
When I found one of the first pairs that she wore. I tried the glasses, but they do not,
improve my vision., but I like the way, I look wearing the glasses,
and decided the glasses might come in handy sometime.




I am all set to perform, at the fashion show to night.
Being my first show, I was excited, and after showing my first outfit, and the response,
I received, I knew, that I was doing great.
When I dressed for my last outfit to show, I decided to wear mom’s old glasses.
It is hard to believe, but wearing the glasses, changed my life.
After the show, a gentleman, wanted to speak with me.
He told me, how impressed he was with my performance, and thought I looked great,
wearing the glasses.
What he wanted, is for me to be their model, but I have to wear glasses.
I told him, that would not be a problem, because I know I should be wearing glasses.
I suggested he talk to my mother, to get her approval.


My mother talked with Mr. Jones, and approved, because I needed to make some money, 
as she had, a hard time, to make ends meet, with the wages she made.


A part of my new job is. That I have to have an eye exam, and be prescribed glasses.
A whole new experience, my first eye exam., I am looking forward to it.
During the exam, trying to read the letters, sure improved when the optometrist, 
changed the lenses.
The optometrist asked me is this better, or shall we try this.
I did not know, that, Mr Jones, the owner of the glasses business, 
wanted me to become a high myopic, but I found out.




Now, I have my first pair of glasses, and when I put the glasses on, could not see as well,
as I had expected.
The glasses seem much stronger, then when I had tried Amber’s glasses.
The optician, told me to wear my glasses full time, and I would be able to see perfect, 
in a couple of weeks.
When I looked at my self in a mirror, noticed what looked like a ring at the edge of my lenses.
Being a good girl, I wore my glasses all the time, and as the optician had told me, 
and after about a week, I could see perfect wearing the glasses.




About six months later, I had another eye exam, 
When the optometrist was doing my exam, my boss, while whispering, asked the optometrist,
how strong my present prescription was.
The glasses she is wearing are -4.00, and I would suggest, we can add a couple of diopters, 
and we could use laser to speed up the increase.
She will soon get used to wearing the stronger prescription, she is is still young.
Now I know what was going on, but I have no choice, we signed the contract, and are receiving,
our money, that is more important, and I am wearing glasses, that I don’t have to buy,
and I can now see properly.


Now wearing the – 7.00 glasses, I noticed an increase in the thickness of the lens, at the edges,
my eyes look smaller, but for some reason, I like my new look, and wonder how my glasses are going to look,
after my next eye exam, when they most likely, add another 2 or 3 diopters




At my last prescription increase, I was handed two pairs of glasses, one pair with thin lenses,
and the other pair with lenses, much thicker at the edges.
I like wearing the glasses with the thicker lenses, because the way I look wearing them.


By the time , I was 20 years old, I was wearing -17.00 glasses
The lenses make it look, as if your eyes are small, and at the end of a tunnel, 
which shows the thickness of the lens. 
I never realized, I would be wearing glasses, with lenses that strong, but I love the looks of my new glasses,




I have a lot of pictures now, of me wearing glasses, and have saved all the old frames.




To day, I was notified that the company I worked for went bankrupt, and I am out of a job.
Now, being a high myopic girl, I am looking for a new job.
Most places where I went, had a good look at me, and turned me down.
I did not give up.
To day I had an interview, with the manager of a small company. 
Cindy, I would like you to come and work with us, and make our company grow.
Rick is my name, I think you will be the right person for the job.
I accepted, and will be starting my new job, the next day. 




It did not take me long to find out all about my job, because of Mary, an older glasses wearing lady,
who had been with the company since it started.
I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with.




I put a suggestion into the suggestion box, and afterwards wondered if I had done the right thing.
Not long after, I found out.




My boss Rick, came into the office, and suggested, I have lunch with him, to discuss my suggestion.



While we were enjoying our meal, Rick told me that his dad owned the business, but did not want to get involved,
running the company.
Then we discussed my suggestion, which he thought was very good, and will be acted on.
Shortly after, Rick told me how he liked, the looks of my glasses.
So I told him my whole story, of modelling and be a glasses girl.
Now, I remember where I have seen you before, I have seen your pictures in the paper and on T.V.
When I first saw you in the office, was sure I had seen you before, but could not remember where,
Cindy, I am so glad you are with us, you are smart and beautiful., I think you look beautiful wearing glasses.
Thank you, I am glad you like my look, I do, and I like working with you.




That was the start of our love affair, .
We are now married, and are expecting a baby girl, and I wonder if she will be wearing glasses.
I am glad, that I am a high myopic , all I have to do is look around, to see, all the good it has done me.
