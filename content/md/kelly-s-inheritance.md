Kelly was on her way to a solicitors office about 100 miles from her home in London
Kelly thought about the strange month she had just been through, it started when a letter from a London solicitor landed on her doormat. It was unusual be ause Kelly had never so much as returned a library book late  or done anything even the slightest bit wrong. 
When she read the letter it said her uncle Sidney had left her a sizable inheritance but she needed to bring proof of who she was to the solicitors office for the reading of the will.

Kelly arrived at the office of the solicitors and soon was in the office with a few other distant relatives some she recognised some not, then ìt was time to hear the will.

The solicitor sat at his desk and began to read. I Sidney Shmidt leave £5000 to my sister vicky and the rest of my fortune £2000000  and my clinic in shepherd's Bush to my niece Kelly.

Kelly gasped the money alone was enough to set her up for the rest of her life as long as she was careful but the clinic what sort of place was it how had uncle did run a clinic without the rest of the family knowing?

The rest of the relatives hot up to leave one of them giving Kelly an evil look.
Kelly asked the solicitor what sort of clinic it was you'll see he said here are train tickets to shepherd's Bush Station the clinic is in a large white building opposite, Kelly took the ticket would you like me to come with you? Asked the younger of the 2 solicitors now Present
Yes please said kelly
