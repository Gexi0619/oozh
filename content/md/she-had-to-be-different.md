She had to be different!


When I was about 6 years old, I started to notice, how large my grandparents eyes looked.
I asked my mother, why, when grandma, had such nice large eyes, and she did not have large eyes,
like grandma?
Brandon, the lenses of grandma s glasses, make her eyes look larger.
If you look around, you will notice, that not every person, wearing glasses, has larger looking eyes,
some eyes are smaller looking, it depends on what they call, the prescription of the glasses.
After that, I had a good look, at eyes, and anybody who wore glasses.
That made me decide, that if I had to wear glasses, I would want lenses, that made my eyes look bigger.


I am going into grade three after the summer,.
To day my friend, Kevin came over to play some games, after losing a few, he said, I am sure, you will not win this many games, after I get my new glasses.
Are you getting glasses?
Yes, my my mother took me for an eye exam to day, and I have to wear glasses,.
My new glasses will be ready to morrow, and I will come over, and show them to you.




Kevin, is going to wear glasses, I wonder, what his eyes will look like behind the lenses, larger, or smaller.
I wondered, what Kevin would look like wearing glasses, and will he like having to wear glasses.
What will the kids at school say?


The next day, as promised, Kevin came over to see me, wearing his new glasses.
Wow! He sure looked nice wearing glasses, and I noticed right away, that the lenses, made his eyes looked larger, lucky guy!
After I told him, how nice he looked wearing glasses, he let me try them.
When I looked in the mirror, knew right away, I wanted glasses, just like Kevin s.
My eyes looked so nice, a little larger, and I liked my look, of wearing glasses.
Kevin, told me, that he is farsighted, and has, I think they call it , a stigmatism., and that he 
has to wear the glasses all the time.
When we played some games, the glasses must have helped him, he sure beat me.


After Kevin left, to go home, I told my mother about Kevin s glasses, how nice he looked , and that he let me try them.
Brandon, never wear some ones glasses, it will ruin your eyes, forget about the glasses, you don t need glasses.
I went to my room, I know I want to wear glasses, just like Kevin.




At school, Kevin, and three other students in my class are wearing glasses now, and now I know, looking at their lenses, who is nearsighted,
I like learning, about glasses and lenses, and vision, on the computer, I start to feel like an expert.
What I would like to know, can you ruin your eyes, so you have to wear glasses.


A couple of years later, Kevin got new glasses.
He told me, that he had needed stronger lenses.
When Kevin, showed me his new glasses, I noticed how his eyes looked a little larger now, lucky guy.
When Kevin, let me try his glasses, I liked the look of my larger eyes, but looking around, everything in the distance looked very fuzzy.
Well, Brandon, you want to wear glasses, when are you getting glasses?
I don t know, my mother says, I don t need glasses.
When, I told her I had tried yours, she got mad, and told me, that trying other peoples glasses would ruin my eyes.
Well, why don t you ruin your eyes?
I don t know how, I would, if I could,
Yes, you can, I will give you my old glasses, you can wear them, and ruin your eyes..
I put Kevin s old glasses on, looked around, and surprisingly, could see almost perfect.
We played some games, and I am sure, I won some, because I was wearing Kevin s old glasses.




I wore the glasses, whenever I could, and realized, wearing the glasses, sure made reading a lot easier.
At school, I wished I could wear the glasses, I sure missed them.
My teacher, must have noticed, and asked me if I had trouble reading what was on the computer screen.
I told her, that I did, and sometimes get a head ache, when reading.
After school, she handed me a note, to give to my mother. 
When I came home, I handed the note to my mother, she read it, and said, I will have to discuss this with your father, to night.


The next day after school, when I was ready to go home, my mother, came to get me, 
She told me I had to go with her, for an eye exam.
What a surprise, I am going to get glasses.
I really, enjoyed the eye exam, and after the exam, with a smile on my face, carried my prescription , out of the exam room.
After the optician, read it, she told my mother, that I needed to wear glasses.
Well, I certainly, did not expect that, Brandon, we better find you a suitable frame. 
At last, with the assistance, of the optician, we found a frame, that I really liked.


I was so excited, when we went to pick up my glasses, will my eyes be bigger?
When, I was wearing my new glasses, and looked in the mirror, was so happy, to see my brown eyes 
looking a little larger,
When we came home, I went to see Kevin, to show him my new glasses.
He sure liked my frames, and when he tried them, was surprised, the lenses were, almost as strong as his.
Proudly, I wore my new glasses, to school.
When a few of the guys, made some remarks, I told them, how some people, just could not be jealous, without showing it.
My teacher, complimented me, and told me, she was glad to know, I would not have, any more reading problems.
My grades, improved, and I was a so happy, I was wearing glasses now, that made my brown eyes look larger.

I am now in my last year of high school.
The prescription of my glasses, is, +3.25, for the right, and + 3.50. for the left eye, and some astigmatism.
I am very proud, of my glasses, and wearing glasses, have made me feel, very confident.
Lately, I have had some dates, but have trouble finding the girl of my dreams.
The girl, of my dreams, a girl. that I would like, has to have, nice wavy, dark blond hair, a good figure, and of course, should have to wear, glasses, for hyperopia, and preferable blue eyes.
A guy, can dream, can t ,he?


                                                     Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx




There is a guy, in my year, but not my class, I would love to go out with.
I don t think , he has ever noticed me.
His name is Brandon, a very handsome, well built guy, he wears glasses, and has beautiful big brown eyes, I even dream about him.
When, I talked to my girlfriend Ashley, she told me , I have no idea, how I can help you.
Melanie be patient, you never know, I know, he likes girls.


I have been doing a lot of studying lately, and now also have more headaches.
My mother, came up to my room to night, and asked, if I had the bottle, of painkillers.
When I handed her the bottle, she asked me, why it was almost empty.
When I told her, that with all my studying, I had a lot of head aches.
Well, something has to be done about that.. 
The next day, when I came home from school, my mother told me, that she had checked, with some of her friends, and my headaches, might be a vision problem, and that I had an eye exam, on Saturday morning.
Me, an eye exam?
I don t want to wear glasses, that will spoil my looks.
The next day, at school, I told Ashley, about the eye exam.
Well, Melanie, I think you will look fantastic, wearing glasses.
Look around you, and see how many students wear glasses now, and how good they look, also, wearing glasses, might help you have fewer headaches.
You might not realize it, but a lot of guys, like glasses wearing girls..


Lying in my bed , Friday night, I was l very upset, about the thoughts of having to wear glasses.
When the following morning, my mother told me to get up, or you will be late for your appointment,
I hated to get up, out of my bed.


Walking into the optical store, all I could see,, were lots of glasses, and pictures of people wearing glasses, very scary.
The optician, handed me a clipboard, and asked me to fill out a form, with some questions..
Then, I was taken, to the examination room, and was asked to sit down,
I could not believe, that the optometrist, when she was finished, told me I need to wear glasses, and should wear the glasses all day.
She told me, that I have some astigmatism, and that I am farsighted, and wearing glasses, will reduce ,
and most likely, eliminate my head aches, but make sure you wear the all the time.
When I left the examination room, I was almost in tears.
I am so proud, of my looks, what will I look like, wearing glasses?
My mother looked at me, after I handed, my prescription to the optician, and said, I can tell by the way you look, you were told, you have to wear glasses.
Yes, and I have to wear them, all day.
Well, let us find you, a nice frame.
With the assistance, from the optician, we selected, a frame, that they all told me, would would make me look fantastic.
We were told the glasses would be ready about 2 o clock.


When, I put my glasses on, and looked in a mirror, loved the look, of my, blue eyes, behind the lenses.
Having, a good look at myself, realized, I looked pretty nice wearing glasses
Both the optician, and my mother, told me I looked beautiful.


When, I came home, both my dad and sister Kim, told me how nice I looked wearing glasses.
Kim, of course had to try my glasses, and said, if I can look this good wearing glasses, I don t think
I mind, having to wear glasses.
My friend, Ashley, when she saw me wearing my new glasses, said, I told you, you would look fantastic wearing glasses, and you sure do.


Now, my biggest hurdle, is going to school, on Monday wearing glasses.
Well, I was surprised, only a few comments, and all positive.
The glasses, are comfortable, so far no headaches, and I now realize, the glasses have not really spoiled my looks.
I might like, having to wear glasses.

To day, I heard some of the guys, in my class say, did you see Melanie, she wears glasses now, and you got to see her, she sure looks fantastic.
Melanie?, I think, I have seen her, she is not in my class, I better see, if I can get a good look at her, any girl wearing glasses, needs to be looked at.
At noon, walking into the cafeteria, I spotted, a girl wearing glasses, I could not believe my eyes, I am sure, she is Melanie.
She looked at me, and I saw, the most beautiful, glasses wearing girl, I had ever seen.
I could not believe my eyes, she looked like the girl of my dreams.
She gave me a big smile, so I walked over to her, and told her how nice she looked wearing glasses.
I introduced myself, and asked if she would mind, if I joined her.
She smiled, yes please sit down, Melanie, is my name.
We had a very pleasant conversation, until classes started again.
I asked her for a date, and she accepted.


Brandon, was all dressed up, when he went to Melanie s place, to pick her up, for their first date.
He was invited, into the house, and met Melanie s parents, and her sister Kim.
When they were in the car, on their way, to see a movie, Melanie, told Brandon, he had passes the test, 
If her parents, did not approve of her date, she would have been told, to stay home.
We had a great night out, and made plans, for the following Saturday..


We started to date, regular now, and at another date, when I went to get Melanie,
when the door opened to let me in, I could not believe my eyes.
Both Kim , and Melanie were standing there, wearing glasses.
They looked almost identical.
Melanie, asked me, well, which glasses wearing girl, do you want to take out to night?
I looked at both of them, and said to Melanie, you know, the type of lens, I prefer.
Sorry, Kim, you are wearing myopic lenses, so I will have take Melanie out tonight
Kim said, that s O.K.,I am waiting for my date now, you are not the only guy, who likes a glasses wearing girl..


                                                    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx




Melanie and I have been married now for about 6 years, and are the proud parents of two boys, Logan, and Matthew, and a girl Kelly.
We are very proud, of our family.
Melanie, and I are very health conscious, and know, hyperopia is a genetic defect. 
So eye exams, are done when recommended.
We both expect, our children, having to wear glasses, most likely in their early teens.
Our children, growing fast, and sure are a lot of fun.
They are very active, and like reading and computer games.
In the fall, Logan, is going into grade one, and Matthew into pre school.
So Melanie arranged for an eye exam, for the boys.
We did not expect, that both boys, would be prescribed glasses, at this early age, both are hyperopic, and have some astigmatism.
Both Logan and Matthew, feel very important now, wearing glasses, just like mom and dad..,
they look so cute, just like little men.
After the yearly eye exams, the boys, have had, only very small prescription increases.
Kelly, sure is different, she is now 9 years old, she reads very little, but prefers
dancing, gymnastics and sports, and she shows no signs of needing glasses.



A couple of years later, at the annual eye exam, as we had expected, the optometrist told us, Kelley, now, needed to wear glasses,
What we could not believe, is that she is myopic, no bigger looking eyes for Kelley, her dad will be disappointed.
Of course, she is a girl, SHE HAD TO BE DIFFERENT, and now, we will have to get used to looking, at smaller eyes, and I know, we will get used to that , and love her just the same.
