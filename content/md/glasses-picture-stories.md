GLASSES STILL LIFE

I'm still finding my way around this site, but I thought it would be a good idea to try to combine my love of glasses and photography together. They say a picture paints a thousand words, but I will try a few words along with the picture!

An occasion arose this morning which gave me the idea of trying a "Glasses Still Life". My wife went into the shower and left both of her pairs of glasses together on the bedside cabinet. This was unusual, as the first thing she always does on getting out of bed is to put on her main glasses - she has to. She must have still been half asleep this morning! However, I grabbed my camera and took this shot, just as they were. The ones in front are her full-time varifocals, L -6.50D, R -6.00D with a slight astigmatism correction and an add of +2.50D for reading. The red ones behind are her "reading in bed" glasses which are single vision lenses of about half the strength. She can't read any further than 2 or 3 inches from her nose without glasses. The reasons for getting the "reading in bed" ones were because firstly she often falls asleep with them on, and didn't want to bend or damage her main ones. Secondly, she likes to lie on her side reading, and this usually requires looking through the top of the lenses which is no good with varifocals. She can shower without glasses, but usually keeps her eyes shut. First thing that goes on after coming out of the shower before even getting dried is her glasses.

I just feel so lucky having a myopic wife. That's just one of the millions of things I love about her. I never tire of looking at her and admiring her in her glasses. I love to see the power rings (you can see 3 or 4 in the picture), and I love the way the lenses cut away the face profile. She, on the other hand, does not share my enthusiasm. She just thinks of glasses as a necessary evil. She once said "they're just an aid to help you see better!" I think so many glasses wearers think that way which is a shame, because instead of having a handicap, I think they are blessed with a rare gift. But now, with glasses being so much of a fashion statement, she is coming round to my way of thinking, and last time she needed a prescription change she got more fashionable frames. However, she chose a style with thicker temples and legs "to hide the ugly thick lenses" she said. Oh well!

Luckily, she has kept quite a few of her old glasses, and I want to try some photoshoots with them and relate the stories attached to them as there are quite a few. I also have a few old pairs of my own which are not as interesting as hers.
