My friend Hannah and me had a really nice evening and I had to give her an update of my vision journey. She said „Even though you have to wear an eyepatch again you suddenly seem more relaxed and happy than you were in the last years! Seems the bad eye had affected your personality! Maybe you should get yourself a stylish pirate style eyepatch and wear it as a fashion statement!“. I was surprised by her idea but stated that I were looking forward to my new glasses and I am not the right type of person for fashion statements.
But we enjoyed the time and had some fun till she brought me home later that evening.
7 days had gone and I couldn’t wait any longer so I called the optician shop to find out if my glasses were ready for pickup but they stated that the glasses were ready but prism foil would take another few days! So I had to be patient again. During that time I again tried to go with both eyes open but as I have got used to my good vision when using the patch I felt I could not go back to “normal”!

Still waiting for the optician to call - again at the wrong time - my ex classmate (Jonas) passed by, spotted me still with my patch and came in to ask me what was the matter. I first turned red, then explained everything and after saying good bye he added “when you will be pretty again we could go and have a coffee together to celebrate “! In that moment I hated that I still wore the patch!
Why couldn’t he pass by some days later???
BUT - hadn’t he just invited to have a coffee with him??? I just didn’t know what to think, weather to be unhappy about my awkward look or be happy about his invitation? At least he seemed a little interested in meeting with me!!

Finally, after 11 days the long awaited Prism foil had arrived and I went on to the optician to pick up my new glasses!
I have been so nervous that I forgot to remove the eyepatch before entering the shop!
I just recognized when I already was served by one of the handsome young opticians! - super awkward! - and he said “oh do you wear that eyepatch because of double vision? The reason why you need the prism foil on your glasses?” - “ahm yes…. ahm no…. …I don’t have double vision normally but blurry vision and I do get heavy headaches ….” - “ok so with the prisms you won’t need to patch any more?” - “ahm…yes I just needed a patch during waiting for the new glasses “ - “oh then I’m really sorry you had to wait longer than expected but now it’s over and you will look so much better with your new glasses, we have put the foil on already as prescribed”.
He fitted the frame in detail and- wow! - that was a very strange impression I had wearing these glasses!
Everything in the room immediately seemed to be 3D, the vision seemed slightly blurry and I saw some rainbow effects!
Like being on drugs!
Before I left the shop the optician gave me some more compliments, told me how good I looked in my new glasses, but I couldn’t pay attention, I had to concentrate not to run into anything!
Ok but Karolina had told me that it may take some time to get used to the Prism foil!
