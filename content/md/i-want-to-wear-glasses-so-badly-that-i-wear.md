I want to wear glasses so badly, that I wear ......


When you grow up in a glasses wearing family, you expect, you also should be wearing glasses.
My mother wears glasses to correct her myopia.
Dad is hyperopic, and I always admire his nice large eyes.
My older brother takes after my dad, and wears the same type of glasses.
At my last eye exam I was told my eyes are healthy and my vision is good.
I don t like the old doctor, why does he not tell me I need to wear glasses.

Kim has been my friend since grade one.
She wears glasses, she is hyperopic.
I have tried her glasses, but can t see much when wearing them.
I don t like the type of lens that magnifies, I like the other type like my mother wears.
My mother is aware of my desire to wear glasses.
She told me to be patient, that myopia runs in the family, and she is sure some day I will be wearing glasses.

Being a teenager, I read all the teen magazines and am very fashion conscious.
Because eyeglasses are now considered a fashion item, I think I like to get a pair of glasses with plain lenses, but I wonder if you are considered to be a fake.
When I talked to my mother, I told her I would like to get glasses with non prescriptive lenses.
She told me to go ahead, and thought it was a good idea, don t worry about what other people say.
You want to wear the glasses, wear them.

Kim who knew about my desire to wear glasses, went with me to the mall.
The selection of frames in the optical store is great.
We had great time trying many of the frames and looking at ourselves. 
I soon realized that the prices at the optical store were to expensive for my budget.
Kim suggested we try the store where they sell earrings and other fashion items.
I thought it was a good suggestion.
When we entered the store and looked around, soon noticed a good size display of fake glasses.
I tried some of the ones I liked best, and was sure glad Kim was with me.
Being a glasses wearer she had some good suggestions.
It did not take long to find a pair that I really liked and Kim thought looked fantastic.
I noticed that the glasses, because of a slight tint on the lenses, looked not to fake.
After I paid for them, proudly wore my new glasses.
When I came home, my parents thought I looked very nice.
My brother made a few nasty remarks, and I told him he was jealous because he did not look as nice as I did wearing glasses.
I wear my new fake glasses full time, I love wearing them.

A new school year has started.
Many more students are wearing glasses now, 
I received some compliments on my look, but also a few nasty remarks about me wearing fake glasses.
A few nasty remarks are not keeping me from wearing my glasses.

A couple of months later, Kevin a handsome glasses wearing guy asked me for a date.
We are going to the Mall Theater to watch a movie..
After the show we sat down at the food court for some refreshments.
Kevin asked me why I wore fake glasses.
So I told him my story of being the only one in a glasses wearing family, who does not wear glasses.
That I always wanted to wear glasses, but I don t need them, so I wear fake glasses.
Kevin then told me, how he to had always wanted to wear glasses.
You don t have to wear fake glasses, it s very easy to get prescription glasses.
About 2 years ago I realized that you can order glasses on the computer without a prescription.
I learned about lenses and studied the video on how to order glasses.
Then I went to the optical store and tried some different frames. 
I measured the width of the frames, the length of the arms, and ordered my glasses.
How strong are your lenses?
The first pair I ordered were -0.75. It did not take me very long to get used to wearing them.
Then I ordered the next pair that I am wearing now with -1.25 lenses.
I have a glasses fetish, I love wearing glasses, talking about glasses and 
looking at girls who wear glasses.
Kevin can I try your glasses?
After he handed me his glasses, I put them on,
I looked around and loved the feeling of looking through prescription lenses, but everything looked a little fuzzy.
Kevin do you know how strong the lens can be before you notice they are prescription?
I like to try what you did, but I am afraid my mother would notice if I wore prescription lenses, and she would not like that.
Well if you want to go out again with me, I will bring my first pair of glasses so you get some idea
what low prescription lenses look like when you wear them.
Now I could not wait for my next date.

On our next date we went to see another movie.
When we were seated, Kevin handed me is old glasses.
Wear them ,and you soon will find out how well you can see wearing them.
I put the glasses on, and realized I could see quite well when wearing them.
After the show I was still wearing Kevin s glasses, and was really surprised how well I could see.
I excused myself to go to the bathroom, so I could look in a mirror,
The glasses look good on me, but realized the prescription in the lenses is quite noticeable.
Kevin suggested I use the glasses as much as I can, and perhaps at your next eye exam you will be myopic and prescribed glasses.

The idea that wearing the glasses might make me myopic excited me.
I started to wear the glasses when in school, and soon could see perfect.
Now I have to be careful, to only wear the prescription glasses at school, and not to forget to wear my fake glasses when I go home.
I soon established a routine, wear the prescription glasses at school, and to make sure I put the prescription glasses in my bag with my books when I am ready to go home.
After a few weeks my vision wearing the prescription glasses is perfect.
I also noticed when I take the glasses off everything in the distance looks a little fuzzy.
When I mentioned it to Kevin, he said great, I think you soon are going to be a prescription glasses wearing girl.
When is your next eye exam?
My next exam is during the Christmas break.
That is only about 6 weeks. 
I am looking forward to find out if I will need to wear glasses, and hope I am not going to be disappointed.

I walked into the optical shop wearing my fake glasses, and wondering what I would be told after my exam. 
I was really surprised when I was told that the old optometrist, I did not like had retired.
When I walked into the examination room was greeted by a very pleasant glasses wearing 
female doctor.
Hello, I am Doctor Candy Jones, glad to meet you Ashley, please take a seat and we will get started.
When I got seated in the patients chair, she asked me for my glasses, to check the prescription.
You are wearing non prescription lenses, may I ask why.
 I felt very comfortable with Dr. Jones, so I told her my story of wanting to wear glasses.
She smiled and told me that she always wanted to wear glasses when she was young, and my wish came through when I was 12, and I still love wearing glasses.
My biggest surprise came when I had trouble reading the letters on the lower part of the Snellen chart,
At my last exam I was able to read almost to the bottom two lines.
When the exam was finished Dr. Jones told me that I could throw my fake glasses away.
Ashley you are myopic, you got your wish, you need to wear glasses. 
Here is your prescription, right eye -0.75, left eye -0.50 and a little astigmatism.
I thanked the Doctor, I was in seventh heaven, I will now be wearing prescription glasses.

When I wore my new glasses going home, my parents and even my brother told me how nice I look wearing the glasses.
I phoned Kevin and told him my good news.
He congratulated me, and told me he could not wait to see my new look
Next day at school, I heard some of the girls say, look she is wearing real glasses now.
Kevin smiled when he saw me, wow you look beautiful.
Your glasses sure look better than your fake ones.
Yes I know, but I am saving the fake ones.
The fake glasses gave me the enjoyment of wearing glasses.
