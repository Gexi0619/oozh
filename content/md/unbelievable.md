+I picked up an old pair of glasses with minus lenses.This was the first time I had a chance to really find out how fascinating they are.
Wearing them over top of my computer glasses I can see ,how everything looks a little further away, but very clear. unbelievable.

Tanya was a happy girl,
. She had so many things to be happy about.
She loved her parents, lived in a nice house , had a nice bedroom, was in good health, and an above average student.
Tanya s closest friend was Leslie, they have been friends for years, they both enjoy participating in school activities.
Tanya s present boyfriend is Ken, a tackle on the football team
Leslie is dating Logan the quarterback
The girls enjoy going to the games and cheering for their team.

The school football team made it to the finals, and the championship game was being played at the university stadium.
When the girls arrived at the stadium , there was a large crowd and the only seats available for the cheering section were
at the top seats in the grandstand, all their friends were there ,and they made themselves comfortable.
Tanya and Leslie were sitting beside their  classmates Carla and Amy.
When the game started, Carla pulled a pair of glasses out of her purse, put them on and said now I will be able to see everything nice and clear.

After watching the game for a while, Tanya mentioned to  the others that the field seemed so far away and blurry, and see could not see the numbers on the players shirts.
Amy who always wore glasses said , if you can t see everything on the field clear . you most likely need glasses.
Tanya said I never had any problem seeing the players and the field before, of course they never sat that far away.
Leslie said I have no trouble seeing the field and the players.
Now Tanya began to wonder . did she have a vision problem?
Carla how did you find out you you needed to wear glasses?
When I went for my drivers test , I was told to get my eyes examined., when I did I was told I should wear glasses.
I am myopic and have trouble seeing things in the distance., Now wearing glasses I can see everything far away just fine.
Tanya wondered how that could be possible., and hesitantly asked Carla , could I please try your glasses to see if they help my vision?
No problem, here try them, and gave Tanya her glasses.When Tanya put them on noticed a big improvement in her vision, she could see the players better, 
She handed the glasses back to Carla, thank you, I noticed a difference.
Now Tanya started to wonder how she would look wearing glasses. 
What would it be like wearing glasses?
What would Ken her boyfriend and other people say?

When she came home she told her mother what had happened at the football game.
Her mother was very surprised, and did not waste any time to make an appointment for an eye exam.

On the way to the eye exam Tanya was still very upset, she did not want to wear glasses, and still could not believe she had a vision problem.
After the exam had started , and the optometrist had checked the health of her eyes, which was excellent, the vision part started.
Tanya had trouble reading the letters on line 4 , and could not read line 5.
The optometrist after further checking , told Tanya she was myopic, had some astigmatism and needed to wear glasses.
Her prescription was -1.25 for the right and - 1.50 for the left eye, quite strong for a first prescription.
Tanya asked the optometrist are you sure ?
Yes I am, and I will show you,, now read this line.
I can t there are no letters.
Now I will show you the same line when wearing glasses.
I can read every letter , unbelievable.
After the exam and frame selection, Tanya and her mother went to the mall waiting for the glasses to be made.
While enjoying some refreshments, Tanya s mother trying to make her daughter feel better said, I think you are going to look great wearing glasses, it will give you a more mature and sophisticated look, I think you will like that.
Tanya smiled and said thank you, but was not so sure.

When they went to pick up Tanya s glasses, they were ready. When she put the glasses on and looked around noticed everything looked nice and clear,  a little  further away it seemed but clear and sharp, unbelievable.
When she looked in the mirror, she saw a very different young woman just like her mother had said.
She had to agree she liked her new look.
When driving home, Tanya could not believe the improvement in her vision, she could see so much better now.
She looked around wearing her glasses and then taking them off, the difference was unbelievable.
Tanya now realized she was fortunate having found out she had to wear glasses, her vision was perfect , and she liked her new look.
Now she wondered what it would be like wearing glasses in public, and at school for the first day.

To be continued.
