Nein, but what I can remember of my school  German lessons you like glasses like all of us, for myopia, 
Sometimes with your school English, if it is not perfect we might be able to help you
I almost think, you are asking for when wearing  high myopic glasses, what strength of contact lenses you need
Am I right?
