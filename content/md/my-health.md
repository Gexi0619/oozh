My Name is April I'm 25 years old, I was born in 1940 in the south of England, My father was a gamekeeper on a big estate I learnt to shoot when I was 10 years old, I was a crack shot, I could spot the birds before most of the others,when I was 15 I won the under 18s British clay pigeon championship, most of the other competitors were jealous of my sharp eyesight,

When I was 18 I started university,I loved all sports and had gained a sponsorship,
Even though I was quite attractive with blonde hair a bright blue eyes, I had never really had a boyfriend,I was not really bothered about that as sports was my main interest,I was still totally flat chested then,so that might have been something to do with the lack of interest from boys,I joined the athletic,club.Not have boobs flopping up and down was certainly an advantage in sprinting.

I think I enjoyed the sports more than the course work, between lectures I would be out on the sports field training then returning to my room late in the evening to do my studying.

After about 6 months I started to get lots of headaches, I made many visits to the matron for tablets for the pain,she suggested I go to the doctor, he then arrange for me to go for a eye test,
The eye doctor was not very friendly. He looked into my eyes and said they were very healthy then he told me to read the letters on the wall as far as I could, first the left eye then the right, I could read line 10 perfectly with either eye.
He informed me there was nothing wrong with my eyesight and he did not know why my own doctor had wasted his time sending me to him.

When I went home for Christmas my mother asked why I was taking so many paracetamol tablets
I told her I had a lot of studying to catch up with and was getting lots of headaches,so she suggested I try her reading glasses while I was studying.
I really didn't notice much difference, maybe the print was a little blacker,I tried
 to give them back to mum when the evening paper arrived,but she said she had a spare pair that she could manage with,and she said  I needed the glasses as I had not complained about headaches all day 
So to keep mum happy I wore them the entire holiday,even when we went out shopping.,
Mum even insisted I wear them for the New Years party, people were surprised to see me wearing glasses, but mum quickly said “Doesn't she look grownup now,I think glasses suit her ,she is studying to be a lawyer.

A week before I was due to return to university mum informed me that it was time for her annual eye exam and she had made an appointment for me.
I told her it was a waste of time because I had my eyes tested a few months ago, but you know what mums are like ha.

Mum still thinks I'm a child so I ended up wearing her reading glasses when We went to the eye doctor and had she had to come in with me and tell the doctor all the things that I could have told him, and that I had to wear her reading glasses constantly for the whole holiday 
He was a much nicer man than the other I had seen at university.
When I read all the way to the last line I thought so that's it let's go now.But then he put those funny glasses on and put a black lens In Front of my right eye,next gave me a card to hold and read some lines from it, I managed 2 lines but the rest were blurry, he put a lens in front then I read the next two line then another lens and all was clear,
Then he changed the black lens to the other eye.I was shocked. I could not  read any of those lines.he kept putting many different lenses in.
After that I was told to read the big chart on the wall again.This time I could only manage line 8 with my right eye and big shock only line 6 with my left eye, but I thought that's ok I will only be wearing them for reading and the print on the card had been very clear.

Then came the shock.,”I don't know who tested your eyes young lady but you should be wearing glasses,you are long sighted in your right eye plus 5 but I am a little concerned about the health of your left eye and it is extremely long sighted you need a correction of plus12 also you have a small amount of astigmation in that eye” 
“At first the distance won't look very clear,It will take your eyes a week or so to get used to wearing them.
After that time you will be legal to drive again.

I smiled “It's ok doctor I can't drive and I will only be wearing them for studying ha “
“I'm sorry Miss but you missed what I meant you will NEED to wear glasses all the time now and I want to see you again in 3 months”.
“If you give this prescription to assistant she will take some measurement for your glasses”
His assistant asked if I was ok, “Do you want new frames or shall we fit your new lens into your existing frames”
She looked shocked when I told her that the glasses I had on when I came in were my mother's reading glasses that I had borrowed’. This would be my first pair of glasses.
“O you poor girl how have you managed,This is a very high prescription for a first pair of glasses”
“The doctor has written for full time wearing and next time check left eye in more detail”
“It will take you some time to get used to them”

“You are a student so the Government  will provide you with free NHS glasses and lens,you have a choice of pink or blue frames”

I was still in shock.why do I need to wear glasses all the time, I just said pink.

“I have marked it urgent for you”

4 Days later my mother excitedly woke me at 9 30 your glasses are in,get ready father can drop us off he has to go into town”

What was all the fuss about.”Hurry up April your father is waiting.

The lady was pleased to see us,”I expect you are excited,we got them ready for you so fast but,the doctor rang them and said it was urgent.

Why would I be pleased I did not need glasses I could see perfectly I only got head aches when I was tired 

I was just about to thank her,when she opened the case,there before my eyes were the pink NHS glasses,just like the pairs 2 of the girls at school used to put on secretly when nobody was looking and hurriedly put them back in the cases before the boys could call them 4 eyes.
But worse was to come,the right lens looked ok but the left lens bulged out in the middle, even more than my boobs I'm still completely flat chested I don't even Have 2 little bumps yet.
I didn't remember the 2 girls having metal hooks to go around your ears,the lady told me they were called temple cables and the doctor thought they would stay on me better when I was running.
Did he really think I was going to be seen on the sports field wearing them.

Mum said “ let me look darling”
“You look so sweet Alice,it's just a shame the left lens is so different,but I'm sure we will get used to seeing you wearing them”

The lady gave me a card to read,I had to admit it was very clear and easy to read,it's seemed strange walking around in them everything in the distance looked fuzzy,the lady explained they my eyes would adjust in about 2 weeks , she then took them off to polish the lens,I picked up the cart to compare it without the glasses on,it was a real struggle to read any of it,I was sure I could have read that before.

Every morning my mother brought me in a cup of tea,she placed it on the bedside table and picked up the glasses.”Here dear let me put them one for you remember what the doctor said”

After a week it was time to get ready to go back to university, even though things in the distance looked clear now,I was looking forward to not having those glasses on,yes they would be useful for studying but as soon as I got around the corner they were coming off and straight into their case were they BELONGED.

As soon as I was out of sight I stopped, got the case out and said GOODBYE glasses, see you another day. It did feel strange without them.Mum had made sure I wore them every waking hour of the day since I got them. The glass lenses were rather heavy, especially the thick left lens, I rubbed the top of my nose to make sure there was no red mark there.

I got to the station I went to get my rail pass out but everything looked blurred my handbag, I thumbled for my wallet with my pass and bank cards in.
If I found it there was no possibility I could tell which was my train pass.
I felt around in my bag and found the glasses case. I had to put my luggage down. I needed 2 hands to hook the glasses cables over my ears.found the rail pass,check the date on it ,put it in my pocket and placed the glasses back in their home.
Got to the platform, did I have time for a coffee,needed to check the train times,on the board on the wall, I can't read any of that small print. So out came my glasses, managed to get them hooked over my ears this time.
If I'm fast I can get a coffee no time to put the glasses back in the case so kept them on. Got my coffee and found my seat on the train,it was good I had kept the glasses on or I would not have seen the seat numbers.

As the train started to move a young lady said “Is that seat next to you number 97.im as blind as a bat but my boyfriend hates girls wearing glasses so I have been in a total fog for 3 weeks haha ”

“Do you remember me we went to the same school I was one of the girls that used to put her glasses on when nobody was looking ha, but now my eyesight is so bad I need them as soon as I wake, I recognised  your voice weren't you the girl that one all the cups at shooting

Yes that was me, I remember now there were 2 of you that hid your glasses.

She screwed her eyes up and squinted at me. How long have you had to wear glasses you used to have such good eyesight?

“They are only meant for reading. These are my first pair. I got them last week. I only needed them to see the time table and had to rush for the train so I kept them on”

I felt rather hot
I quickly took them off, as I was about to put them back In their case.

“Wait while I put mine on I want to see what yours are like”

She took a case out of her bag.

And put her glasses on.

I closed my left eye,”They are  very nice” I said

 I really couldn't really see them but was not going to admit that.

“l Still wear the same pink NHS glasses that I used to hide at school,but now they are thick coke bottles, so I never wear them when I'm with boyfriend,he hates girls that wear glasses,he would die if he saw the thickness of these lens”

I couldn't  really see them.

“Now stop being shy April put your glasses on you know you need them”
“Wow your eyesight must be very bad your left lens is so THICK that's cool”
“And they pink NHS like mine,That's ace ,make sure you keep them on now”

That was the last day I ever went without my glasses on,it was easier to wear them than have to explain it all like this.

I went home for Easter
“Mum insisted I went back to the eye doctor

I had to admit to the doctor that I now needed to wear the glasses for everything including sport.I showed him a picture of me wearing my reading glasses on the podium after finishing first in the 100 metres national final.

He spent an even longer time checking my eyes, especially the left eye.with the test frame on and and some different lens in it I could now read line 8 with both eyes,I walked around the store and even stepped outside with the test frames on
“Will this be my new prescription in my reading glasses doctor”
He smiled at me.”It's time you stopped calling them your reading glasses April they are what you need  wear all the time.so I suggest you call them my everyday glasses or normal glasses, I haven't checked your reading yet”

He took the test frames off of me handed my glasses back and told me to put them on and read the lines on the small card
“Why have you given me a different card this time I can't read any of the lines “

He gave me that knowing type of smile again.”It's the same card April”
Then he took my pink NHS glasses off and placed the test frames back on
me.
“Now try,Is this better or worse”
“Better, better  better um about the same, about the same but blacker”

He then gave me the verdict.
“Your pink frames look a bit bent now I expect you have fallen asleep wearing them so I suggest we make you another pink pair with the prescription that you looked outside with, for normal wear .and this prescription in a blue frame for reading. 

I looked stunned “What do you mean doctor,you said I should call them my everyday glasses”
I got that knowing smile again “Sorry if I did not explain it very well you now need 2 pairs of glasses, one pair to wear for normal activities and a different wear for reading and studying in. 

“You mean I going to have to change glasses to read,like grandma does”

“Have you noticed any other problem on your left side,I shook my head.
“That good but if you do let me or your GP know, this is your new prescription give it to the lady in the other room and she will sort you out”
“Bye see you in the summer holidays”

The lady looked at the piece of paper and explained what it all ment.
Right eye plus 8 astigmation 2
Left eye plus 18 astigmation  6
ADD 4  

A week later we were back collecting my glasses.
First the pink pair, the frames were a little brighter colour this time but still the NHS type and they still had the hooks to fit around my ears to hold them on I could certainty see further with them on and things looked very sharp. The lady had to adjust them as the weight and thickness of the left lens made them crooked on my face.
She gave me a small card to read,I had to say that  I couldn't read any of it.
She then opened the other case.
“Try these dear,they should help”
She handed me a pair of very small round metal framed glasses in a blue with those hooks on again.
“They need to be a smaller frame dear the left lens is now plus 22 with a lot of astigmatism correction they are glass lens so they are rather heavy”

I could read all the lines perfectly but could not see anything else, the lady gave me a hand mirror,look dear they fit you very well, I could feel the weight of the lens pullin on the hooks at the back of my ears.
I gasped because the left lens just bulged out of the tiny frames,why couldn't  my boobs look like that, even with the cotton wool stuffed in my bra they were still flatter than that lens.

Mum gave me a lot of support
“Well dear at least you won't have to wear your reading glasses in public the pink ones look bad enough” thanks mum.

I Was more prepared for the train this time,put the dreadful reading glasses on  looked at the time table and WROTE THE TRAIN TIMES on a large piece of paper and put my New normal glasses back on, the extra thickness of the lens sparkled and just SHOUTED OUT LOOK IM NEW 
I arrived at the station early got a coffee and found my seat on the train,
The train was just about to leave,I heard a voice say “Is that you April, I hoped you be in the same seat,has my boyfriend gone he said he would wave at the window”
 “Yes he's gone”
Phew I want to try my new glasses I only picked them up just a few minutes before my boyfriend meet me at the coffee shop,he still doesn't know I wear glasses he thinks it's cool that I always holding his hand and when we are in the Cinema he is too busy kissing and trying to touch me to notice I can't see the film haha 

She opened the case
Why was I worrying about my new glasses when two blocks of ice were staring at me.
“My eyesight has got a lot worse now the doctor said the lens would be thicker this time that's why he fitted the hooks on the end of the arms,they are still NHS frames but I choose blue this time”
“Will you help me put them on, they feel very heavy, mum couldn't  afford the new plastic lens so they are still the glass type the hooks are strange, I know yours have them as well”

I noticed her fingers feeling the thickness of the lens as she handed me the glasses, she screwed her eyes up trying to look at the glasses.
As I hooked them over her ears “O that's such a relief to see again the last to weeks have been hell”
“OOOOO MYYYY  You have new glasses as well”
“What has happened to your left eye it looks Hugh”

Before I had time to answer the ticket collector arrived,luckily we both still had our ticket in our pockets.
“I'm sorry lady's this train has been diverted today did you not read the notice at the gate? You have to get off at the next station and change trains.I will write the platform details and times down for you, you will have 2 hours wait”

The guard gave us the paper with all the details on.” I hope you don't mind me saying but I notice you both have new glasses and they look very nice. Have you ever thought of getting a disabled rain card? I can see from your lens that you both have very poor vision.please don't be offended.

I was just about to reply when the train started to slow down.

“You must both get off here I will help you with your luggage, hope to see you another day”
We sat down to eat our fish and chips, I looked towards the paper the guard had given us, there was no possibility that I could read it with these glasses on,I
did not want my secret that out now,that I now needed a separate pair of glasses to see to read, as I looked up Jenny was staring at the piece of paper, she pushed it towards,you know more about trains and platforms she said, I smiled back and pushed back to her and said he gave it to you ,
We looked at each other and started to giggle,

Jenny opened her bag and held up a glasses case.”Did you get a pair of these today hahahahaha 
My secret was about to come out, I put my hand in my bag and pulled out a matching case.

We both put our new reading glasses on.

 
A week before the summer brake was due to start ,I was in the middle of a lecture classes, I started to feel faint, lights were flashing in front of my left eye the tutor voice started fading and my arm felt heavy I went to stand up to leave the room but my left leg gave away and I crashed to the floor.

When I woke my parents were standing beside the bed,I tried to speak but my voice was all slurred and I couldn't get the words out,I started to cry.
My mother tried to comfort me,and explained that I had a small stroke but I. Should make a good recovery.
What did good mean, why not a full recovery.

It's good to be out of hospital and  back home now, I have got my strength back in my left arm and leg, when I fell I broke my everyday glasses so I have had to manage with my old pair.

My mother made an appointment for me to see the eye doctor my mother told the eye Doctor all about my stroke.
“The  prescription for my right eye was very nearly the same as in my broken pair, but the stroke had badly affected my left eye, it was difficult to keep it straight as he change the lens in the test frame.eventually he said that was the best he could do for now and I should come back again in 3 months, I left his office clutching that piece of paper again.

The lady said it was nice to see me and was sorry to hear about my stroke,she then explained my new prescription 
Right eye plus 9.25 astigmatism 3.75
Left eye plus 29.25  astigmatism 7.25 prism 20 out 
Reading ADD 8 prism out 30 
They would be ready  in about a week.
She then ordered a taxi to take me and mum to the hospital for my check up.

The stroke specialist was very pleased with my progress , but warned me that another stroke could be fatal. I told him I was waiting for new glasses as the stroke had affected my eyesight quite badly
He then made a phone call and arrange for his assistant to take me along to the audiologist depart he wanted to check all parts of my health 

I had to sit in this small booth wearing a big head phone and tell the nurse when I could hear a beep seemed very easy.

After 15 minutes the nurse said to wait and the doctor would come and talk to me about the results.
What was there to talk about I pressed the button each time I heard the bleep.

The doctor came in and the nurse was carrying a box thing.

“Good morning miss I understand you are doing very well after your stroke”

“Yes thank you doctor”

“Just turn your head this way please,while I fit this into your left ear”

“What is it, Why are you talking much louder now Doctor”

“it's your hearing aid April”

“Why do I want that thing? only old people wear those things,my Grandmother wears one and it is always whistling,I pressed the bleeper each time I head the noise”

“Yes April,but  the problem is many times you didn't hear the bleeps”

“I have to get permission for a second aid,the nurse will show you how it's fitted then I will come back and see you.

What did he say about me getting a second hearing aid, why do I need a spare hearing aid do they break easy.
“It's very easy to use miss, these are the batteries that fit in the box and this is called the button this part pushes into your ear so you just see the white button and ,this  BLACK cord attaches to this box, you can fit around your waist or what a lot of ladies do is put it inside their bra,if you put it in the left cup you could put more cotton wool in the right cup”

How did she know I had 2 little bumps and cotton wool in my bra instead of proper boobs.

The doctor came back in.
“That's was easy Miss, Things will sound a little different at first”

My mother came in then,she just stared at my ear.

 “Your daughter needs hearing aids now the stroke has badly affected her hearing this will help her to hear much better also her balance will be better,I will see her next week to see how she is getting on with it,Make sure she puts it in as soon as she wakes that way it's easier to get used to wearing a hearing aid”

I was in a dazz as I walked out, wearing that white button thing in my left ear and the box making the left bra cup sticking out more than my right cup with just my nipples not it.why was my heart beating so loudly.

In her own way Mum was actually quite encouraging.
“Never mind dear granny wears one,it's better than the trumpet thing she used to have”
She bought me a new 34 C bra and sewed a pocket in the left cup and put some padded around it for comfort and sewed a false foam boob into the right cup, it did give me more confidence not looking flat chested.

Glasses are ready,I'm going on my own to collect them today.

Same frames as before but left lens even thicker so not very happy,also very heavy.
The hearing aid button fell out as the lady fitted the glasses hooks over my ears .

As soon as she pushed it back into my ear the loud whistling stopped.

“I'm sorry April I did not realise you needed to wear a hearing aid now,I knew the doctor had sent you to the auduglist for a check up,but I thought that was just routine, but looking back we did have to repeat some things last time you were here.”

 The hooks that I hated before are very useful now they stop the glasses slipping  down.
I really can't be seen outside with these new grotesque reading glasses, I expect you all can imagine what they look like., but I can see ok and I'm lucky to be alive.

The next week I went back to the audiologist on my own for my checkup. 

The nurse greeted me with a smile”I have GOOD news for you April,the doctor has got permission for a 2nd hearing aid for you,sit down and I will fit it for you”

What was good about that,why did I need a spare hearing aid and I knew how to fit it.

“WHAT are you doing nurse it's my LEFT ear that I wear the hearing aid in”

“Did you not understand what the Doctor meant when he said he got permission for a second hearing aid for you? 
“This is for your right ear”

I was in total shock.Needing to wear one of those things in my ear was bad enough If they thought I was going to wear 2 of these things they were mistaken, Thank goodness Mum had not come with me,I'm not going to tell anybody and as soon I got out of there it was coming straight out of my ear.

Even though the new term has started a month ago I wanted to go back to uni to discuss how I could continue my studies.

Mum took me to the station, my left leg was aching,I had not done much walking since my stroke,maybe it had affected more than I had said.
Mum had insisted on going back to the car to get the walking stick the hospital had given me, I tried to tell mum that I didn't need it, but it was only a token objection,deep down I knew I needed it.
.
We were sitting down drinking coffee and eating the burgers that she had got on the way back from fetching my walking stick when a voice called out “Good morning miss,It's good to see you how are you feeling now,I saw your friend on the train last month she said you were not well.

“Yes thank you I feeling a lot better, I'm just going up to university today to see if I can get any extra help with my studies”

I turned to Mum , “This is the guard on the train that we catch up to uni, he helped Judy and I with our luggage last time when we had to change trains.

“That was so kind of you, I'm so worried about her traveling on her own,it's the first time she has been out on her own since she had her stroke”

“O Mum did you need teIl everybody I had a stroke”

“It's ok miss don't get upset, nothing to be ashamed about”

“Can you make sure she gets off a the correct station,as you can see my daughters eyesight is very bad now,also she's has just got a HEARING AID and is not used to wearing it”

O MUM Stop it, why do you have to  keep telling people I'm DEAF as well as half blind I can Manage please Go home now”

“But you have not got your ticket yet”

“It's ok madam I will make sure she gets her ticket”

“Thank you that's so kind of you, She will need to put her NEW  reading glasses on the sign the check, make sure she doesn't lose her walking stick”

“GO MUM GO NOW”

“Don't get upset miss,she's only worried about you”
 “My name is Peter, Are you in a rush to get the next train, If we we go on the one after, I'm the guard on that so I could help you I finish my shift at Newcastle”

“Yes please that would be very kind of you Peter, my name is April”
“Now you know I'm half blind and  deaf in one ear and need a walking stick,do you think I should get a disabled railcard like you suggest last time on the train”

“I think you should get it to save yourself money haha, and as a guard on the train I would know when you were traveling,so I could look out for you”

I went bright red ”You could always ask for my phone number,that would be easier haha”

“We have 3 hours to wait for the train,Would you be afenaffend if I sugested we went to the park and had a Ice Cream and coffee,I could put you luggage in the locker, it's a 25 mins walk but I could borrow one of the railways wheelchairs

“That would be lovely,but don't you mind being seen with a girl in a wheelchair ”

“That's a silly thing to say, you are still the same pretty girl I first saw when you got on the wrong train”

Was Peter making a pass at me,I have never been called pretty before,Is it my 2 fake boobs,what would he think if he knew one side was all foam and the other had this plastic box in so I could hear,and that I fact I was really flat chested.
If mum had suggested I sit in a wheelchair I would have been angry,but when Peter suggested it I just said yes.THAT'S STRANGE

10 minutes later Peter returned pushing a wheelchair,”You look very smart,why have you changed”

It was Peter's turn to go red this time.

“I did not want you to think I was a porter pushing a lady to catch her next train”

We sat down beside the lake eating and chatting and laughing,it was something I had not done since my stroke,I had forgotten how to laugh. 
Peter handed me an envelope and a piece of paper
What was I going to do? How could I say thank you.
If I opened it I would not be able to read it.
If I put those horrible reading glasses on that would be the end of having any chance of getting to know Peter better.
He had seemed to accept I needed these glasses but those reading glasses are even worse.

Peter smiled,”Aren't you going to open it.?O wait here's your handbag”

I went red again and just stared at the bag he handed me.

“Come on a please put you new reading glasses on your mum said you have some now”

He said I have some reading glasses now not that I NEED reading glasses now he is such a kind man.

My hands were shaking as I opened the case,at least as soon I took these glasses off I wouldn't be able to see the horrified look on his when I put the reading glasses on.
Trying  to get those stupid hooks over my ears was difficult especially with that hearing aid in my left ear.
I caught the cable hook on the the cord of my hearing aid the white hearing button came out of my ear,and the cord tangled around my glasses, I panicked,once the hearing aid came out of my ear it started whistling loudly and my glasses dropped to the floor, how could I stop that whistling without putting may hand into my bra.I started crying.
The whistling stopped, I could feel Peters warm hands touch my face as he pushed the white button of my hearing aid back into my ear, then I felt the heavy weight on my nose and the hooks on my reading glasses being put behind my ears 

He just said “will you open the envelope please” No comment about my ugly reading glasses or the hearing aid button that he had to put back in my ear or even what was in that box sticking out of my bra.

I opened the envelope and there were 2 first class tickets to Newcastle.

“I have changed my shifts I thought I would travel to Newcastle with you if that's ok”

I  looked up and smiled  completely forgetting I still had Those dreadful reading glasses on.”yes that would be lovely, but what about the cost”

It's ok I get some travel vouchers so mine is free and the other is for a beautiful young lady that needs cheering up”

“That's so kind of you,Yes I do need cheering up but I'm not beautiful,Just look at me,what do you see, I need 2 pairs thick glasses glasses to see only old people need reading glasses I have just been told I must wear this hearing aid,and these are false, I'm Flat chested these thick lens are bigger than my boobs sob sob sob

Peter lifted me out of the wheel chair and sat me on his lap and hugged and hugged me till I stopped crying
“I have a spare room would you like to come back to my apartment and travel up to university tomorrow”

“Yessss please, I needed to get away from mum that's why I decided to go back to university ”

Peter pushed me back to the station,collected my luggage,and ordered a taxi,he had a lovely top floor apartment.he carried me into the spare bedroom.peter said good night and closed the door

I had a lovely sleep, I think I heard a knock on the door,but without my hearing Aid in I wasn't sure,so I shouted “Come in I could see the blurry outlines of Peter standing there.

“Good morning April breakfast is ready”

I sat up,The room came into focus as I felt my glasses being hooked over my ears,as Peter had put my normal glasses on for me.

“Did you sleep well,It's a beautiful morning April I have made breakfast I thought we could have it on the terrace”
“I will wait in the kitchen for you when you are ready,”
He lent across to the bedside table.”You have left your hearing aid on overnight I will take it into the kitchen and put new batteries in it for you”

I looked into the bathroom mirror, what must he have though my makeup had all run from crying yesterday,I had just fallen straight to sleep last night, I looked further down, I remembered taking my blouse off, but had forgotten about my bra, the left cup had collapsed when I had taken the hearing aid box out, so I had just one 34C cup boob the other was flat”
I put my blouse back on and shyly went into the kitchen. Peter was all smiles when he saw me. He came over to me,It felt so nice,him putting the White hearing aid button back into my ear and Turning it on.He did not seem to mind doing it.
He handed me the hearing aid box.
“You had better put your other boob back in April” He said with a loving smile on his face 
“My sister has 2”

I stared at him”what fasle boobs”

Haha”No hearing aids”

We both burst into fits of laughter 

“This is a beautiful apartment you have Peter,Have you had it long”

“I bought it about 2 years ago 

“Do you need to go to uni today,or could you stay another day and we could go out for the day together”

“Oo That would be lovely.the main reason I was going up to Newcastle was to get away from mother,I'm not used to living at home,to be honest, but I don't know if I can cope at university now, but if I don't try I won't know” 

We had a lovely cooked breakfast on the terrace,It was so easy to talk to Peter,he made me feel so relaxed,I did wonder how he could afford to buy such a beautiful apartment on a rail guards wages,but now was not the time to ask.

After a lot of descustion we decide we would go to Kew gardens for the day,

“Would you like to shower now and I can go to the station to borrow a wheelchair for the day”

I thought for a moment,I really like Peter. Do I tell him the truth about my stroke?

“Peter before you go Ito get the wheelchair I think I should tell you more about my health”

“My stroke was worse than I have told mum.You have been such a kind Gentleman and not asked any question,

“It's fine you don't need to explain anything April”

“Thank you Peter, but I think I need to”

“I Used to have perfect vision I won lots of clay pigeon shooting competitions,but suddenly I started getting headaches and having problems reading so I had to get reading glasses every 3 months the prescription go stronger”
“Then 6 months ago I had a stroke. Now I have to wear these dreadful glasses all the time and those even stronger glasses for reading,my next appointment is next week so I might get even worse glasses,as you know I'm very deaf in my left ear, but I'm supposed to wear a second hearing aid in my right ear,but nobody knows that especially mum, I really can't be seen wearing 2 hearing aids”
“I have problems walking,I am meant to wear a  leg brace”

I'm so scared I might have a second stroke”

Peter just looked at me,”OK thanks for telling me,maybe if you wore your leg braces instead of using the wheelchair then we could hold hands”

I did not know what to say,I must have looked stupid,just sitting there with my mouth open.
“You mean you don't mind”

“Nope,why should I”

“Are you going to have a shower then we can go out for the day”

The bathroom was beautiful,I wish we had more time, the bath looks lovely and I wouldI have love to relax in it.
Should have brought my reading glasses in with me can't see to do my makeup.
What should I do I can't walk very far,I said no to the wheelchair and I never even worn my leg brace.

“Coffee is ready April are you ready”

“Peter can we talk while we drink our coffee I'm worried and scared”
“I really want to go to Kew Gardens but I don't know if I can manage the walk”

“Don't worry I will go and get the wheelchair if you don't want to wear your leg brace”

“It's not that I don't want to wear it.but I have never put it on myself and won't you be embarrassed being seen with a disabled girl”
“Why waste your time on me “

“What a silly thing to say,here are your reading glasses, go back in the bathroom put your makeup on while I get your leg brace out of your case and I will workout how it fits “

30 minutes later  I had my makeup on and Peter had fitted my leg brace,

Peter said ”I found you other hearing aid in the case as well hold still while I put it in for you”

If my mother had said that I would have been angry, but Peter has such a kind voice and uses nice words 

“What are you doing Peter”

“Well I can't put iyour hearing aid box your bra you have all that padding there so I thought it better to wear it around your waist”

“But people will see it”

He gave me a big smile “yes so what's the problem,you look beautiful ,come on let's go the taxi is waiting and the meter is ticking haha”

What has happened to my world he just said I look beautiful.

I'm walking around Kew Gardens wearing my thick NHS glasses with the hooks over my ears to stop the weight of the bulging lens making them slip down and 2 hearing aid buttons in my ears, the  black cords are plugged into the boxes so I can hear.one box is in my bra where my boobs should be and the other strapped around my waist for everybody to see.
My left leg has this heavy black NHS brace on it and I'm using a walking stick,
BUT I'M HAPPY

Peter squeezes my hand.
“Do you really want to go back to University at Newcastle or would you like to come and stay with me,then study at home,I would be able to travel with you when you had work to hand in”
“The spare room is free, we could push your bed to the side a little,then I think there is enough space to put a desk and computer”

When We got back to the apartment,I was very tired after walking around,so Peter suggested I go and have a lie down while he set up the barbec

It was a beautiful evening sitting on the balcony.Peter said he had some things we must talk about.

I felt ill. Did he have a wife and 4 children,had he changed his mind and did I have to leave tomorrow.
I must have looked scared because Peter came over and gave me a big hug 

“There is nothing to worry about April dear,I expect you wonder how I can afford this apartment on a guards Salary, 

I nodded 

“I only work on the railway because I love trains and meeting people, when my father died I inherited the family estate in Durham.my younger sister looks after the house and my mother there,that's why I get off of the train at Newcastle”

“I don't think you remember me,we first meet when you were only 16 years old

“I'm sorry I don't remember,how could we have meet”

“Your father was a game keeper, he once visited our estate,with his employer for our annual game shoot,and he brought you with him,and later that day I saw you on the clay pig in range,I fell in love with you then.
“I recognised you again the first time I checked your ticket on the train”

I started crying “But I'm not that same girl, look at me now”

“Inside you are the same girl dear and you looked so happy yesterday”

The next day we decided to go to the university to see if I could arrange to study from Peter's apartment, I had never traveled first class before, we had a wonderful meal and a bottle of sparkling wine,I even wore my reading glasses,it was easier to see to eat with them on.
Peter got up and knelt beside me and gave me a little red box,when I opened it there was a beautiful ring inside “Will you marry me April”
Before I had time to answer the train stopped,Peter grabbed my arm.

“Come on darling this is were we are getting off”

I was still in shock from Peter asking me to marry him that I haven't even taken mreading glasses off so everything was a blur,I could not even see the station name.
Peter handed me my distance glasses,I gasp as I read the station name.

GRETNA GREEN

 Was that a yes Peter asked.

An hour later I discovered that Peter was in fact Lord Peter and I was now Lady April.

Peter had arranged for his chauffeur to pick us up,but it had been a long drive to his estate,and all the family were already asleep,

Our bedroom looked beautiful,there were flowers everywhere.

Peter took his shirt off,he slowly removed the hearing aid button from my right ear,and unstrapped the box from my waists and handed it to me

“Will you fit Your hearing aid in for me,you choose which ear I wear it in and strap the box around my waist, I want to be like you,on our first night together”

My hands were shaking,next he took my glasses off and told me to hold them I felt the weight of my reading glasses on my nose and the hooks over my ears then  he took the other hearing aid box out of my bra I Felt my nipples tingling and getting hard as his warm hand touched them.
He pointed to my distance glasses that I still had in my hand  and lifted my hand towards his face.
The addrilin was pumping through my body as I hooked them over his ears.

Xxxxxxxxxxx 

 Next morning when I woke Peter was still lying there with just my hearing aid in and my glasses on.

Later that morning I meet Peters mother and sister they made me feel very welcome,
Peter's sister wore rather strong minus glasses and 2 hearing aids like mine.

The next day we set off for London it was time for my check ups and to face my mother she though I was still at university and had no idea I was now Lady April 

The Doctors receptionist was pleased to see me looking so happy and was shocked when I gave her my new married details and Address.

My eye examination went very well. The doctor increased my right eye prescription by plus 1.25 and my left eye by an extra 3.25 making that eye plus 32.50 the reading Add increased to 10 
Peter asked the doctor if he could make me a special pair of binocular glasses so I could see to shoot again as we would be living on his estate

“Yes that's possible April I remember you won lots of cups for clay pigeon shooting before you had your stroke,which eye did you use for shooting”

“That's the problem doctor it was my left eye,it used to be my best eye as well but now my worst eye”

“That's not a problem”
“We can fit a blacked out lens for your right eye,so you won't need to close that eye when you shoot and for your left eye.We will fit a Franklin bifocal lens, the bottom section will have your new distance prescription in Plus 32.50 astigmation 7.25 and prism out 10 and 5 up and the top third of the lens will just have your astigmation and Prism correction and a small binocular fitted to it.
So to walk around you lift you head a little and look though the bottom of the lens to shoot you lower your head and line up the binocular lens with the eye socket on your rifle”

“Wow that sounds great doctor,you really think I can shot again,but won't I look stupid wearing that”

Peter interrupted.”Remember you are Lady April now and my wife everybody will be so pleased to see me happy and you shooting again. 

Peter liked the frames I was wearing so we just ordered the same again. And for the shooting glasses the round NHS frames with the temple hooks on but in tortoiseshell colour.

I was shocked when Peter asked for his eyesight to be tested,I thought he had perfect vision.

The test showed Peter had nearly perfect eyesight but as Peter told the eye doctor he wanted to wear glasses as well he was given a prescription of 0,25 for each eye.
Peter then whispered something to the doctor,I tried turning my hearing aid up,but I had forgotten they were already on full volume.

Peter just said he had thanked the Doctor,I was not sure if I believed him ha.


Next we went to the audiogest departments, Peter watched while I was in the little glass booth,the Doctor said my hearing had deteriorated, so the nurse fitted 2 new white buttons into each ear and connected the new larger  more powerful hearing aid boxes. Peter asked if I could keep the old aids as spare Incase the new ones broke, he smiled and said we better buy a bigger size bra now.

Peter had not minded that I was still flat chested,he seemed to like making my nipples get hard and swell up. I don't know why I'm still totally flat chested but my nipples are hard and stick out nearly 2 inches all the time since Peter started playing with them 

Time now to go to the orthopedic appointment this I was not looking forward to.

“Good morning April,How are you managing,I see you are wearing your leg brace today,I remember you refused to keep it on the day we fitted it”

“Yes this is my husband,he suggested I wear it all the time”

“That is very good,I am pleased you found such a sensible man.

“Yes I was lucky to meet him, I have just had my eyes tested and I'm getting some special glasses so I can see to shoot again.

“That's very good April, did you tell him what I suggested last time you were here”

I went bright red and started to stutter.

“Sorry I can't remember it doctor. it was hard to hear then I had only just got hearing aids and only had one then.

Both Peter and the Doctor looked at me,I could see in their eyes they did not believe me.

“Ok Doctor if my wife did not hear you,I think you should tell us again she has new hearing aids today”




“Well, the stroke left her left side very weak,so I suggested she wore an arm brace for her left arm.

Peter looked at me.”That sounds a good idea darling if you are going to start shooting the rifle is rather heavy,I'm sure it would help.

Ok I thought to myself but shut up now doctor.i can cope with that but not the other
Peter was still looking at me.

“Was that everything that April didn't hear,Doctor”

I could feel myself getting redder.

“Well actually I wanted to fit an extension bar on the end of the leg brace  so her foot didn't touch the ground,it would help her weak ankle, but she did not want that as it meant she had to wear a built up orthopedic boot on the right foot.

Peter looked at me “It's good you got your new hearing aids dear and I came with you dear or we not know about that”

What was good news about that I already knew but the thought of that was just too much for me.

“Yes Peter, but I expect it will take a long time to get,so maybe next time we come they could order it”

The miserable looking nurse piped up,”It's ok we ordered them last time you were here we can fit them now for you,won't that be good”

Thanks a lot I muttered to myself.

The nurse seemed to enjoy fitted the bar onto my leg brace,my foot was now about 4 ins off the ground and all my weight was supported on the leg brace then she  started fitting the orthopedic boot on my right foot it was black and the sole was  about 4 ins thick as well and attached to it was a leg brace that was strapped to my leg finishing just below my right knee.

Peter could see I was upset so he suggested he take the arm brace home and he would fitt it himself when I was not so stressed.
“Look darling you have grown 4 inches you are nearly as tall as me”
Peter is so kind he always makes me laugh and looks on the bright side of things.

When we got back to our apartment there was a beautiful smell of cooking coming from the kitchen. Peter had arrange for a private chef to cook us a special meal to cheer me up
It was a wonderful meal Peter handed me a glass of Brady. This was not the life I was used to.
“To us and our future” Peter said.
Peter picked up a small Wooden box,”I have never asked you April do you smoke”

I was rather inbrased, No I'm sorry I have never tried a cigarette”

“ Hahaha I meant cigars,Now is a good time to learn after a nice glass of brandy”
Peter showed me how to prepare a cigar and he lit it for me,I can remember it being placed in my mouth and the warmt taste in my mouth and the lovely aroma,but I think the wine and the brandy mixed with the cigar must have gone to my head. 
The next morning Peter woke me,I still had my glasses on and both hearing aids in but both boxes were on the bed laying beside my empty bra,as I went to take the cup of tea my arm felt heavy, I looked at it and to my suprise Peter must have fitted the arm brace on it last night.

It took me a week to learn to walk with the brace and orthopedic boot but now I'm used to it my leg and ankle no longer hurt, we are going to get my new glasses today and go and see my mother.
Peter suggested I wear the glasses with the binocular lens straight away and if there was a problem with it we could go back while we were in London.

I loved the look of Peter wearing his glasses with the same tortoiseshell frames as mine,
My mother was shocked when she first saw me and nearly died when I said I was now lady April  

That night was wonderful I discovered what Peter had been talking to my eye Doctor about and why he had suggested I keep the old hearing aids 
I was relaxing in the chair when Peter walked in. He ONLY had my old hearing aids in and the thickest minus lens I had ever seen.( He explained that the eye Doctor had used oversized blanks and not had them thinned) He carried me into bed. He made me feel so sexy as I lay there with my just  glasses, hearing aids and leg and arm braces on.i never knew making love could be so beautiful.
As We both layed there  Peter light 2 cigars I felt light headed and as if I was in another world I loved the taste of the cigar as I sucked on it.  



Time has flown by and I have been able to see to shoot again and the arm brace which I now wear all the time helps with the weight of the rifle. At first It was strange wearing the Franklin bifocal lens with the binocular lens fitted, but I now I love them and wear them constantly instead oh my distance glasses, only changing to put my reading glasses on,next time we go to my eye Doctor I want a pair like them but with a binocular lens fitted to the right lens as well.
I'm now a regular cigar smoker. Most days I have 2 or 3 and at night we lay on the carpet together with just our glasses and hearing aids on and of course my leg braces, which are now attached with bolts so they stay on permanently we love drinking brandy and smoking a large Winsten cigar I have still have never smoked a cigarette.
When we are out shooting I can always be spotted by the trail of smoke as I puff on my churchwarden pipe hanging from the corner of my mouth.and my tobacco pouch close by. 
I am 8 months pregnant now and have to wear both hearing aid boxes strapped to my waist as there is no room in my 38DD bra for them, my breasts are so heavy with milk now ha
