Julian Tuwim (Poet from Poland) into English:

Where on earth is Mr. Hille yelling, Where, oh where, is my glasses dwelling?

He searches in his trousers and in his shoes, In every nook and cranny, his patience he'll lose.

He rummages through every drawer and chest, His coat, his robe, with much unrest.

A scandal, can you believe, Someone took my glasses, oh, what a thieve!

He vents his anger at the sofa and chairs, In frustration, he pulls at his hairs.

Neither in the piano nor by the hearth, In the mouse hole, his glasses, nowhere on earth.
 Someone call the police, it's a time of dearth!

Suddenly, he glances at the little mirror, And there he spots them, clearer and clearer:
Like a rabbit, The glasses perch on his nose with a habit.

Mr. Hille exclaims with joyous might, There it is, my glasses, what a sight!

He puts them on, a smile on his face, Suddenly, everything appears in its rightful place.

The world reveals a brand-new light, So sharp, so clear, a wondrous sight.

Letters on pages leap and dance, The flowers in the garden, colors enhance.

Mr. Hille is glad to have his glasses returned, For without them, the beauty would go unlearned.

The glasses are faithful companions indeed, Opening his eyes wider with every deed.

Now he walks through life with a clearer view, 
Thanks to the glasses that help him through.
