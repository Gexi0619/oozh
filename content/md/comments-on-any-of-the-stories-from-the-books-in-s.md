A compliment from Bobby, as well as a compliment from lorelai.grace82 has gotten me to realize that some people genuinely want to comment on one of the stories in the e Books.
I realize that I specifically asked for no comments. This was for 2 reasons. The first, and main reason was that a comment on a story there can take the eBook  out of the sequence of the book and they are numbered sequentially. My second reason was that these stories were all written back before Bobby stopped posting any new stories on his website and comments would not do anything to help me become a better writer. And, while people might not think that comments help. the quite often do give a writer a better insight as the the direction to take.

Comments are ego building and are  very nice to receive, so if anyone wants to comment on the eBook stories I would love to have you post them here. 
Thanks and enjoy reading the stories. I only have another 15 to go in the eBook series
