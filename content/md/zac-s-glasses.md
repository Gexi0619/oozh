In 2009 9 year old Zac starting telling his hard working single Mom he thought he needed glasses. His Mom thought he was trying to be like 2 of his friends who had recently got glasses and didn't believe him. Zac's break came when the his school had their annual vision screening. His teacher called his Mom and told her yes your Son needs glasses. Zac's Mom still thought he was faking. The nurse said no he's not. She went on to explain the school now has a local eye Doctors office bring in an Auto Refractor. The nurse explains 2 reasons for this. One is kids faking they can't see. The other reason is kids that can't see the letters memorizing the letters that the kids with good eyes can see. Zac's Mom takes him to the eye Doctor and he prescribed glasses with a power of -.75 R and -.50 L. Zac is told to wear the glasses only for school and possibly going to movies and sporting events. Zac is told he can take them off to read if that is more comfortable. Zack goes thru the usual prescription change wearing the glasses as prescribed. By 2014 now 14 years old and his prescription is up to -2.00 and 2.25. Zac questions the Dr. on why not wear them all the time. The Dr. who wears thick glasses says the only patients he suggests full time wear for is the ones who can't function without them. Zac's Mom not knowing a lot about glasses as she has always had good vision agrees with the Dr. Zac decides to research the matter online and when asks the question how much to wear glasses with his prescription most of the answers say all the time. Zac showed his results to his Mom and she says go ahead and wear them like you want to but don't tell your Dr. When Zac turned 15 and went to a new eye Dr. because his old one had retired his prescription was now -2.50 and -2.75. Zac's new Dr. said you should be wearing them all the time. When told what the old Dr. said the new one said despite studies to the contrary he strongly believed that wearing glasses too much made myopia worse. Zac did try contacts once in high school but didn't like all the care required and went back to glasses. Zac got his driver's license restricted to glasses which was no problem because he wore them from the time he got up until he went to bed. Zac finished high school and went to work. Not only did Zac go to work but he took night classes at the local college and looks like he will graduate in 5 years for a better job. Zac still happily wears his glasses all the time. When asked by another student if he would consider Lasik when he's older Zac said "no my glasses are part of who I am".
