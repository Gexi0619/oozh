I am trying to find out all the information i can get about wearing glasses for myopia.I have been trying to write some stories, but I want to be correct , even if they are fantasy stories.
Nobody in my family wore glasses, my grandparents wore lorgnettes and I had one  uncle who wore glasses.
My first experience with glasses was when my niece got glasses. I used to spend quite a bit of time at their place, and when we played she always let me wear her glasses and I liked that, [now I figured out she had + lenses] I had no trouble seeing when wearing them.
So that is how I started to like glasses, but I did not need them, but sure wished I did.
At school very few kids wore glasses, I remember in grade 5 there were 2 out of 29 who wore glasses and I always envied them.
In my teens I noticed that some  lenses [ now I know they are for myopia] looked far more interesting.

What I would like to know because of my lack of experience,  what it feels like to wear myopic lenses.
I have tried some and find them very different from my + lenses.
Is it true that when you have an increase in your prescription  is it exciting when you try them on for the first time?
I look at a lot of myopic lens wearers and like to see the rings and the clarity of the eyes.
I would like some information from your experience, and would appreciate your story.

I know I am a nut case about glasses [ my wife says so] but I feel it is harmless. I love to go to an optical store and look at and handle frames, try them on . I love to watch other people try frames and see what they look like.
When I see a glass case I like to see what is in them, and even try the glasses if I get a chance.
I have been wearing glasses for more than 50 years and still like wearing them.
Looking forward to some interesting replies [so I have  more knowledge for future stories]
Thank you Nic.
