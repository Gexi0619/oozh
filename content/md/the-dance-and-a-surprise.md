Kelley, Ann and Kathy had been friends since grade one. They lived in the same area . not far from the Mall . school, the arena and sports fields .
Kelley a red head with some freckles and always had a big smile.
Ann was a petite blonde with blue eyes, a very sweet type of girl.
Kathy was a well built girl with ash blonde hair and beautiful brown eyes, she was a bit of a tom- boy, very athletic and full of fun.
All three girls enjoyed playing sports, they were members of the tennis club, played baseball , and in the winter enjoyed skating at the arena.   
During the summer holidays, after their second year at high school, when playing tennis, Kathy who had always been the best player, realized she lost more games lately and was not happy about it.  She was very competitive and liked to win.. Her batting , while playing baseball was not as good as before and it bothered her.
When she discussed it with her parents, they told her that they were sure the other players were getting better, and some of the baseball pitchers were getting more experienced and getting better. They told her just enjoy the games , you cannot win them all.

There was going to be a teen dance at the arena, Kelley, Ann and Kathy were all excited, they would meet all their friends from school again and have a good time.
At the night of the dance, the girls all dressed prim and proper, went to the arena.
It did not take them long  to find their friends  and there was lots to talk about.
After the music had started, Brandon a class mate of Kathy asked her for a dance.  She liked Brandon, he was a pleasant guy , a good student and liked and played sports. They danced well together and had a great time.
When they ran out of things to talk about, Kathy asked  Brandon , if anything really exciting had happened to him during the holidays.   Brandon smiled  and said yes, but it is really not very exciting, I have to wear glasses now.
Kathy looked at him and said well I don t see them, where are they?
They are in my pocket , I feel I look like a dork wearing them, so I only wear them when need to.
Kathy told him , I don t believe  you could look bad wearing glasses  Why don t you let me have a look . Let us sit down and you can show me your new glasses, I like to see what you look like wearing them.
When they sat down , Brandon pulled out a glass case , opened it up , took out his glasses and put them on.
Kathy looked at him, and said what are you worrying about, you look fantastic wearing glasses, I like them very much, they make you look smart and very handsome, all the girls are going to love your new look.
Brandon told her the reason he had to get glasses was he failed the sight test , when he went to get his drivers licence.
So he had his eyes examined at Jones Optical, and he was told he was myopic. And when Dr Jim suggested he should wear glasses was not very happy about it. After the Doctor had shown how much better he would be able to see wearing glasses, realized he needed them.
Now when I wear my glasses I can see everything so much better. Before when I looked at the EXIT sign over the door it looked like a red dot , and now when I wear my glasses can read the print.
When I wore my glasses at last weeks ball game , my batting was much better, I had no trouble seeing the ball coming and had some big hits.
Kathy was all ears when he told her that. She told Brandon that lately she had trouble hitting the ball , it always seems the ball comes out of nowhere.
Do you think I might have a vision problem and need glass?  Brando said it is possible, you seem to have the same problem I had seeing the ball coming out of nowhere, I don t have that problem now.
Would you like to try my glasses?  It might give you some idea how different everything looks , and if they help improve your vision.
Kathy said , yes I would like to see what things look like wearing glasses. I have never tried anybody s glasses and have no idea what to expect.  Brandon then handed Kathy his glasses, she carefully put the glasses on , and slowly looked around,and said I cannot believe it , everything looks more clear and sharp. I cannot remember seeing things this well, it is unbelievable. 
I can see what you mean about the EXIT sign I can see and read it now. I never realized glasses could improve your vision like this.
I think I need glasses. Brandon said to Kathy , looking at you wearing my glasses, I think you will look terrific when you get your own with a nice frame  made for a women.
After  that , they danced some more. Brandon confident after Kathy s compliments was wearing his glasses now, quite a few fellow students noticed and told Brandon how good he looked, he was pleased.
A little later Kathy asked Brandon if she could try his glasses again, she told him she would like to find out what it feels like wearing glasses when moving around.
Brandon handed her the glasses, she put them on and was surprised how easy it was to wear glasses, how well she could see and how comfortable they were to wear.While dancing Kelley and Ann noticed that Kathy was wearing glasses and wondered where they came from.
After a couple of dances Kathy gave Brandon back his glasses and thanked him for letting her try them.
Brandon said I am sure that the next time I will see you , you will be wearing your own glasses. Kathy said I am sure you will.
On the way home from the dance , Ann and Kelley asked about the glasses. Kathy told them about Brandon  and his new glasses , and she tried them , and thinks she now needs glasses.
When Kathy came home she told her parents about Brandon and his glasses, and what had happened when she tried them.
Her parents agreed she should have an eye exam, to find out if she needed glasses, and would make an appointment for her.
Kathy and her mother went to Jones Optical for her eye exam.  Kathy was very impressed with the procedure. When the exam was finished Dr, Jim showed her how the letters on the chart looked like before and how they will look when wearing glasses. She could not believe it. Now she wanted glasses to be able to see that well.
Kathy s mother with the assistance of Marsha , the optician, helped her select a nice tortoise shell frame that looked great on her.
When they went back to pick up the glasses Kathy was excited, after the proper adjustments, and when looking around was very happy with the improvement in her eyesight and pleased with how good she looked wearing glasses.
After she came home she went to see Kelly and Ann. Both girls agreed that the glasses looked very nice and of course had to try them.
Kelley could not see much with them, did not like them and gave them back to Kathy. When Ann tried the glasses she noticed everything looked a little brighter, but the glasses hurt her eyes a little and when she took them off said I think I could see everything a little better, do you think I might need glasses.
Kathy suggested that perhaps she should have an eye exam and find out.
Kathy told the girls she never realized her eyesight was not perfect when she tried Brandon s glasses, and how well she could see wearing them. Ann said she was going to talk to her parents.
About a week later when the girls got together again, Ann was wearing glasses. She looked very nice wearing them, they were not as strong as Kathy s, but she was happy how well she could see and liked the looks and feel of them. Kelley could not get over how nice Ann looked wearing glasses and told her she felt like hugging her she looked so nice. Ann smiled and told Kelley that wearing glasses made her feel good, and did not mind having to wear glasses.
When the new school year started , both Kathy and Ann were now wearing their glasses full time ,and happy to have them.
They received many compliments on their new looks, and noticed that quite a few more students were wearing glasses now..
Brandon came over to Kathy to tell her how nice her glasses looked , he knew she would look fantastic when she tried his glasses.
He was wearing his glasses full time now, after she had told him how good he looked wearing glasses.
He told Kathy that wearing his glasses had made him feel more confident and now was comfortable wearing them.
Kathy thanked Brandon for asking her to dance with him, and letting her try his glasses, and discovering that her eyesight was not as good as she had thought it was.
It just shows , you never know what can happen when you go to a dance, The biggest surprise is when you find out you cannot see as well as you thought, and a week later are wearing glasses, seeing everything properly , and liking the looks and feel of them and be happy to be wearing glasses.
