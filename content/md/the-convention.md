The Convention


Being a regular visitor to Vision and Spex, I could not believe, my eyes, when I saw the message from Val, that all the Vision and Spex members are invited to a convention like meeting in Niagara Falls.
That would be fantastic, to meet all those members, who all, have the eyeglasses fetish bug.
The explanation is, that one of our members, who is also very rich, is going to look after all the expenses.
All you have to do is Email his secretary, and she will look after all your travel arrangements and costs.
She will be the only one to know your name and details, and she will send you, your ticket to fly to either Toronto, Canada, or Buffalo N.Y., and you will be picked up to go to Niagara Falls.
Only your, Pen name will be used at the convention, so exciting!


Since I have never had a chance to try GOC, I sure wanted to go.
I love to talk to all the people, who do GOC regularly, I love to experience it myself. 
My wife knows, I like the looks of glasses, but I don’t think she knows, I have a glasses fetish.
So, since there is a horticulture school in Niagara Falls, and I like gardening, I told her I was going to a two day horticultural conference.


Because, I live only about 150, k.m. from the falls, I will be driving there, it is a pleasant drive,
past peach and plum and pear orchards, and lots of grapevines, to supply all the wineries, and where some of the grapes are left on the vine, to freeze, and make the famous ice wine.


When, I reached the hotel in Niagara Falls, parked the car and went in.
It was easy to find my way to the area where we were having the convention, the just look at the picture of a nice glasses wearing girl, showing her hand, holding a pair of glasses pointing where to go.
Just before I reached the room, where the convention will be I passed a row of 4 desks
At the first desk, was a beautiful, red headed glasses wearing girl, 
Hi I am Sandy, what is you pen name?
When I told her who I was, she gave me my name tag, and told me to go the the next desk.
A gorgeous , blond glasses wearing girl said Hi, I am Katie, when she looked at my name tag, 
said Nic, here is the key to your room, enjoy your stay.
At the next desk, a real good looking glasses wearing brunette, smiled at me, hi I am Ashley, 
here is a copy of the program, of meetings and entertainment.
At the last desk, an African/American, glasses wearing girl, told me with a big smile, welcome to the Falls, here are your tickets for all the activities and excursions in the area.


Since I was an early arrival, and after seeing those beautiful girls, I slowly found the way to my room.
Like everything else , a very nice room, and wandering over to the window, realized I was able to see both the Canadian, and American falls, a fantastic view.
When I noticed the little bar, there was a sign on it, this is a no charge bar.
How lucky we are to get such a beautiful paid vacation.


While in my room, I started to read the program for the meeting.
4 o’clock , Cocktails and finger food.
6 o’clock Dinner, and a welcoming address by Val.
8 o’clock a Miss Spectacle wearing contest.
10 o’clock dance and social hour, with a note, that all the girls in the Miss spectacle competition, would be available as dancing partners.
Well I better get ready for a busy afternoon and night.


Cocktail hour, had just started when I got there .
A pretty, glasses wearing girl, offered me some finger foods.
While wandering around, read some of the name tags, GOC guy, Lurkin, Zalkalwee, and next I spotted 
Spex for ever, wearing the highest prescription myopic lenses, I had ever seen, just like the ones in his stories.
I tapped him on the shoulder, and introduced myself, a guy looking way out of place, wearing his +2.50
street glasses.
He told me to meet him later so we could have a good talk.
Just wandering around was fun, I met Carrie and her glasses wearing girlfriend, I met Puffin, Brillenstein,and Soundmanpt, but best of all, there was Zennia, who in the past, when I first started to write stories, always made some nice encouraging comments.
What fun, to be able to talk with all those members, and looking at all the strong lenses in their glasses.
Before I knew it , we were asked to find our seats for dinner.


When seated for dinner, Aatthe head table, sat ,believe it or not Bobby, Val, and Spexforever.
Val welcomed all the members, and thanked our sponsor, which created a very loud applause .
Next we were served a delicious dinner served by glasses wearing waitresses.
We all relaxed, while watching the Miss Spectacle contest, sponsored by the local optical stores.
I noticed Crystal Vale having a wonderful time taking pictures, and everybody had a great time.
It sure was a pleasure to look at all those glasses wearing girls
And after a few dances, I was ready for bed.


The following morning, there was an opportunity to do GOC.
Local opticians would fit you with contact lenses, depending on how myopic or hyperopic you wanted
to be, and Cactus Jack wold assist you in getting the correct combination.
I don’t know where all the glasses came from, but there was a pair waiting for you in the prescription that you wanted.
What an opportunity, to try something I had always wanted, to experience being myopic.
I loved it , and what made me really happy, that I could keep the contact lenses and glasses, so I wore them like everybody else, I knew I would not get much of a chance to do it, at home.
When we were having lunch, and looking at all the medium, and high prescription glasses, sure was a sight.


During the afternoon sightseeing trips, it was hilarious, when people got their glasses wet from the spray of the falls, and when they cleaned their glasses, but had trouble seeing wearing the strong prescription contact lenses.
After all the sightseeing, everyone of the members were sure glad to have had such a good time.


At the cocktail hour, I met some more of our members, Weirdeyes, Spex for me, GOCguy and many more, 
After the Dinner , Val thanked us all for coming and making our meeting so enjoyable, and of course our sponsor, who had made all the arrangements.
Then, I received a poke in the ribs, and when I woke up, my wife asked me ,why are you so happy, all you do is smile.
Well would you not smile after a dream like that?
