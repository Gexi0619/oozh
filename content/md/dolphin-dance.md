Dolphin Dance
-------------------

I was on holiday last year in California, during which one day I went to a sealife centre to watch the dolphins: I really like dolphins, they're so clever and fun, and seem to really enjoy their carefree existence. Upon joining the queue at the gate, I discovered they had guided tours and shows about every two hours, so I paid, then waited with about a couple of dozen other tourists for someone to take us round the centre and show us the dolphins. At the appointed time, a young woman came out of a side door. My eyes nearly fell out of my skull at the sight of her: she was about 25 years old, 5'4, or maybe less, well built without being fat, shapely and curvy with large breasts that pressed hard against her yellow blouse, and she wore an above-knee blue skirt that revealed that she possessed quite decent legs too. Her name was Amanda; I knew that because it was printed on her namebadge. 

She had shoulder-length dark brown hair that she kept in a bundle behind her head, and quite a chubby face. And glasses: what glasses they were too! Smallish sort of rounded-squarish, gold coloured, and her lenses were soooo thick: at least 1/3 inch, heading for half an inch maybe, pressing against her cheeks and face beautifully, with lovely plano fronts. And how strong? In terms of Coke Bottles, about a crateful. They must have been oh, at least minus 25? To be honest I wasn't counting. She took in our straggling group of dolphin-lovers, apparently not noticing my interest. She turned her head this way and that; the light from a window played across her flat-fronted lenses, causing my knees to wobble like jelly.

Eventually the appointed time came, thus she came up to us and introduced herself. She seemed quite a confident person, with a strong, clear voice and happy, smiley personality. She led us down some steps, during which I noticed how carefully she walked down them. She started showing us some of the exhibits: it wasn't really a museum, because the real exhibits were swimming around outside, but it was still interesting. More so than I’d initially thought, because someone at the back held up a tourist guide book, and asked,
'this says you feed them in the evenings.'
Before Amanda could respond, her eyes narrowed behind her thick lenses: I knew that when someone needs lenses like hers, it's a bit hard to see what the eyes are doing: it often happens that a wearer of such
glasses doesn’t get perfect vision either, which was exactly the case for Amanda. She asked hopefully,
'is that a guide book?'
'Yes, it is.'
'Well, it’s right, but if you are disappointed because you’re missing the feeding, don't be because the dolphins do a lot more than just eat!' 

Amanda then guided us outside to the pool, around which were some plastic seats. Amanda stood at the front; I made sure I got a seat at the front not a million miles away from her. Of course, I wasn't so interested in dolphins as I had been about two hours ago when I’d set out for this place. The show lasted about an hour, with the dolphins doing all the things dolphins do best, such as cavorting about in the water, jumping through hoops and having fish thrown to them. At one point in the show a dolphin landed in the water near enough to shower Amanda; she turned to face us, with a few drops gleaming on the front of her thick lenses and some on her blouse, thus making her bra even more obvious than before. She wiped her lenses with her fingers, smiled at me, and said 
'that's better, I can see now.' 
I gave a smile back, too charmed by her looks to do more than breathe a gentle sigh as she turned away.  

Far too soon the show was over, and Amanda was saying goodbye to us at the exit. My heart melted when her lovely bespectacled gaze settled on me for a brief skipped heartbeat. She smiled and said,
'bye now, have a nice day.'
I left with a heavy heart: I know there are plenty of GWG's out there, but I treasure every “close encounter” I have with one as if it’s my last. And Amanda was certainly one to remember. I didn’t think I’d ever see her again. How wrong I was. 

A couple of days later I went to a beach, swam around a bit, then found a secluded cove not more than twenty yards across in the cliffs. I spent some time sunning myself on the golden sands before going into an interesting-looking cave: it turned out to be not as deep nor interesting as I’d thought, so I turned around and looked out. Suddenly I realised I was not alone! I saw something, no someone swimming underwater.
It didn't seem a very big someone, either. I shrank back, hoping whoever it was would go away and leave me to enjoy the peace alone. This they did not: instead, a head appeared above the water, wearing a diving mask and snorkel. I recognised the face immediately. It was Amanda! My heart and brain raced as I watched her walk up out of the water, dressed in a dark one-piece swimsuit. I'm not sure whether it did more for her than she did for it, but she looked utterly stunning in her voluptuousness.  

I could see that her diving mask was adapted: quite obviously prescription, but she only glanced at the cave mouth where I was peeking around, thus I guessed that it gave her even less vision than her glasses. I watched her reach down to small case on her belt and open it. In it, I could see her glasses glittering in the sunlight. She then pulled off her diving mask, shook her wet hair around, then put her glasses on. I remained in the cave, watching, waiting and wondering what to do. Unfortunately my nose chose that moment to sneeze! She immediately looked in my direction, squinted a little, then said,
'hello?'
She started walking slowly toward my hiding place, asking,
'hello, is someone there?'

The game was up: either she walked right up to the cave and found me hiding inside, or else I went out before that and got seen anyway. I decided to step outside and let her see me, whereupon she recognised me instantly, gave a hesitant sort of smile, then asked,
'So, what brings you here?'
I stuttered out,
'I... I... was hoping  for a little, errr... solitude.'
'Oh. Do you like being alone?'
'Not usually.'

I wasn't making much sense: I don't know if it was the swimsuit, the breasts or the glasses, or something of all of those, so I just gazed longingly into her eyes. Her voice snapped me out of my little trance,
'why were you hiding in there?'
'I wasn't hiding, I was... looking.'
'So what's in there?'
'Just some pretty rocks. Not that great really.'
“Ah, shit,” I thought, “she must think I'm a creep.” She walked past me to have a look. I followed her and watched her standing at the entrance, looking in. She said,
'I can't see anything,'
then shrugged, adding,
'but I don't see well in the dark anyway.'
In an innocent, pretending-to-not-know-anything-about-glasses voice, I asked,
'really? Why?'
She turned to me and said,
'yeah, real bummer. I'm a high myope, if you hadn't noticed the glasses. My eyesight isn't that great even with them, but it's as good as it gets. What they LOOK like, well I guess I and the rest of the world just has to live with that.'
For once she didn’t seem quite so smiley. I coughed and said,
'Hey, why don't we go swimming?'
If it may be thought that this was a ploy to get a look at her squinting around while changing from glasses to diving mask, this supposition would be entirely correct!

She agreed, took off her glasses and carefully put them away, then glanced at me and asked,
'you still there?'
'Yeah'
Her eyes squinted excruciatingly, but it didn't seem to do her much good. She gave up and put her diving mask on: I could see that these seemed thicker, being as they had to be tougher than glasses... wow, what coke bottles she had. She told me,
'I can't see that far in these. Underwater, it doesn't matter much,  but they're not really practical above water.'
I shrugged and started for the sea.

Well, we spent a good half an hour bobbing around in the water, often swimming underwater. I'm pretty good underwater; unlike Amanda, I used ordinary swim goggles, the gods only knowing what would have happened if we’d swapped! After a while she swam underwater after me, and I felt something warm and soft run across my back... I think it was her, and I think it was her bust... I came up very abruptly and coughed badly: it was a bit of a surprise, but a very nice surprise. She surfaced nearby, then swam toward me with a huge smile on her face. She called out to me,
'hey, did you like that?'
I could hardly say no. She swam right up to me and reached out to hug me: a heartbeat later we were hugging each other, kissing and I was gently feeling her breasts... 

Of course, we couldn't stay out in the sea doing that, we'd sink as soon as we got tired. Reluctantly we parted and swam for shore: this time it wasn't the hidden cove that we headed for, but the place where I’d swum from to find it. Once ashore, Amanda changed back to her glasses. I asked,
'Amanda, do you want dinner tonight?'
Her eyes widened in surprise. She answered,
'Why, yes, that would be good. Thank you.'
I couldn’t begin measure the smile on her face.

We went to my hire car, got in and started off back to my hotel where I was staying, first promising to take her home. She said to me, in her usual upfront, far-from-coy tone,
'do you find me attractive?'
'Yes, of course. Otherwise I wouldn't have felt your breasts.'
She laughed at that, then said,
'do you like the way I look... apart from the breasts?'
“Like” was a real understatement... I stuttered a bit, then replied
'I like your face... you look so pretty.'
She pointed at her glasses, looking and sounding sceptical as she asked,
'with these?'
'They are part of the attraction.'
Her face mirrored her surprise, then she said,
'you're serious, aren't you?'
'Yeah. Quite so.'
'You English are weird. But I guess I like weird...'

She sat for a while, thinking. Then she asked,
'what's it like to drive there? Different from here?'
'Yes, it is... Apart from being on the wrong side of the road... but I'm used to that now.'
'I'd like to drive, but I can't see well enough.'
'Really?'
'Yes! Didn't you see me straining my eyes back there? My visual acuity is something like 20/80, or pretty shit in  practical terms. I need to see 20/40 to get a driver's license here. What's it like in your country?'
'Oh, about the same, I think.'

She shrugged, and said rather sadly
'I find it so hard to do things everyone else takes for granted. Like driving, or finding a job. You know, I had to really struggle to get that job at the Dolphin Center?'
Then she looked at me, and said,
'and boyfriends? What are they?'
I’d never heard her sound so bitter: maybe the friendly, outgoing personality was just an act, or maybe just sometimes the pain leaked out unexpectedly. Then she smiled, as if realising things were not as bad as she thought. She said more brightly,
'so, I now know you are a weird English guy who likes fat bespectacled girls... I know someone like that!'
She pointed at herself, and laughed again, tossing her hair around in delight. I dropped off at her home and promised to be back for my date. 

When  I got back to my hotel, I flopped down on my bed on my back and stared at the ceiling: I think the only thing I said was “wow,” over and over. That was an amazing experience! And hopefully, tonight, if my luck was in, just maybe...

It was a long time before I realised it was time to get ready, so I was obliged to do just that in a real hurry. It was all running through my mind as I ran around like a headless chicken getting dressed up: images of her, busty and bespectacled... wow, wow, wow. Then I went outside to my car. Time to go and meet the real thing!

By the time I pulled up outside Amanda's home, it was getting slightly dark. I got out and saw her door open, and as I walked toward the door, Amanda appeared in the doorway... my jaw dropped inside my head, and nearly did the same for real. Her hair fell around her head softly, her glasses shimmered as she looked at me. She wore quite a long dress, really, white and far from opaque...  especially where her large breasts pressed hard against it, revealing a slice of each. She said, in her usual forthright manner,
'I thought you liked my breasts.'
I nodded numbly. I vaguely noticed that she wore high heels and lipstick as she gently cuddled up to me as we walked back together to my car. Once inside, she asked,
'where we going?'
'Oh... I found somewhere.'
Actually, I'd picked it at random from a short list the hotel receptionist had given me!

It was about a fifteen-minute drive to the restaurant, by which time the light in the sky was rapidly fading. We parked down a side street, and she waited for me with her arm out and a certain look on her face. She reminded me
'I can't see so well in this light... you'll have to guide me.'
I took her arm, and felt her big soft right breast press into my side like a warm beachball: we walked to the place I'd chosen, and went in. We sat in a sort of cosy corner, the sort of place I liked and she wasn't worried about. She did say to me, holding out the menu,
'I can't read this very well... it's too dark in here.'
'Shall we move outside?'
'No. I like it in here. Kinda makes me feel all...  helpless...'
As she looked at me through her thick lenses, I wasn't sure she was aware what part of her I was looking at most, but I had the most awful dilemma... I am a breast man and a speccy fan too! To get both at once is great, but what does one look at? I wished I had a spare set of eyes!

I had to stop myself staring too much while we were eating, but at one point Amanda guessed what was going on. She said
'I can't really tell what you're looking at, but I think you like what you see, am I right?'
'That's right. A thing of beauty indeed.'
She smiled graciously, and replied,
'thank you. No-one has ever said that to me before.'
We finished the meal: the food was OK, but the feast for my eyes was much, much better!
While I paid the bill, she asked me, with artfully feigned coyness,
'what do you want to do now?'
'Oh, I don't know.'
I lied, I knew full well what I wanted to do!

She helped me out by saying,
'you could come to my place...'
She smiled, and then added
'I feel kinda frisky!'
'OK, we'll do that.'
'Thanks for dinner. It was... Good.'
We went outside, and again she took my arm.
'Please don't let me trip... I look kinda bad when I fall over...'
'Don't worry. I'll look out for you.'
I led Amanda back to the car. She smiled her thanks at me and we drove back to her apartment.  

We arrived back at her apartment, where Amanda seemed to gaze at me longingly; although I couldn't see her eyes that well behind her glasses, and I doubt she could see me that well either. But the truth soon  came out when she asked me to sit on the couch, then sat beside me. Within moments, she was was all over me, hugging and kissing me, mouthing,  
'darling! Darling, I love you!'
I thought, “wow,” as I felt her huge bust with my hands... She gazed at me through her glasses, and said,
'sorry, I can't do romantic, I can't see very well in the dark.'
'You can feel, though.'
'Yep, I can feel your hands.'
What followed I can barely begin to describe: “we made love” does nothing to convey how it really felt, but it was explosive and just like the first time for me. 

Of course, it was time for me to travel homewards far too soon. She was so upset, but I promised to come back. By that time I had her phone number and she had mine, and we'd swapped addresses. She waved goodbye to me at the airport, and that was that. And what happened next? She's coming to visit me next week. I have pictures of her all over the place, I'm mad about her, which would not surprise even the most casual observer upon seeing us together. Hopefully we'll work out some way in which we can swim together forever.
