It was about 2 pm Friday afternoon Vanessa and I had been out for lunch.
As I walked into the shop my receptionist,said” Jill is in your office she has come back a day early and wants to see you”.
“Hello Jill how are you,l did not expect to see you tomorrow, did you have nice holiday”
“Yes thank you”.
“But I have a problem sir”
“Was your mother angry about your new glasses and you wearing hearing aids now.you had better tell all about it”
“Mum was pleased to see me,and surprised that I was wearing glasses and hearing aids now,but when I told her all about why I was wearing them ,and how I was helping you,she was very proud of me”.
“I never told you that I have a younger sister,she is going to be starting at this school after the summer,so the next day Mother got my old school uniforms out and told me to help Jacky try them on to see,if any fitted her”.
“We went to my bedroom with them and we found some that just a little big but I thought that she would grow into them,she looked at the school photo I had put on the dressing table”
“Will I be wearing blue glasses like that when I start, they look cool,is that them in the case”
“She ran over picked up the case put the glasses on,Mum Mum look at me,can we go to town and show Dad at lunch time”
“She has worn them all the time since,she says she can see much better and everything looks bigger with them on and she loves the feel of the thick arms over her ears,I never told her they were hearing aids as well as glasses”
“Yesterday mum let her wear them to her friends house,and later in the day her friends mum rang to say they were going away for the weekend could Jacky go with them so mother agreed,she forgot Jacky  was still wearing my school glasses”.
“Mother has given me money to buy a new pair for this term then I will bring the other back next term”.
“Can you make them with this new prescription please,I have got so used to them now.Will Vanessa let me keep her spare hearing aids as well.
I had to agree,so 2 hours later Jill was wearing her new school glasses,with the new prescription in,I think while I was busy she must have slipped down stair and talked the technician into leaving the lens as thick as possible. 

Monday morning I joined Jill and the nurse in the form room,
The girls looked in awe at Jill,I heard one girl say,”look how big Jill's eyes look,I hope if I become head girl my eyes will look like that”.
All the girls that had been fitted with glasses said they missed wearing their glasses at home and all had headaches while playing computer games at home.(They all had to  hand their iPads and glasses in before they went on holiday)
Many of them had brought money to buy glasses for when they went home for holidays.
The nurse informed the girls that the Master said he was releasing the money for the rest of the girls in Jill's house group to be fitted with glasses,as he had looked at the exam results and noticed an improved in the girls work that were wearing the new glasses,
It was arranged that this week all the girl would have thier glasses,
Just as I was leaving the girl that missed her appointment came up to me.
“Please sir could I speak to you in private and explain why I missed my appointment”
So I told her to come to my office in her break time.
12 30 she arrived In my office 
“I can't wear glasses like the other girls sir”
“Why not”I asked
“I'm very shortsighted sir nobody knows that I wear contact lens, I tried a pair of the glasses that you gave my friend and I can't see anything.
Don't worry have you noticed Ambers glasses look different,that's because she is short sighted and was meant to wear glasses but hide them in her bag.
“If you go over there and take your contact lens out I will test your eyes now,while there is nobody here”
“I will start with your right eye,Can you tell me which letter you can see”
“Only the E sir”
After 20 minutes I had finished.
“You can put your contact lens back in now,then I want you to read the chart again for me,”
“Um just as I thought, when did you last have a eye test”
“5 years ago before I came here,I buy my contact lens online”
“I know I can't see as well in them as I used to,but it's better than without”
“Expect you noticed how much better your eyesight is with the test frames on.
This is your new prescription keep it safe 
R -7.75  -1.25  130 prism out 3
L - 9.75  -2.50.   90 Prism our 3 
Add 3.0
“You can come to my shop after school tomorrow to collect them,nurse will give you a pass to leave school”.
“I suggest you bring Amber with you,I will arrange a pass for her as well”

After school  the next day Margret and Amber arrived they were holding each other's hands “I took my contacts out before I came like you said,but I feel blind without them that's why Amber had to hold my hand all the way here”
I had wished I could have used 1.67 lens but the school budget only covered the basic lens so the lens were rather thicker than I would have liked for a young girl. 
Margret was very surprised how well she could see,
“Why are my eyes so small sir,I can never be head girl with such small eyes”.
I explain to to her that minus lens make eyes look smaller and plus lens Enlarge eyes.
As the week went on it became clear why many of the girl had chosen to sit in the front rows,they were short sighted,by sitting at the front rows none of the other girls knew that in fact they should have been wearing glasses.
By the end of the week we had fitted the rest of the girls in Jill's house group with their glasses,

I had not been to the school for about 3 months,when I got a phone call inviting me to the end of school activities and the master wanted to meet me first.
When I arrived I was shown up to the tower 
The master look very happy “Wonderful new for you ,the nurse informs me that none of the girl that now wear glasses have been to her complaining of headaches and their exams marks are exerelent ”

“The board of governors and I have decided that all the girls must now wear glasses as part of the school uniform,and must not been seen without them when representing the school even when going to town”

“Jill has arranged a university challenge type of competition in the main hall shall we go and join them”
“On The right we have the Big eyes team leed  my their  caption Jill and on the left the Little eyes team leed by their caption Margret”
I had to smile I guest that was Jill's idea how to separate the teams.


The next week was very busy, Many of the girls wanted  glasses to wear during their summer vacation,so I tested their eyes and increased their prescription.

Like before Margret did not want to be tested at school,so on the Saturday she came to the shop for her examination.
She looked very happy.
“I have got some exciting news”
“3 days after we had the quiz competition the master called me up to the tower”
“He was making plans for the next house group to be fitted with glasses,he had enjoyed watching the companion between Jill and myself,so I am being put in charge of that house and made deputy head girl”
I don't ever want to wear contact lens again.
“Mum is so pleased she send me money for new glasses to wear home”
“Can you test my eyes again please,last week I had a few headaches and things looked a little blurred when I went to town,it was harder to see the bus numbers” 
“Yes I can fit you in soon”

“This is your new prescription
R -9.50  -1.75 130  Prism 5 out .
L -11.75 -2.75  90.  Prism 5 out 
Add 3.75 
“I have increased it rather a lot then these glasses will last you longer as I expect you will only wear them in the holidays”
“Thank you sir.Mum has sent me the money for thinner lens,but I like being the girl that has thick lens sticking out behind the frames so can I have C39 lens like before.
“If you are sure that's what you want it's ok,Do you want to go upstairs and have a coffee,I think Vanessa is up there.
When the technician rang to say Margret’s glasses were ready I was busy with another customer so I told him to take them upstairs and Vanessa would fit them and I would be up soon.
When got upstairs Margaret was smiling,the technician must have heard her telling me she liked thick lens or Vanessa had rung down to him.
She had chosen rather large thin metal frames,the thick lens had been polished on the edge and were over 20 mm thick
As she turned sideways she said “ Vanessa said there was some money left from what my mum sent because I had the basic lens in these glasses so she found these hearing aids for me,I know they are very large but I love them and the girls will know I been made deputy head girl.
Vanessa looked at me guilty “They were old stock and we have not sold that model for the last 5 years” 
“I love the feel of them sitting on my ears. Vanessa has fitted them with these temporary buds in my ears and took a impressions to make me my own  moulds”
I then discovered that Margret was getting her deputy head girls badge and Vanessa had got the lab to make her a new pair of blue glasses with the new prescription in to wear.
Half an hour later Margret was taking off her glasses that her mum had paid for, she excitedly putting on  her new school glasses, the lab had made the lens  even thicker so the lens suck out beyond the frames much more than her old school glasses.
2 days later two beautiful young lady's walked in,one wearing her Harry Potter glasses with thick lens bulging out in the middle the other with thick flat  fronted lens both wearing their hearing aids.
“We  are going on our summer holidays now ,thank you for everything sir.
“See you next term”
