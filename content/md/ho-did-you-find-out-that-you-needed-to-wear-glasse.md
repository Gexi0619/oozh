How, did you find out, that you needed to wear glasses?


I am the oldest of three girls, in our family.
My name is Ashley, Kim is next, and then Nicole.
We are a very athletic family, at least twice a week, we go running, in the park behind our house, where there is a running track.
We also go to dancing, and gymnastics classes.
All of us are good students., and are very proud of our hair, and good looks.


My mother s parents, were visiting yesterday.
I had never really noticed before, how the thick lenses are, on the glasses they wear.
The lenses made their eyes look so small, as if they are at the end of a tunnel.
After they had left, I asked my mother about the glasses.
She told me, that both her parents are very myopic, which means, they have trouble, seeing things that are far away. 
You may have noticed, my sister, aunt Mary, has the same trouble, and she wears glasses, and both her children, are now wearing glasses.
How come, you don t wear glasses, mom?
I don t know, just lucky I guess.
A few kids in my class wear glasses, but they are not my close friends, so I had never paid much attention to their glasses.
None of my friends, like Kelley and Stacey, wear glasses. 
I don t know why, but lately, I am becoming more aware of people, who wear glasses.


Kelley told me to day, she has to go for an eye exam,.
When I asked her why, she told me, that she has a lot of headaches, and the doctor, after he examined me, suggested to my mother, that she should arrange for an eye exam for me.
Kelley told me, she is a kind of scared, this will be her first eye exam.


A couple of days later Kelley, came over to see me, and show me her new glasses.
I liked Kelley s new look, the lenses of her glasses, made her nice brown eyes, look a little larger.
Kelley, you look so nice wearing glasses, how do you like wearing glasses?
She told me, what she really likes, that it is so much easier to read now, but her distance vision is a little blurry, but the optician told her, that will go, and I will see perfect in a couple of weeks.
I like my new look, the glasses are comfortable to wear, I don t mind having to wear glasses.
Kelley, let me try her glasses, and when reading, the letters sure were larger, but I could not see well, looking at distant objects, everything looked very fuzzy.
When I looked at myself, was surprised, how different I looked, wearing the glasses, more grown up,
I sure liked that.
But, I don t need glasses.

At our high school, sports and track and field, are very important.
I am very involved, and almost every day, after classes, you can find me running on the track.
To day, while running slowly, to get warmed up, a guy, who I had never seen before, passed me, and yelled, catch me if you can.
I always like a challenge, so I really increased my pace, and soon caught up to him, passed him.
and waited for him at the starting line.
When he got there, he congratulated me, on a fantastic race, and introduced himself.
His name is Trevor, a very handsome guy, and he told me, he is a new student at our school.
He asked me, if I would wait for him, so that after we had showered, we could go for a cold drink,
I had a quick shower, and fixed myself up, to look as good as I could.
When I walked out of the locker room, there he was, what a surprise, he was wearing glasses,
and he looked fantastic.
Trevor told me, where he came from, and we sure, had a lot of things to talk about.
After mentioning, how good he looked wearing glasses, I asked him, how long he had been wearing glasses, and what is it like to wear glasses.
I started to wear glasses about 2 years ago, when I failed the vision test for my drivers license, my prescription is not very strong, I can see well enough, without wearing glasses, that I can do most sports.
I love wearing glasses, I like the looks, and feel of glasses.
Wearing glasses, has made me more confident.
Trevor, walked me home, I sure like him.


That night, lying in bed, I recalled, Trevor telling me, he enjoys wearing glasses, and my friend Kelley, being glad, that she is wearing glasses now
Now, I am wondering, am I missing something, not wearing glasses.
I like the looks of people wearing glasses, would I mind having to wear glasses?
When, I tried Kelley s glasses, and looked at myself, liked my more mature look.
While thinking about Trevor, and glasses, I fell asleep.


My sisters, of course, had seen Trevor walking me home, and wanted to know all about him.
Kim asked me, if I liked the looks of him, he is wearing glasses. 
I told her, I thought he looked very handsome wearing glasses..
Nicole then surprised us, when she told us, she would like to wear glasses. 
Her close friend Jenny, is wearing glasses now, she had trouble reading, what was on the blackboard, and the teacher, send a note to her parents, to get her eyes examined.
When Jenny came to school wearing glasses, I could not believe, how nice she looked. 
Jenny loves the way she looks wearing glasses, and find her glasses very comfortable to wear.
She let me try her glasses, I was very surprised, that I could see everything far away, so nice and clear. 
After trying Jenny s glasses, I am sure, I need to wear glasses.
Nicole told us, that she asked mother, if she could have an eye exam. 
The big surprise came, when mother, that night told us, we were all due for an eye exam, a week from Saturday.


Trevor asked me, to go and see a movie with him, on Saturday.
Of course, I accepted.
Well, said Trevor, we going to have a great time, and you might, enjoy my little surprise.
Now, I wondered what the little surprise might be.
When we arrived at the theater, Trevor led the way.
I like to sit, in about the middle of the theater, but Trevor took me to a seat near the back.
When I told him, I never had watched a movie, this far from the screen, he told me, you won t have any problem, seeing the movie from here.
So, I asked him, how do you know?
When we were talking, when we first met, and looking at you, I noticed you squint.
I know that this is a sign, that you vision is not perfect.
Well, here is something, that should help you, to see perfect, and handed me a glasses case.
GLASSES??
Yes, the glasses are my first pair, I think, when you wear them, you will see everything just fine, and experience, the exciting feeling of wearing glasses.,and I am sure you will look very nice.
I put the glasses on, and looked around.
What a surprise, everything I looked at, was clear and well defined, and wearing the glasses, sure gave me a kind of exciting feeling, I loved the way they felt on my face.
Trevor smiled, you look, like I expected, you look fantastic wearing glasses.
When the movie started, I was enjoying, how well I could see, and the glasses were so comfortable, Now I realize, why people don t mind wearing glasses. 
When the movie was finished, I kept wearing the glasses, and went to powder my nose, so I could look in a mirror, to see what I looked like wearing the glasses.
I liked, how I looked, I also realize, that when wearing a proper frame, I will look really good wearing glasses.
When I found Trevor, the first thing he said, Ashley you look perfect wearing glasses, I love your glasses look.
Trevor, I don t know, what made you bring your old glasses, but I sure like wearing the glasses, and being able to see so well.
Now, I realize, why you like to wear glasses, thank you for the opportunity, you gave me to find out, what it is like to wear glasses.
Trevor, I have a surprise for you, next Saturday I have an appointment, for an eye exam.
Ashley, that is exciting news, I am looking forward to the results. 
Now, I am looking forward to my eye exam.


Trevor had told me to keep the glasses, so I invited my sisters into my room.
When they came in, and saw me wearing the glasses, wanted to know all about them.
I told them, how Trevor had brought his old glasses, for me to wear, while watching the movie. 
I can see so much better, when wearing the glasses, that I am sure, I will be prescribed glasses, when we have our eye exam.
Nicole, after trying the glasses, was all excited, I sure can see much better, wearing the glasses, I will be like you Ashley, wearing glasses after our eye exam.
When Kim, tried the glasses, and looked around, said, I think, all three of us will be wearing glasses.
Don t tell mom, we will surprise her.


When mother, and the three of us went for our eye exam, my poor mother had no idea, that the three of us would be prescribed to wear glasses.
Nicole was first, and as expected was myopic, and prescribed glasses.
When Kim, and I, told her, we were also myopic, and being prescribed glasses, my mother could not believe it.
She talked to the optometrist, who told my mother, that when myopia runs in a family, sometimes not all members are affected, but is believed, can be hereditary.
Selecting proper frames, did not take to long, and after the optician was finished with us, told us that our glasses, would be ready in about two hours. 
My mother, still in shock, suggested we go home for lunch.


When we were having lunch, mother asked us, why we did not mention our vision problems before?
Nicole, told her that after trying Jenny s new glasses, and could so much better, and realized she might need to wear glasses
I told her, that I found out, after wearing Trevor s old glasses, when seeing a movie. 
I will show you the glasses, and went to my room to get them, I put them on, and showed her the glasses.
When Kim, tried the glasses, she to realized, how much they improved her vision. 
After trying our friends glasses, we all found out, that we had a vision problem.
All, my mother said, I am sure, I will soon get used to looking, at all my beautiful, glasses wearing girls.


We were very excited, when we went to get our glasses.
We could not believe, the improvement in our vision, when were looking around.
My mother, complimented us on our new look, and how nice all of us look wearing glasses.
That night, my dad, could not believe, what he saw, when walking into the house, his three girls, all wearing glasses
He had a good look, at each of us, and told us, you girls look beautiful, I love your new look.


Trevor, when he came to pick me up for our date, smiled, and kissed me, Ashley you look beautiful, you are the girl of my dream,
We went to see a movie, of course had to try each others glasses, and realized our prescriptions are almost identical.


My friends Kelley and Stacy, came over to see my new glasses, and loved my new look.
When they tried my glasses, Kelley looked very nice wearing them, but they are the wrong prescription.
Stacey, looked fantastic wearing my glasses, she said I never realized, I could look this good wearing glasses, and I love my improved vision, Ashley, I am going to keep your glasses.
When I told her that she could not have them, remembered, I still had Trevor s glasses.
Stacey, here is a pair of glasses for you.
When Stacey put the glasses on, told us, now I am sure, that I to, need to wear glasses,.
I can see, everything far away so much better when wearing the glasses, I never realized my vision is not as good, as I thought it was.
A couple of weeks later, Stacey was wearing glasses, she looks fantastic, and loves her improved vision.


That night, when I went to bed, took my glasses off, turned the light of, and before going to sleep, was thinking about, my sisters, Trevor, my friends Stacey and Kelley, and me all wearing glasses now.
What I found most interesting, is how we all found out, we needed to wear glasses!!!
