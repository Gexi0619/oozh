I have to do this story in  2 parts , I will add the second as a comment


The J ones family live in a nice neighborhood., not far from the mall
Kim is the oldest , she will be going into grade 6, her brother Jim will be going into grade 5.
Jim s mother who wears glasses for myopia, had noticed Kim squinting a lot , and sitting close to the T V.
She arranged for an eye examination, as she expected Kim was myopic, and should be wearing glasses.
Kim was myopic , and was not very happy when told she should be wearing glasses .
With her mother s help they found  frame that Kim liked.
When Kim was wearing her new glasses on the way home ,could not believe that she could see leaves on trees , 
and had no trouble reading every sign she saw,  which made her feel better about having to wear glasses.
At home that night , she let her brother Jim try her glasses.
I can t see a thing, everything looks fuzzy.
I guess I don t need glasses.

Jim started to notice that both his mother and sisters eyes looked so much nicer when they were wearing glasses,
and wondered why?

The summer holidays were over and they went back to school.
Jim noticed that there were more students wearing glasses now , and almost all of them had lenses like his mother and sister , that made their eyes look so much nicer.
He liked that look , and when he might need glasses, would not mind having to wear glasses with those nice lenses., 
but he could see just fine and did not need glasses.

Jim was given some assignments that required a lot of reading.
He was not very fond of reading , if he read to much he would get a headache.
His next report card was just about average , and his parents figured he could do better.
They asked him if he had a vision problem.
No, I can see the blackboard just fine.
Well then you will have to try harder.
Since the next report card was not any better, Jim s parents made an appointment to get his eyes examined.
They figured he did not want to wear glasses.
After the eye exam, the optometrist told the that Jim had hyperopia .
He could see well far away, but had trouble with close work like reading , and the strain on his eyes could cause head aches.
Jim should wear his glasses full time , and would be able to see everything perfect in a couple of weeks.
Jim was looking forward to get the glasses and his eyes would look so much nicer , just like his sister and mother.

When the glasses were ready, and Jim put them on , and looked in the mirror, did not like the looks of them.
The glasses were not what he expected.
You gave me the wrong glasses, the lenses look like Coke bottles , I have great big eyes , I  don t like that.
Sorry, these glasses are yours.
The lenses in these glasses magnify, the ones in your sisters glasses don t , that is why they look so different.

Jim s mother insisted he wear his glasses full time, so he would get used to wearing them, and do better in school.
After wearing his glasses a few weeks , he started to get used to them.
It was much easier to read for a long time, and no headaches , and he could see well wearing them.
He still wished he could have lenses like his mother and sister.

When going to High school ,Jim always had eyes for girls who wore glasses with lenses like his sisters.
He knew now they were for myopia.
How come he was not myopic like his mother and sister.
Jim would only  have dates with girls who wore glasses for myopia, they were so attractive.
Then he met Nicole.
Nicole was a sweetheart, it was love at first sight, she was beautiful, full of fun and wore glasses for myopia , she was perfect.
They were a perfect couple , and after graduating from high school they both went to university , Jim to become a teacher , and Nicole to become a nurse.

Time went fast, and after they graduated , it did not take them long to get a job.
Then they got married, Nicole with her new - 4.00 glasses looked radiant, and Jim was so proud of her.
After about a year they had save enough money to put a down payment on a house they both liked very much.
, and needed , because a few months  later  few months later they became the proud parents of a set of beautiful, healthy , twin 
girls..
Nicole was now a full time mother and she loved it.

Jim enjoyed his job as a teacher .
He taught English literature at  the high school, and was very popular with the students
He also directed the drama club, and they had some outstanding performances.
