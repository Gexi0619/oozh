I sure, was a foolish girl.

Being a girl, in a family, with two older brothers, is not always easy.
I get teased a lot, and find that sometimes, it is hard to get used to.
My name is Vicky, and I am a student in the fifth grade, at our local school.
I like music, and playing the piano, and have a piano lesson every week.
Amy, is my best friend, we have been friends, since her family moved next door, about two years ago, she is the only child in her family.
Amy's mother wears glasses, and Amy told me, that her mother makes sure, that she has her eyes examined, every year.
She explained to me, everything about an eye exam, and  what an optometrist does, when examining your eyes.
She expects, she will be prescribed to wear glasses, in the next few years, because, myopia runs in her family, most of her nieces, and nephews wear glasses.
I am not interested, in glasses, I would not wear them, because you look so different, and you get teased at school, and everybody, looks at you because you are wearing glasses.
Thank goodness, I have perfect vision, and never had an eye exam, it sounded scary, to me, blowing air into your eyes, and having to look at bright light shining into your eyes., that is not for me.

My parents, took me out the other day, to go to a concert, but the trouble was, we were sitting to far back, and I found it very difficult, too see, the performing artists.
However, I enjoyed listening, to the orchestra. playing, my favourite kind of music.
My mother asked me afterwards, how I liked the dress, of the soloist, I could not remember, because I could not see her very well,  but told my mother, I liked the colour of her dress. 

A new school year, will be starting in a few weeks.
Amy, told me, she was due for her yearly eye exam, and asked me if I wanted to come, with her and her mother.
I did not want to, but trying to be a good friend, went with her for her eye exam.
This was my first time, in an optical store, and could not believe my eyes, so many glasses, enough for the whole town.
While Amy, had her eye exam, her mother asked me, to come along with her, and look for a frame, that Amy might like, in case, she has to wear glasses. 
We looked at some frames, then, had me try a frame, to give her some idea, how they looked.
The worst part was, she wanted me to look, in a mirror, and get my opinion.
Looking at myself, wearing glasses, upset me, I looked so different, I sure did not like that look 
Finally, Amy came out of the examination room, and was all smiles, and  told her mother, that she is going to wear glasses, I can't believe it, she seemed to be happy about it.
After, the frame selection, and necessary measurements, and I don't know what all, we finally left the optical store, thank goodness, I don't know, why I came in the first place. I sure was glad we were going home.

Amy, asked me the next day, she would like me to go with her, to pick up her new glasses.
I had no desire to go back, to the optical store, and told her, I could not go, my mother wanted me to help her, do some house cleaning.

Amy, came over to our house, to show us how she looked, wearing her new glasses.
When I saw her, I could not believe, how attractive she looked, wearing glasses, my mother told her, she looked very nice wearing glasses
Vicky, would you like to try my glasses, you won't believe the difference in your vision.
No, I don't.
Come on Vicky, try the glasses, my mother said, I would like to see, how you look wearing glasses.
I had no choice, so reluctantly, I put the glasses on,.
Vicky, you look so cute wearing  glasses, I love that look, of course Amy agreed with my mother.
When I looked around, while wearing the glasses, noticed, that all objects further away, looked  nice and clear and well defined, that was the last thing, I wanted to find out, I wont say anything, otherwise my mother, will make sure. I have an eye exam, right away.
Amy, I don't know. how you can see better, wearing the glasses, I sure did not.
Well Vicky, you most likely don't need glasses, I love my improved vision., and love,, how I now look, wearing my glasses.
The summer break is finished, to morrow is the start of a new school year.
When Amy and I were on our way to school. a few of our classmates, noticed Amy wearing glasses, and had some smart remarks.
While we were waiting to enter the school, one big bully, started to tease Amy, and I walked up to him, and kicked at his leg, and told him to get lost.
Amy, soon felt better, when some of the  girls told her, how nice she looks wearing glasses. 
That is why I don't want to wear glasses, everybody has to comment on them, and I am sure my brothers would tease me.

In to day's paper, was an article, about the increase of myopia in school age children. 
At mealtime, my parents discussed the article, and my dad thinks all of his children should have an eye exam, to make sure, if they need to wear glasses. 
In the article, it mentioned, that a child,  would think their vision, is perfect, when it is not.
The next day, my mother told me, when my eye exam appointment was.
What am I going to do? 
I am sure, I will be told, I have to wear glasses,  I don't want to wear glasses, I can see just fine.
I am not going to mention, that I am going to have an eye exam, to anybody, Amy included.

I was sick to my stomach, the morning of the eye exam, I did not want to go.
Both my brothers, had their eye exam yesterday, and they don't need to wear glasses., I don't think, I will be that lucky.
My mother seems to think, I need to wear glasses, how does she know?

When we were in the optical store, I filled filled out the paper, with all the questions.
A lady, took me into a little room, and when seated, shot a puff of air into my eyes, I did not like that, then I looked into a machine, with a picture of I think a farm, at the end of a long lane.
Then she took me to the examination room, for my eye exam.
When the optometrist, looked into my eyes, with that bright light, I was sure he could see, what I was thinking.
Next he put a pair of oversized glasses, in front of me, and I had to read the letters, one eye at the time, I felt very confident now, I could read almost all of them, except a couple or three lines, then I heard some clicks, and now, I could read all the lines, that worried me.
When the Doctor was finished, he told me to be sure, to wear my glasses, when at school, and it would be all right to wear them all the time, if I wanted to., wearing the glasses, won't hurt your eyes. 
My mother, who was with me, in the examination room, now, knew everything.,
Then we had to select a frame, I did not care how good it looked, I was not going to wear the glasses.
My mother decided, which frame I should be happy with, and that she really, would like to see me wear, so that is the frame, I will be wearing, sometimes!!

The next day, after school, we went to get my new glasses.
After the optician, was finished, adjusting my glasses, I looked at myself, in the mirror on the desk, and sure, did not like what I saw.
The optician handed me a glasses case, and I put the glasses in there.
My mother asked me, why I did not wear my new glasses, they look so nice.
Well, the doctor told me, I only have to wear them at school.
After we came home, I had to show the whole family, how I looked wearing glasses, and listen to all the comments, I did not want to hear,
The next day, when I went to school, I had to show my mother, that the glasses, were in my backpack.

My mother, likes the looks of glasses so well now, that she went for an eye exam, and she now wears glasses, and loves wearing them, and can't figure out, why I don't like wearing glasses.

About a week later, when Amy was at our place, my mother asked her, how she liked Vicky's glasses. 
I almost fainted, when Amy said, I did not know, that she had glasses.
Vicky, why are you not wearing your glasses at school, like you are supposed to?
Because, I can see just fine without them.
Go and get your glasses, and put them on, so Amy can see how you look.

The next day, at school. was the worst day of my life.,
My teacher told me, I should be wearing my glasses, and please put my glasses on right now, and wear them all the time, like I am supposed to
Of course, everybody had to look at me, while I put my glasses on, and I could hear a lot of whispering,  I was so mad, I hated, all that attention. 

After a while, wearing my glasses to school each day, I became more depended on them, and soon started to wear my glasses almost all the time,.
Amy, had told me, that after she had tried my glasses, that my glasses, are stronger then hers.

I had been wearing my glasses, for about six months, when my mother took me for another eye exam, like the optometrist had suggested..
When, he handed me, my new prescription, told us, he wanted to see me again, in about six months, because of the increase, on one diopter, in both eyes.
Now,  realizing that I have to wear my glasses, all the time,  made sure, I selected a frame, that I really liked. 
When I started to wear my new glasses, sure noticed a big difference, in my vision, and now wear my glasses, from the minute I get up, till I go to bed at night. After  using my computer, I now, know a lot more about glasses, and myopia, and realize, that my prescription, of -2.50 on the right, and -2.75 on the left eye, is quite high, for the short time I nave been wearing glasses.
Knowing now, because I am myopic, will be wearing glasses, for the rest of my life, has changed my attitude, about having to wear glasses.
I am now starting to look more like a woman, and developing in the right places, has made me, more fashion conscious,  now know, that glasses are a very important part of today's fashion.

When, I started high school, my prescription, was in the -4.00 range, and I like the looks of my lenses, that show rings, and I am proud of the fact, that I wear stronger glasses then most,  and look forward to my next eye exam, to get an increase in my prescription. 
I now also know, that, a lot of guys, like girls who wear glasses, because at our school dances, I don't get a chance, to get off my feet, and sit down, and give them a rest.
Glasses, are an important part of my wardrobe now, and because my mother who likes to wear glasses, makes sure, that I wear the best looking frame available.

I now feel like a confidant young women, who likes wearing glasses, and  I realize, that beside looking good, your vision is good, and that a lot of guys, like your glasses wearing look.
It sure makes me now realize, I sure was a foolish girl, not wanting to wear glasses.
