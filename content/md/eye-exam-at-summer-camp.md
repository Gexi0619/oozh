There were two other aspects to my progression that I found interesting. The first was the progression of astigmatism. Until my first or second year of college, I had no cyl in my Rx. My sphere upon entering college was +2.50 to +3.00 (I don't remember exactly). I got my first cyl correction sometime shortly thereafter, in the -0.50 range. Over my twenties and early thirties the sphere slowly dropped but the cyl remained the same. By my mid-30's I was +2.00 sph, -0.50 cyl OU (roughly). Then in my later 30's my sphere started dropping to zero and my cyl began to increase, despite all the fantasies I harbored about becoming more hyperopic as presbyopia set in. I also noticed during this time that I started to need the reading add in my glasses. 

Throughout most of my 40's and early fifties, my cyl continued to increase, though it never got very strong and seemed to top out at -2.00. But I noticed that a lot of older people seemed to need a visibly strong cyl in their scripts, and recalled that several bifocal-wearing women I dated in my 20's needed fairly strong cyl corrections in their glasses. My wife has experienced the same progression. Her first glasses, readers at first, then progressives, had no cyl in the Rx. But gradually her astigmatism got worse. I looked again for her new Rx, which she usually keeps in a drawer on her desk, but only found her previous Rx from a couple of years ago: +2.50 sph, +1.50 cyl +2.50 add (OS) and +2.25 sph +2.00 cyl +2.50 add (OD) (forget the axes, but something like 45 and 75).  I'll be curious to see her new script. Hardly what you'd call strong glasses, but enough to really need them. I do notice that the cyl reflections are much more pronounced in her new glasses. In the light there is a strong diagonal component that flickers and dances at an angle in her lenses. That does give them the look of being stronger than they really are. 

I remember one woman I dated in college, an admin at the university, had a very pronounced cyl correction in her bifocals, but just a low plus sphere. Maybe it's common for the cyl to increase with age. 

One can only gather from this that college enhances astigmatism development. Which would make sense to me since my astigmatism has increased since I started college even being a relatively ancient student in my 30s.
