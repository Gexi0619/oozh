Marion was married to Bob, had a good marriage and they had a boy Andy and a girl Kathy.
Bob had a good job, so Marion stayed home to look after the family. She was industrious liked to sow, knit, cook and bake and putter in the garden.
They lived in a nice middle class subdivision, and got along well with their neighbors. Their next door neighbors were Jim and Ann, very pleasant people, who had a son Jack and a daughter Brenda.
The neighbors on the other side were Bill and Carol, they had 3 kids, Linda, Peter and Mary.
One morning when the girls got together for coffee and gossip, Ann was wearing glasses. She told them she had trouble with her contacts so had no other choice. The girls did not know that Ann wore glasses, so that was the main conversation that morning.
Marion asked Ann if she could try her glasses, and when she did everything looked fuzzy and distorted. Ann told the girls her prescription now was -3.25 and had worn glasses since high school. Marion said that she never had an eye exam and did not think she needed glasses. Ann s children had regular vision tests, and she had noticed Brenda squinting and thought she would need glasses after her next exam.
That night during dinner Marion was telling Bob about Ann and her glasses, how good she looked wearing them and about the whole family  having regular eye exams.
Bob said I don t like women wearing glasses. It spoils their looks, hides their eyes, there is no reason for women to wear glasses they can use contact lenses or get Lasik. He did not think regular eye exams were needed. He said there is nothing wrong with my vision and the kids have not complained.
Everything went just fine, Marion did her sowing and her knitting. She noticed that she could do it only for so long until she got a headache. 
At the next coffee meeting, Carol told the girls that she and Bill had made arrangements for an eye exam for all of them.
She said Bill had been told that a lot of health problems could be spotted by an eye exam, since the cost was covered , they all should go. They were to go the following week.
That night at dinner Marion mentioned to Bob, what Bill had decided about the eye exams. Bill did not want to discus it, nobody in his family had complained about their eyesight and they did not need eye exams.
When Bill and Carol took their family for the eye exam, the biggest surprise was ,when Bill was told he was aging a little early and should use reading glasses. Linda was slightly myopic and had some astigmatism and should be wearing glasses. The rest of the family was O K  their eyes were healthy.
When the girls had their coffee ,the eye exam was the topic of the conversation. Marion had some questions of how they did the exam, and about Linda having to wear glasses.Carol told her it did not hurt, but made you feel a lot better knowing that the eye health of the family was looked after. Linda would be getting her glasses in a few days and did not seem to mind having to wear  glasses and was looking forward to getting them.She liked the frame they had selected, and it made her feel more grown up.
A couple of weeks later Marion had an appointment with her Doctor she had more headaches lately. He checked her thoroughly and could not find any reasons for her headaches and suggested to get he eyes examined.
When she came home she told Bob what the doctor had told her. Bob said that was just an excuse,because he does not know how to fix your headaches.
Marion made  an appointment, and when she went  she found out her trouble was hyperopia , the doctor explained that she could see better far away than close up and by doing close work like knitting and sowing the eye strain caused her headaches.He gave her a prescription for glasses and told her she would notice some blurred vision on distant objects , but that would not last long .He wanted her to wear the glasses all day.
Marion was not upset about having to wear glasses, but the reaction she would get from her husband had her worried. 
When she  talked to Bob that night and told him, all he said was all they want to do is sell glasses.I never noticed anything wrong with your eyes, you seem to be able to see just fine.
The next day she talked to Ann, since she wore glasses and knew about them , she might be able to  help her.
Ann suggested she would go with Marion and help her select a smart looking frame. At the optical store the girls selected a frame with the right color and shape., that looked fantastic on Marion.She gave her prescription to the optician, he did the proper measurements and told them the glasses would be ready in about an hour.
When they went back to pick up the glasses and Marion put them on, Ann said Marion you look fabulous your husband will love your new look.
So Marion went home wearing her new glasses, they were  comfortable , and she liked the looks of them and could see close things much better.
When Andy and Kathy came home from school, they both said her glasses looked great but wondered what their dad would say.
When Bob cam home and saw the glasses, he did not know what to say. The glasses did not look bad, but he did not like women with glasses. So he did not say anything.
A few days later came a notice for Bob to renew his drivers licence.He went to the office and was asked to take the vision test and read the lines.The letters were blurry and he did not get them right. The examiner suggested Bob get his eyes examined and then come back and get his licence.Bob said there was nothing wrong with his eyesight. The examiner said O K just come back with a note from the optometrist , than you can get your renewal.
Bob was not in a very good mood when he came home. Marion told him she would make an appointment for him.
So Bob went to get his eyes examined , The doctor asked if he had any problems, and Bob said I can see perfect.
When the doctor finished clicking the lenses on the phoropter  and asking which was best. The doctor said I am sorry to tell you , your eyes are not perfect., they are healthy but you are myopic and will need glasses to drive  and once you are using them, you  might want to wear them all the time.Your prescription is -1.25 for the right and -1.50 for the left eye.
Bob was flabbergasted, he could not believe it.
When he came hoe and told his story , Marion said Bob it is not the end of the world you will see.
She suggested she would go with him to the optician and help him select a suitable frame.
He agreed and the went to the optical store. Marion handed Bob some different frames to try , and when he looked at himself with the frames on, his mood seemed to change for the better.He thought he did not look bad with glasses.
They selected a frame that Marion thought looked great and Bob agreed.
After they picked up Bob s new glasses they went home. 
Andy and Kathy told Bob he looked great, very handsome and studious  they  liked his new glasses.
Bob noticed that with the glasses everything looked sharper and brighter, and could not believe the difference they made.
That night Bob told Marion he was sorry for his behavior about glasses, he never realized what glasses could do for a person.
He also told Marion that she looked very nice and sophisticated wearing he glasses.Bob wondered if Andy and Kathy should have their eyes examined.Marion thought that was a good idea , Kathy had been complaining about having head aches . 
Marion would make an appointment for them.
Bob wore his new glasses to work and could not believe the positive reaction. He received many compliments on his new looks and that made him feel much better about having to wear glasses. He came to the conclusion that glasses were not so  terrible.They made you see better , look good and give you confidence.
When Bob cam home that night he told Marion how much better he felt about his glasses. He had no trouble getting his drivers licence renewal. He might even like having to wear glasses, they were comfortable.
The next day Marion took Andy and  Cathy for their eye exam. Andy did not need glasses , but Kathy had the same problem as her mother, and needed glasses.Marion took Kathy to the optician and helped her select a frame that would look good on her.
After about an hour they went to pick up Kathy s new glasses. When Kathy tried them on and looked in the mirror, she said is that me? That girl in the glasses looks real good. Kathy was happy with her new specs, she liked her looks and her eyes felt good.
When Bob came home that night, he complimented Kathy on her new look, he thought she looked terrific, and very grown up.
Marion was very pleased about the change in Bob s  attitude about glasses. 
Marion was happy , Bob seemed to like his glasses ,she was happy with hers.
A few weeks later Bob came home and said to Marion, did you know Carol next door is wearing glasses now?She never looked that good before. Marion said I knew she had new glasses, I am glad you like her new look.
