It was a sad day. After grandma s burial, the whole family was  gathered at grandma s house ,
where a lawyer was waiting to read grandma s will.
When he started read;
To mu only grand daughter Amy, my vanity with everything in it, a large trunk up in the attic , and 
$ 2000.00. . Etc Etc...

I am Amy this is my story.
I always loved my grand ma, we spend a lot of time together .
She always told me interesting stories about glasses. She had always liked wearing glasses.
When I was 12 yrs. old I had trouble reading what was on the blackboard, had an eye exam ,and was told I needed to wear glasses, 
I was not surprised .,my mother and grandmother were myopic , myopia ran in the family.
On my next visit to grandma, she complimented me how good I looked wearing glasses.
She told me to always enjoy wearing them, as they made you see properly, you always looked good and glasses were fashionable.
During the nineteen fifties , when she was in her twenties, had been a model to advertise different styles of  eyeglasses , photographs for newspapers and magazines  and T.V and fashion shows.
She showed me many of her pictures, and some of the glasses from that time , cat eyes , frames with rhinestones , and many others that were fascinating.
She sometimes let me wear some of the glasses, when I was sitting on the bench in front of her vanity.
The lenses were a little too strong , but I loved how I looked wearing them.
Grandma had shown me to love wearing glasses. 
Over the years my prescription increased , and when I graduated from college, my prescription 
was - 5.50.
I loved my glasses and the looks of my lenses.
After graduation I was hired by a insurance firm to work in the claims department.
I rented an apartment not to far from the office, and was happy to be part of the working world.

To improve my chance for a promotion, I started a night course at the university.
While taking the course , I met Ashley, a pleasant girl with a big smile, and great personality.
The minute I met her , I knew there was something special about this girl, I liked her very much.
Ashley must have liked me to ,because soon we became friends.
On our day off we would go shopping or go to a movie.
Ashley s last boyfriend had dumped her when because of an eye infection could not wear her contact lenses, he did not want to see her wear glasses.
Ashley was not to upset, she hated contact lenses and was not going to wear them again.
She liked wearing glasses,
A few weeks later , when Ashley and I had lunch together, she mentioned that she had received notice to move , as the building she lived in was going to be torn down, to make room for a high rise apartment, she had to start looking for another place to live.
I felt sorry for her , put my hand on top of hers and gave it a squeeze, and invited her to move in 
with me , which she accepted.
My apartment was big enough and could use some extra furniture , and with Ashley moving in with
her furniture the place would start to look more like home.
After she moved in ,it did not take Ashley to get settled and feel at home.
I enjoyed to have somebody around to sit with me to watch T.V. and to talk to.
One day when I tried Ashley s glasses realized our prescriptions were almost identical.
We had no problem wearing each others glasses which was fun.

On my next visit to grandma Ashley went with me,
It was not hard to tell grandma liked Ashley, and it was not long before she had to tell her all 
about her days in the fifties showing glasses,
Some of the pictures ans also some of the glasses.
On the way home Ashley told me how she had enjoyed the visit , and had found grandma  a very
nice and interesting person, and had enjoyed  all her stories.
