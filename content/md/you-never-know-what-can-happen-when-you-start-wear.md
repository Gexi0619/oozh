My name is Mark.
I have an older sister, Terry, I think she is a very smart girl.
She has good marks at school, likes sports. and is always very nice to me.
She helps me with my homework, is sometimes a little bossy, but we get along very well.
Terry is 2 years older than I am, she just had her 14 th birthday.
I noticed she has grown quite a bit taller lately, and starts to look more like a woman now.

To day when Terry was helping me with my homework told me , you seem to have a lot of trouble reading, I think you need glasses, and I will talk to mother about it.
So an eye appointment was made for me

I am not looking forward having to wear glasses, what would my friends think or say.
I did not want to be called 4 eyes
The next day at school when looking around noticed that quite a few students wear glasses,  and how good some of them look, and also more mature.
Hesitantly I told a few of my friends that I was going to have an eye exam.
Their reaction was a big surprise to me.
They told me that some of their brothers and sisters were wearing glasses now.
I now realize that wearing glasses is no big deal anymore.
I was feeling a little better now about getting an eye exam.

This was my first eye exam, a whole new experience  and I found it very interesting.
When the optometrist was finished, she told me I was hyperopic and had some astigmatism, and should wear glasses.
With my mothers help we selected a frame , that she thought would look nice on me.
I was confused, getting glasses excited me a little, but did I really want to wear glasses?

The next day my glasses were ready, and when I put them on and looked around everything in the distance looked fuzzy.
When the optician asked me to read, I could not believe how clear and sharp all the letters were, and how easy it was to read.
The optician told me that if I wore my glasses all the time my vision would be perfect in a couple of weeks.
I looked at myself in a mirror , and was surprised , I looked better than I had expected.

When I cam home , my sister told me she was glad to see me wearing glasses, that I looked fantastic.
She then told me she loves the looks of a man wearing glasses.
Glasses make men look so more sophisticated.

I wore my glasses that night doing my homework , it was so much easier now, and I was glad that my sister told my mother that I needed glasses.
When I went to school the next day , I received a few compliments , and of course a couple of the guys had to try them.
Surprisingly no nasty comments.

It did not take long for my distance vision to get back to normal.
I now started to like wearing glasses , liked the feel of the frame on my face and how I looked wearing them.
I now noticed that wearing my glasses  sometimes gave me a different exciting feeling.

A couple of weeks later one of my classmates, Logan came to school wearing glasses.
He told me he was myopic and had trouble seeing things far away.
He let me try his glasses, and when I put them on could not see very well, but I got that excited feeling again.
I gave him his glasses back and put my own back on , I again noticed the special feeling of wearing glasses.
When I asked Logan how he liked his glasses , he told he loves the feeling he gets when he put on his glasses,
His vision is now fantastic, and is a happy glasses wearer.

Wearing glasses gave me more confidence, and had no trouble talking to other people about glasses.
I found out that most of the glasses wearing guys I talked to had the same exciting feeling as I did
I now started to realize the feeling was sexual, the part of me that was now in development.
My friends and I now get together once and a while to discover and experience sexual satisfaction.

A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER.

My sister Terry now has a boyfriend,Jeff, he wears glasses
I like him very much, I like his type, we get along very well.
Terry went out with Jeff a few times, before they broke up.

It did not take Terry very long to get a new boyfriend, his name is Logan.
He is a studious type, handsome and wears glasses.
The two of them seem to get along very well.
Terry told me that when they went to see a movie , Logan wanted her to try his glasses
She was surprised that when she wore them she could see, but they were to strong for her.
The next time they went to see a movie, Logan wanted to sit in the back of the theater
Terry told him that she could not see to well that far away,
Logan then pulled out a glasses case and gave it to Terry.
I think you need to wear glasses, so I brought you my old glasses, I am sure they will make you see much better.
He also told me he loves the looks of girls wearing glasses.
Mark what is it like to wear glasses full time?
I told her I now like wearing glasses, they are comfortable ,and wearing the right frame you look great , and feel good about yourself.
She showed me the glasses Logan had given her  and told me that when wearing Logan s glasses she could see much better.
Well Terry it sounds you need an eye exam ,and your own glasses.

A couple of weeks later Terry was wearing her new glasses and she looked great.
Logan told he she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and how much he loved her.
Terry told me she had never thought she would love wearing glasses.

A few months later I got a real surprise.
Jeff, Terry s old boyfriend came to see me/
He was wearing very sharp looking new glasses.I thought he looked fantastic.
He came to ask me if I would like to go to a movie with him.
I liked the guy very much, and told him I would love to.
So we went to see a movie.
When we were seated to watch the movie , I told him how much I liked his glasses.
Jeff handed me his glasses , here try them.
His prescription was a little stronger than mine , I loved the feel of them  and could see well wearing them.
Jeff told me I looked fantastic and that I could wear his glasses for a little while and he would wear mine.
I got that fantastic feeling again.
Jeff put hi arm around me and gave me a hug, and told me how nice I looked .
Soon our hands were very busy, and we kissed , and had a wonderful time.
Jeff and I became an item and spend a lot of time together.

One night when I came home, after Jeff and I had gone to see a movie, Terry wanted to talk to me.
She told me I was sitting a few rows behind you at the movie.
What were you and Jeff doing?
Are you gay?

Yes I think I am , Jeff and I are in love.
Are you going to tell Mom and Dad?
No, I won t
When did you find out you were gay ?
 It all started after I got my first pair of glasses, they gave me such a nice sexy feeling.
Some of the other guys who were wearing glasses felt the same way.
We got together , exchanged glasses and played with each other..That is when I found out I like boys.
So now you know.

You never know what can happen when you start to wear glasses.!!!!!!
