*Just a short little fun story for a quick read on a summer night-Enjoy!
Summer Fireworks

The humidity was thick in the air and there was just enough other dust and stuff in the air that Katie’s eyes and her were doing some serious disagreeing.

Katie’s vanity still decreed that even though she was now 36, she hated to be seen in her glasses in public and didn’t really want to have to be seen at the 4th of July fireworks show in them.

Katie’s contacts though won the disagreement and she placed them in their case, pulled out her small brownish plastic rectangles, and put them on. They were definitely going to be her only option this evening as she pulled out of the driveway and headed to the park.

On the other side of town at his mom and dad’s place was Jake. Jake was also 36 and was in town to spend the holiday with the folks. Jake now lived several hundred miles away and was dreading having to go to the park. He loved coming home to see his parents, but otherwise he and this place had gone their separate ways.

Jake and his parents got into Jake’s Highlander and also headed for the park and to get their seats. The main road into the park was slow and Jake chuckled at what the people in the town would call a “jam”. 

His mom and dad ran into friends of theirs and Jake began to get bored at the chatter amongst the natives. He headed off for the snack stand to see if they had anything that could remotely interest him.

He turned the corner, looked a little ways down the path, and spotted what he thought might be a face he actually recognized. 
It sure looked like Katie Park, a classmate of his in high school and someone who 18 years later, he would admit, had a crush on in school.

Katie spotted Jake too and grimaced, about how cute Jake looked and how she looked the ugly duckling with her glasses on. The park was super busy so they exchanged pleasantries and decided to meet afterwards at the local bar to reminisce.

Katie sat at a booth in the back and waited for Jake to come in. The two had not been talking long when menus were placed in front of them. This was Jake’s oh-crap moment, he opened it up but it was blurry. He thought it funny; here he was trying not to be caught even though Katie was wearing glasses herself. All of the sudden, Jake announced that he had to go. As Jake walked out the door, a tear struck Katie’s face, wondering what had happened.

She was about to get up when she saw Jake come strolling back in. Jake saw the tear on Katie’s face and apologized if it was anything he had done. She was just about to speak up when he let loose his secret. “Sorry, Katie, I just couldn’t read the menu” at which point, he slipped on a black pair of readers and looked up at Katie with a smile on his face.

They joked about their glasses and had a fun time, heck they even had a fun time later that night (read into that what you wish) and Katie made sure to pick some place for breakfast where Jake would have to wear his reading glasses. Then Jake got into his car and headed back to his home now, happy and content and wondering if that firework might reigniteJ
