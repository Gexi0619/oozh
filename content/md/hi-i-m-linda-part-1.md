Hi anyone - I'm Linda. I just thought I’d post this ‘cos I’m feeling down. Anyone out there?
I’ve had a hell of a weekend. Why me? It’s at times like this, lying alone on my bed that I think these thoughts. Why was I born with crappy eyesight? I guess the law of averages says that every so often, someone has to be. I just happened to be there when the world was due for a myopic girl with a lazy eye in my neck of the woods. Honestly, the dear Lord wasn’t content with creating a girl with myopia, He had to also give me an eye that just wouldn’t follow the lead of its partner. Now, that really sucks! Can anyone cheer me up?

Hi Linda – can I be your friend? I’m Rich (short for Richard – which I hate by the way!) I’m so sorry you’re feeling down. I’m a good listener and I am also highly myopic – almost twice your prescription. I’m -15 in my left eye, and -15.50 in my right, and I too am totally dependant on my glasses to get around. What is your age? Do you have a picture? I’d love to see you.

Hi Rich. I’m glad you befriended me on here, because right now I need an ear to listen to me. I’m not going to tell you my age as I don’t need anyone coming on to me on here. I’m having great difficulty typing this using just one eye, so you’re just gonna have to listen – please? I broke my glasses on Friday. Well, the left lens dropped out of them onto the tiled kitchen floor, and when I tried to look for it I stood on it and broke it into pieces. I was sick! I’m totally dependent on them, and this was a complete disaster for me. I’m a minus 8.50 in both my eyes, but the left lens has a prism in it as my eye permanently turns in, and there’s no way I can make the two images come together without my glasses. Sometimes it makes me feel sick and disorientated if I go without them, like to the bathroom at night. If you look at me, I’m cross-eyed! I’m a disaster!

Linda – you’re not a disaster. You sound like a very nice young lady and I would love to see you. Have you got a picture? I will post one of me if you do the same. Please? How long have you needed glasses?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:38 pm
Since I was 4. I used to wear a patch on my good eye at school to try to force my left eye to work, but I hated it and I used to take it off. Then the double image would gradually disappear, but I found out later that my brain was switching off the signals from the lazy eye and ignoring it. It could have gone blind for good if I didn’t get the prism glasses. I’ve worn glasses since 4, ‘cos they found I was short-sighted too. I think I was minus 3 to start with. It’s just got worse and worse. I was supposed to get surgery on it to alter the muscle, or something like that – I’m no expert. But I couldn’t let anyone near my eyes. You know like when you mention the vet to a puppy and they know? God, how they know! Well, the “S” word – surgery – was like that to me! Nobody was ever gonna touch my eyes. No way! If it went blind, then so be it. Then I would deal with it. And I don’t ever regret not getting it done. My eyes are untouched and are gonna stay that way.

I too had to wear a patch when I was little, but I liked it because I used to pretend I was a pirate! My lazy eye rectified itself without needing surgery. But now I can’t see to do anything – even read – without my glasses. I’m 25 now, and I only had a 1 diopter increase at my last examination 6 months ago. I’m due another one now as they want to see me every 6 months. Have you been to the optician about your lens? How old are you? Do you have a photo of yourself? What is your boob size if you don’t mind me asking?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:43 pm
Rich – I’m NOT giving you a photo, I’m NOT telling you my age, and I’m DEFINITELY NOT giving you my boob size as you put it. Anyway, I’ll tell you right now, I’m a lesbian so I’m NOT interested in you other than as a friend with similar eye problems. GOT IT?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:44 pm
Sorry, sorry, sorry Linda. Forgive me. I didn’t know. I can’t chat up girls in person – I just can’t. I’m sure my glasses put them off and I just get a bundle of nerves. One time I had a date with a lovely girl but she wouldn’t go on a second date. I was going to kill myself. Then I came on here and found you. I thought my dream had come true. I just soooo want a girlfriend, and I’d love one with eye problems like me then we would have at least one thing in common. Please forgive me? Can we start again? I really am a perfect gentleman you know, and I can see you’re not like a lot of the girls on here. I respect that. I never thought I would come on here and find someone like you – it’s like a dream come true. When are you getting your glasses fixed? Can you post a picture?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:50 pm
Are you still there Linda?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:51 pm
Yes - still here. Rich – I’ll give you 10 out of 10 for trying! I’m sorry if I was abrupt with you. You do sound quite nice, so please forgive me. I would give you a picture if I knew you better. I went to my optician on Friday and he’s ordered a lens for my glasses. It’s a special lens with a prism, so it won’t be ready until Wednesday. I’m just staying in the house until then as I had to leave my glasses with them. I can’t go without glasses and I hate going with just one eye. I’m just listening to music, and struggling to watch a bit of TV with a very blurred picture. I’m useless! What do you do for work?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:53 pm
I’m a software developer Linda. I make good money, but that means nothing without a lady in my life. I would give it all up tomorrow for someone I could love. Do you have anyone? Have you always been lesbian?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:57 pm
You have a good job Rich. Yes, I have a girlfriend who has always been my best friend. We just recently discovered we love each other. She bought us both partner rings on Friday – they’re beautiful. But I used to have boyfriends too, so I don’t know what I am Rich. I guess you could say I’m bi-sexual. I really don’t care – as long as I have someone to love who also loves me, and that’s my Janey and me.

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 9:59 pm
Linda, Linda – I’d LOVE to meet you. Just for a coffee? In a busy coffee shop? Soon? Please? Say yes. Say you will think about it. What harm can it do? We can talk about eyes and glasses – nothing more than that. Go on – please? I know you are in the same city as me from your profile. I looked at it. I can't believe my luck!

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 10:03 pm
Rich – I can’t do anything until I get my glasses fixed. And I don’t know if I should meet you….. well….. maybe. What are you doing Wednesday afternoon? I could maybe have a coffee with you after I get my glasses back.

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 10:04 pm
Oh Linda – I can’t believe you just said that! Wow! You would really meet me? Wow! Let me pinch myself….. yes….. it’s real! How are you going for your glasses? Give me your address and I’ll pick you up in my car and take you there.

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 10:07 pm
Whoa there! Now just hold on – I’m getting a taxi there, so sorry – no lifts from someone I’ve never met. I will meet you afterwards, but just for coffee and a chat – nothing else. Do you know the Jupiter Mall on the west of the city? I can see you in the Starbucks there about 3:30, give or take 15 minutes. How’s that?

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 10:08 pm
I’ll be there Linda. It's near to where I live. Do you live near? You’ll recognise me from the glasses, and I guess I’ll recognise you the same. Oh Linda – thank you, thank you, thank you! I can’t wait to meet you! Don’t let me down.

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 10:11 pm
Rich – I'm not telling you where I live. And if I say I’m gonna do something, I do it. I’ll be there. But now I’ve gotta go. See ya Wednesday. Bye.

> Mon Feb 9, 2015 10:12 pm
Bye Linda – you’ve made me very happy.
Rich XX
