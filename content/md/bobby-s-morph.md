Searching the net for inspiration several months ago, I noticed a few recurring themes when looking for images of high myopes / myodisc glasses. The images in order of relevance (to the search parameters) tend to come up something like this:

Sandra, Queen of Myopia - Bobby Morph - Bobby Morph - Ladies Behind a Crystal Veil - Sandra - Bobby Morph - Sandra - Bobby Morph - Bobby Morph - Russian GWG - Sandra - Bobby Morph - Sandra - Sandra - Bobby Morph - Bobby Morph - Ladies Behind a Crystal Veil - Bobby Morph - Bobby Morph - Russian GWG - Russian GWG - Bobby Morph - Sandra - Bobby Morph - Bobby Morph (etc)

So as a tip of the hat to Bobby, I have rewritten the lyrics to Marcie Blane’s 1962 hit Bobby’s Girl. Bobby! Jekoje!   

Bobby’s Morph

(You're not a kid anymore)
(You're not a kid anymore)

When people ask of me,
What would you like to be
Now that you’re not a kid anymore
I know just what to say,
I answer right away,
There’s just one thing I've been praying for

(Chorus)
I need to be Bobby-morphed,
I want to be Bobby's morph
That's the most important thing to be
And if I was Bobby-morphed,
If I was Bobby's morph,
What a stunning GWG I would be

Each time you search the net,
That’s all you’ll ever get,
Those girls that Bobby’s myodisc-morphed
With all my heart I pray
There soon will come the day
That I see myself as -24!

(Chorus)
I want to be Bobby-morphed, 
I need to be Bobby's morph
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby-morphed,
If I was Bobby's morph,
What a stunning GWG I would be
On Google, Yahoo, Bing you’d see me
And what a happy, grateful girl I’d be
If Bobby finally would morph me!
