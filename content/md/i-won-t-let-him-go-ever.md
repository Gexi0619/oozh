Being super friendly was always my thing. I have always been the kind of girl that can’t be left alone for more than 2 minutes without making a new friend, and that has come with good and bad things.

On the positive side, I have always been welcome almost everywhere and people have a good concept about me. On the negative side, me talking to guys created insecurities on my ex boyfriends and the 3 relationships I’ve been in ended because of that.

One day, going into a convenience store I decided I wanted to eat a veggie hot dog and took a sit in the store, across the table like counter was a guy with his 7eleven shirt eating cheap ramen noodle soup. 

“I guess eating here might not be healthy but it sure is tasty right?” I said trying to make small talk but all I got from him was a smile (not even looking at me, still looking at his noodles)

“So, is your shift over or do you just like being here at the store?” I asked

“No, I just got here but I didn’t have enough time to eat” he said in a very soft tone

<Maybe he doesn’t want to be bothered> I thought to myself. But what if he had a bad day and needed someone to talk to?

“Ohh nice, have you been working here for long?” I asked

“Uhmm no, not really. About 4 months” he said and when I was about to make another question to keep the conversation going he said “It’s really no one's dream to work here, but things got a little rough for me so I had to take this job” he said

When he finally turned his head towards me I noticed he was wearing super strong glasses that were holding tight to his head with a strap. His eyes were almost invisible through the numerous rings his glasses had. 

“But anyways, at least I have a job. I have to go now, nice talking to you” He said as he cleaned his spot and walked away.

That’s the first time I’ve been speechless. He seemed like a regular guy, yeah I could see his glasses from the side but never had I thought such powerful lenses could be done. I don’t know that much about glasses, I use mine when I’m reading and maybe at night but I have never ever seen lenses like his.

I ate my veggie hot dog, grabbed my things and left, I couldn’t find a guy with thick glasses to say goodbye.

My day went by as usual and when I got home I could feel a small discomfort in my eyes so I took my glasses out of their case and put them on. I felt instant relief and that made me remember the guy from the 7eleven… If I felt that when I wore my glasses with almost no prescription at all, what kind of feeling must he get when wearing his? That thought immediately went straight to my thighs and I felt aroused somehow. What was happening??
I took a shower, went to bed and fell asleep right away.

The next day came by rather quickly, I still felt tired but it was time to start the day so I got dressed and went to buy some things I needed for my MacBook (I’m working from home in my own business so I have a lot of spare time when I need it.

I didn’t remember about the 7eleven guy till I passed nearby the store, I went in but he wasn’t there. I remembered his shift started about 3pm so I waited a while. I was in my car when I saw him walking into the store… I was excited!

“Heeey! Remember me?!” I asked excited. His head turned and his eyes scrunched up so hard I could see he had a hard time seeing me even from a mid distance. 
“Hey, how are you?” He said trying to be friendly but I knew he didn’t recognize me at all
“You’ve got no clue do you?” I asked and he nodded blushing
“I’m the girl you spoke with on your lunch time yesterday, remember?” 
“Ohh yeah!! I’m sorry, yesterday your hair was different right? He replied
“Well yeah kinda” I said “So, my name is Nicole, nice to meet you” I said
“Ohh nice to meet you Nicole, I’m Leo. Do you come here often? I haven’t seen you that much” He said
“Nope, I don’t. But I did yesterday and today I was passing by and thought to come and say hi to my new friend” I said and immediately thought WTF? Am I seriously flirting with this guy??
“Ohh well Hi I guess” 
He was shy and I knew I had to be the one making the first move.
“So, Leo, can I have your phone number?” I asked him
“Uhm ehh sure, yeah you can…” he gave me his number
“Is it ok if I call you sometime and maybe we can go for a beer? “ I asked
“Yeah of course, just text me and we’ll set something up”
We said goodbye and I went home. What haaaad just happened?!



-Good morning Leo! This is my What’sApp, so you can add me  (I’m Nicole btw)
-Ohh hey Nicole! It’s so nice receiving a text from you. I’m sorry I’m so shy in person, I’m a little insecure but you are very very nice.
-Oh no worries, I’m usually very friendly but I never ask or give my phone number to strangers, but I don’t know I liked you from the beginning.
- :O Do you like me? JK, I guess It was my lucky day then
-Hahah I meant you’re a nice guy 
-Well you should’ve known me a year ago, I promise you’d have fallen for me right away
-Would I? Btw you’re way more talkative on text than in real life
-Well yeah, I don’t get as self-conscious as I do when I’m in front of a beautiful lady 
-Are you saying you find me intimidating Leo? :O haha
-Well, not in a rude way. But you’re beautiful, way out of my league now
-What do you mean “out of your league now?”
-As I said before, a year ago my life was pretty different… It’s a long story but if you’re willing to read I’ll write it. It’s easier for me than talking about it, it’s still kinda hard to do so, yk?
-Well Mr. Leo, you’re on your lucky day cause right now I’ve got plenty of time to read and I’m gonna make myself a nice hot cup of coffee so you’ve got time to start writing while my coffee is ready
- (…Typing)
It took me about 10 minutes to get my coffee ready, and I still saw that ..Typing down his name. Was this story that long? Finally a notification came:

-Well, a year ago I was a completely different guy. I was pretty active and went to the gym every day, even tho I’ve never been a big guy, the muscles in my body were well defined  and that made me feel very secure around the ladies. (Not to brag about that but I always had luck with them, I know how to treat them and being good looking sure helped). I’m sure you have noticed my absolutely horrendous thick glasses, well I have worn glasses since age 14 but they were normal looking glasses, I was at -3.00 and -2.75 two years ago, but most of the time I wore contacts cause I hated the way my glasses looked (so dumb honestly). But I fell hard for a girl, Shen is her name, and she knew I was mad about her, so she treated me like crap but somehow I always went after her again until one day she went out with one of my best friends (the guy she was cheating on me of course) and something horrible happened: My friend fell asleep while driving and they crashed against a truck. Shen died right there and my friend was paralyzed from the neck down… I was devastated. I knew she never loved me, I was aware she was horrible with me but somehow I loved her so much. I got so depressed I couldn’t even get out of bed so I went to a psychiatrist and he gave me a diagnosis: Deep depression and generalized anxiety. So I was prescribed pills to help me get back on my feet.

-Oh my god, I’m so sorry to read that Leo. Please keep going

-Well, I started feeling better almost immediately. About a week had passed when I was back in the gym and my life was feeling almost normal again but suddenly I passed out lifting weights. Which was very strange because I had done it a lot and never had that problem. When I woke up I felt a little dizzy and I thought it was super normal. My vision started to be a little blurry but again I thought it was because of me passing out.  Days went by and my vision wasn’t improving, it was actually getting worse. I couldn’t see far away even with my contacts so one day, just as an experiment, I wore the contacts and the glasses together and I could see perfectly again. I thought it was super weird but I needed a solution to my issue and there it was. I thought about making an appointment with my optician but I got busy. 

-Uo oh, that’s starting to sound bad  … go on.

-Well, about two weeks later I couldn’t see with the glasses and contacts combination. It was simply bad, I couldn’t watch tv, I couldn’t read street signs, I had a really hard time seeing things. And I called my optician to make an appointment but he was out of town and I had to wait 6 more days to see him. In that week my vision deteriorated so much I could barely put my contacts in, I struggled so much cause I couldn’t see them unless they were almost touching my eyeball. Needless to say I couldn’t drive...

-:O 


-When I got to my optician, he immediately sent me to an ophthalmologist because he said he had never seen a case like mine and he was really worried. The ophthalmologist is his cousin so she saw me right away. She made all kinds of tests, called a fellow ophthalmologist and they both were amazed. They couldn’t believe  a month ago I only needed -3 diopters to correct my vision. They tested me with a machine and the power read -21.50 and -23.75

-What?? I’ve never heard of such a strong prescription :O

-Haha well fasten your seatbelt Nicole, I’m not even done. They took me to a hospital and I was admitted, I got blood tests, an MRI scan, even an EKG and everything was alright. The only weird thing was the hemoglobin levels, they were unusually low meaning I had anemia. When Tina, the ophthalmologist saw that she asked me if I was taking any medication and I told her Indeed I was, I gave her the name of the pills the psychiatrist recommended. “Oh no” was her response… The other ophthalmologist and she stood there discussing for an hour, I couldn’t even see where they were standing, all I could hear was their worried voices. “We’ve got bad news Leo” they said. To make a longer story short, they said that the pills I had been prescribed had that effect on some patients, they said it was pretty rare since there had been less than 20 cases known around the world, but all my symptoms matched and they were almost positive. I was one of those cases. I asked them what the treatment was and they told me unfortunately there was nothing to be done. My eyeballs had grown to a point of no return and they didn’t advise me to have any procedures done either because of the high risks of going fully blind.

-OMG Leo, and what did you do?

-Well I couldn’t do that much. Of course I stopped taking the pills and sued the company that sells them but that hasn’t come to a conclusion yet.  I was then prescribed strong glasses and they tried to make them as fast as possible. But by the time I had them they were already too weak. Now I was feeling bad because I wasn’t taking my pills anymore and I couldn’t see properly, although it was better of course than no glasses at all. Tina advised me to wait a few more weeks or maybe months till my eyes were finally stable… That didn’t happen quickly. I was under prescribed for so long I can’t remember what it's like to be able to see good. When I couldn’t see with the -21.50 and -23.75 glasses anymore, I went to Tina again and she did some tests. I was at -26 and -28.50 now. Again by the time my new glasses came I couldn’t see that well but it sure was better. That routine went on for a few more times, I went to Tina when I couldn’t see anymore and she prescribed me glasses.

-There’s no way glasses can go that high :O

-Yup, they can. In that year I lost the girl I liked, my sight, my job, my apartment, most of my friends, the ladies that wanted to go out with me, my car… everything. And I’m trying hard to get on my feet but it’s still so hard

-Ohh Leo, you’re such a strong man!! I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. Are your eyes stable now?

-Yes, although they’re very myopic and do not work without glasses or contacts anymore. I assume you have noticed my super thick lenses, those are a -25 each with some astigmatism correction.

-So your eyes got better?

-Nope, I also wear contacts. I need that combo, my eyes keep getting worse but not as much and not as often. My contacts are -9.50 and -13.75. But wearing -25 glasses is not easy, you can’t see that good even with them, they give you this kinda fish bowl effect and everything’s super tiny. I have a hard time reading small print or small size fonts on the phone. But I try to stay positive, at least I can still see.

-You’re so strong Leo. I don’t want you to be self-conscious around me, I don’t see your glasses, I see you.

-Aww Nicole you’re so sweet. I promise I’ll try to be less shy next time we meet

-Uhmm how about tomorrow??

- :$ What???

-Yeah, tomorrow: You and I and a cup of coffee…

-:O Are you asking me out, Miss?

-I might be  So what do you say?

-I have to warn you, I can’t drive anymore and I can’t see that good at night…

-I don’t mind, I can meet you there or pick you up if you feel comfortable with me doing so

-Uhmm where do you wanna meet me?

-What about Mortys Corner Coffee shop?

-Ohh yeah,  I’ll meet you there, it’s about 2 blocks from the place I’m renting J

-Nice, see you there at 6 pm?

-My shift isn’t over till 9 L Can I meet you there at 10 pm?

-Sure. We’ve got a date then…

-;) Ok. TTYS, sleep tight xoxo

- See ya!



Time went by so fast texting him, it was already time for me to go to bed.

The next morning I got up,  had a shower, went for a swim, got back home and checked some emails and stuff from my company and when I was making my lunch I couldn’t help thinking about Leo and how much he must’ve struggled. <How much could he see?> That's a question that to this day goes around my head…

My day went by as usual and about 8 pm I started to get ready for my date. I felt excited like I really liked this guy, but did I? I mean I had gone out with very fit guys, Engineers, company owners and here he was: A 7eleven employee, with the thickest glasses I’ve seen and still poor vision. His body was nothing to be excited about, he looked to be slim and that’s it. (Believe me I don’t care about money, but I don’t wanna date a guy who isn’t able to give himself what I can give myself)

<Give it a go, you’re feeling happy for the first time in a while> was my thought. So I wore a casual pastel blue dress that went all the way to my ankles but was open so you could see my good looking and exercised legs, a pair of white vans and my hair on a bun.

It was 10 pm when I was walking up the stairs and I got Leo’s text:

-Hey pretty, I’m already in. Waiting for you J

I got there and saw him waiting on a table next to the window. The view was quite beautiful because from here you can see a part of the city and its lights. He was wearing a white polo shirt, nice levis jeans and also a pair of white vans but the male version.

“Heeey Leo, it’s nice to see you again” I said

“Ohh hi Nicole. Wow you look beautiful, that dress really suits you”

“Oh you’re so kind, as always.” I said and greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. (A handshake was way too blah for this situation). We ordered our coffees and I could see him being anxious, his leg bounced and his left index finger tapped repeatedly on the table…

“So how was your day Leo?  I asked”

“It was ok, thank you. Honestly I don’t like my life that much right now. I feel like I got knocked down and getting up again is not that easy, but I still try my best” he replied

“That’s what counts Leo, trying again and again” I said. I don’t know if it’s his vulnerability or what but to me he seems irresistible. I like him a lot, I wanna hug him and protect him… Wtf is going on with me?

The conversation went on for at least two hours, at some point I grabbed his hand that was still tapping the table and he held mine back.

“I’m sorry, but we’re about to close” the waiter said and brought the check

“OMG, I’m so sorry I never realized it was this late” he said. When we were standing up I took my wallet out but he paid. 


He walked me all the way to my car since it was the only one left in the parking lot, I told him I’d drive him home, but when I tried to open the door I couldn’t… Guess who left the lights on? Of course it was me and I ran out of battery.

“Ohh no what do I do? Should I call the insurance company?” I asked Leo

“Well yeah, or maybe someone could pass you some power but I don’t see anybody here…” he said

“Damn! And my phone is out too” I said and I was beginning to worry

“Calm down, my place is a few blocks away. If you want to we can go there to charge your phone and come up with a plan” he said

“You sure? Wouldn’t you mind?” I asked

“No, not at all. I mean, it’s not an impressive place, but It’s clean and it’s better than being here waiting for a taxi to pass by” he said

We walked to his place and it was actually very close, he really couldn’t see that good at night and I realized cause his eyes were scrunching up a lot.

When we got to his place he got really really close to the door to put the key in the lock, we went in and he was right, he is a clean guy. His place was really nice, although nothing big or expensive looking but it was alright.

He took my phone and asked me to sit in the couch, he came back with a glass of wine and said

“Since you’re not driving tonight I thought a glass of wine was perfect to release some of the stress of this whole battery stuff”

“Well thought Leo haha, you’re gaining so many points already” I said

“How many points do I have to have to get a kiss?” He replied

“Well, I can tell you you already have more than enough” I said. I got up and kissed him. It was a sweet soft kiss, our lips played together but no tongue was involved.

“Wow Nicole, I must say you’re a great kisser.” He said, still holding me in his arms

“So are you Leo, I guess I can see why you had all the ladies” Stupid comment by me…

“Oh. Now you realize… I guess I am weird looking after all right?” He said

“Ohh no no, that’s not what I meant. Leo you are good looking, it was a compliment on your kissing skills. Please don’t take it the wrong way” I said

“No, no it’s ok. I get it, now you’ll say it was nice meeting me and we’ll never talk again. I know how this goes.” He said

“What?? No way, I wanna see you again. Leo I’m usually not so honest but I do like you a lot. Like a lot a lot” I said

“Do you?” He asked

“I do, I kinda was hopping I could see you tomorrow and maybe if you wanted to you could be my date next Saturday? I’m going to a wedding and I would love to take you with me” I said

“Are you sure? Aren’t you ashamed to be seen with me? Like people usually think I’m blind and it’s awkward” Leo said

“Well it’s not awkward for me, people can think whatever. I don’t care!!” I said and I kissed him again. But this time it was a hard kiss, our tongues finally met and it was amazing. I felt a rush of adrenaline going through my body. We kissed for about 10 minutes and then my phone rang…

It was my sister! I told her I was going on a date and she was worried because I didn’t text her to let her know I was ok. After assuring her I was fine, I went to my uber app but there were no cars available. I waited for about 10 minutes and then Leo said

“You can stay here if you want. I mean you can stay in my bed and I’ll hit the couch, it’s fine”

“Ohh Leo, but I don’t want to make you uncomfortable” I said

“I would actually be happier this way because I’d know you’re safe. I don’t trust uber drivers that much, not at this time at least” he said

“Ok, if you’re sure you don’t mind I’ll stay”

He couldn’t hide his smile, he was truly happy I was spending the night at his place.

“I’m not sleepy, so if you want to go to bed I’ll show you to my room” he said

“Ohh I’m not sleepy either. At what time are you getting up tomorrow?” I asked him

“I’m not going to work tomorrow so I don’t have to get up early” He said

“Nice!! Then, if you want to we can keep drinking wine, knowing each other and maybe kissing each other” I said

“Haha that sounds like a great plan, but there’s a problem” His face went from full happy to being worried “I need to take my contacts out, I can’t stand them anymore. But the glasses I have are about -8 and -10 diopters weak so I can’t really see and they are super thick.” He said worried

“Leo. I LIKE YOU. I don’t mind if your glasses are thick, I don’t care if you can or can’t see… I’ll help you out if you need to. Besides, you don’t need to see to kiss me, do you?” I asked him and gave him a kiss to relieve his stress

“You are not real Nicole. Thank you so much” He said.

He went to the bathroom and I went to my phone. I googled ‘What does someone with -10 diopters see’ and I found a couple of videos. OMG he really couldn’t see anything and those -10 were only a small portion of the actual power he needed.

He got back and I couldn’t see his eyes anymore. They were so tiny and his glasses had a weird shape, they were like bowls but on both sides… I couldn’t tell he couldn’t see because he knew his way around his place. I imagine this was his daily routine…

He sat down on the couch and he moved his hand around till he touched his glass of wine, that’s how I knew he actually couldn’t see.

“So, where were we?” he asked

I couldn’t help myself and I went straight to his lips. I started kissing him passionately, he responded to me the same way. I sat on top of him and I felt his glasses touching my face, I have never been aroused by glasses but he had a thing that made me go crazy. I grabbed them and he moaned, before he could speak I said “shhh, keep going” and I kissed him again, I placed his glasses on my face and they felt so heavy. I opened my eyes and immediately got dizzy so I closed them again.

Things got a little hotter so I took off his shirt and I was surprised by how good his body actually looked. He caressed my right leg that came out of my dress and his hand found its way to my butt. He was so hot!!!

He opened his eyes and I could see them moving weirdly and squinting hard, that was it. I was madly lost with this boy… I had to look above his glasses because if I tried looking through them I felt dizzy immediately and couldn’t see anything.

He got up with me still being on top of him and walked to his room. We made love for about 3 hours, I played with his glasses the whole time, I placed them on him, I took them off, I wore them… Everything you can think about.

When I woke up, I was resting on his chest and he was already awake, his eyes were closed but his hand was caressing my back.

“Good morning” I said

“Ohh, morning beauty. How did you sleep” he replied, still with his eyes closed.

“I can tell you I haven’t sleep this good in forever” I said

“Haha, nice to hear that. Hey sweetie, I’ll make breakfast alright?” He said. He moved towards me and gave me a kiss on the head. Then he got up and blindly went to the bathroom, I got to see everything he did from here. I saw his very nice <and large> body walking naked to the sink, I saw him pick up a container that had one of his contacts and how he brought it to his eyeball, I saw him repeating the process and then I saw him patting the sink till he found his glasses case, he opened it up and once again brought his glasses so close to his face I couldn’t believe he was already wearing such powerful contacts. He placed them on his face and adjusted the straps… 

“Ahh there we go, much better now” He said

I knew right there I wasn’t gonna let this man go, EVER!


… the end?
