When there is a will there is a way.


I am the oldest child in our family, my name is Brandon, next is Katy and then Amber.
My parents are very nice , and I love them ,Dad takes me out fishing and teaches me how to play base ball.
Mother has nice hair, and wears glasses that I think make her look beautiful. the sparkle of her lenses, and when you look at her glasses when she sits down, at the side of her face, the lenses, make everything look smaller and further away, I sure would like having to wear glasses like that I have heard my mother quite often say, where there is a will there is a way.

We go for regular eye exams, to make sure our eyes are healthy.
The last time we had an exam, I had a chance to try wearing some of the frames, that are on display, and I sure like the way I look wearing glasses, and I would love to have to wear glasses all the time.

This year when we went back to school, starting grade 4 , I noticed there are now 5 girls girls wearing glasses, and only one boy.
Why all the girls? 
That changed when a new boy came, he wore glasses, with the lenses that I really liked.
Kenny, had just moved here, from another town, and it did not take me long to be his friend.

When I asked Kenny, when he was at my place, playing computer games, about his glasses, he told me he started to wear glasses, about 6 months ago. but has just started to wear his glasses all the time, because at a new school, where they don't know you, they would not comment , oooo !!!. you wear glasses now, and tease you, and all that stuff.
Kenny does not mind wearing glasses , he likes the looks of them, and he does look good wearing glasses.
His two older sisters wear glasses, and his parents, they all are, what he calls myopic.
I asked him what that meant, and he told me, that everything in the distance did not look clear, without wearing glasses.
Glasses can do that? Yes they sure can.
I can't believe how glasses can do that.
You want to try my glasses, and see for yourself ? 
Yes, I love to, and he handed me his nice black framed glasses, the kind of frame I really liked
I just loved the feel of the glasses on my face and went to the mirror to look at myself, and loved my look,
Then I looked around, and went to the window, to look outside, I took the glasses off, and put them back on again, and noticed that when wearing the glasses I could see a little better.
I hated to give Kenny his glasses back, they were so great to wear.
We played a few more computer games, before he went home. 
It sure was nice to wear the glasses, I wanted my own, and remember my mother saying, where there is a will, there is a way.

At our next yearly eye exam,, bot my sisters were prescribed glasses, why them and not me?
That evening I hear my mother tell my dad, that she was worried, about Amber needing a prescription for -2.00 in her glasses, when she is that young, she might be a high myopic, later in life .
Dad said what about Katie?
Well she is starting to wear glasses, about the same age I was, and her prescription is about the same , as mine was at the time, I started to wear glasses, so I am not to worried about her.
The girls get glasses, and all the attention, what about me?

A new school year has started, and I must say, I learned an awful lot using my computer, this past summer.
I understand you can induce myopia, when you are young, by wearing prescription glasses, or contact lenses.
Now, where do I get my hands on a pair of glasses?

When I was home alone one afternoon, I looked to see if I could find a pair of my mother's old glasses, but I could not find any.
I could buy some cheap ones on line, but I do not have a prescription.
I took my bike and went to look around, perhaps noticing a pair of lost glasses. you never know.
After a long ride I went home, still no glasses.

The next week Kenny came to school wearing new glasses.
He told me, he had an increase in his prescription, and had to get new glasses. 
I asked him, if he still had his old glasses? 
Yes I have, my mother put my old ones away, in case I need them, for a spare pair. 
Out of luck this time, well I will have to keep on trying. 

A couple of weeks later, when walking down a street in town, I noticed in second hand store window something that got my attention, so I went in the store and had a look at it, but it was not what I had expected, 
When I walked around looking, I spotted a box, with sunglasses and some regular glasses.
I rummaged through the box, and found a couple pair of myopic glasses.
I tried them, in the first pair looked to me like a low prescription, when I tried the the other pair the prescription definitely was quite a bit higher, the price was 50 cents each, because there were only two pair of myopic prescription glasses, I decided, I buy both pair.
When I checked out my purchase, the woman told me, I think , the glasses are my sons old glasses, she took my money, and I was on my way.
I could not wait to get home.

I am home, and ready to go to my bedroom and try the glasses, when my mother called me and told me to go and cut the back lawn, I cannot forget that is my job.
Not until after supper, did I get a chance, to try the glasses. 
The first pair fit perfectly, and I had no problem seeing almost perfect.
My second pair were definitely quite a bit stronger, so I decided I wear the first pair for a while, and then the stronger ones.
All night long I wore the glasses, I loved my glasses, loved the feel of the frame on my face.
I had no problem doing reading and home work, but I had to take the glasses off, to go downstairs, to say good night to my parents.
Because, I could not let anyone know, that I had glasses, I put them in my school bag.
The next day at school, I wanted to wear the glasses, but I have to be careful, because both my sisters go to the same school.
The next day, when the teacher put pictures on the screen, and the lights were off, I put my 
glasses on ,and I sure noticed, the picture looked sharper and more clear.
When the class was finished, one guy came over, you wear glasses now? 
Yes, I do and they are great, I only need to wear them, when I have a problem seeing, what is on the board.
Now, I most likely can wear the glasses again. 
One thing I noticed, I see everything more clear and the contrast looks sharper, when I wear my glasses , I am sure glad I bought the glasses.
When I came home, I went to my room,, put the glasses on , and looked out of the window, with and without the glasses, and I now realize, I can see better, when I am wearing the glasses.
Now I tried my second pair, and I am surprised, that now I can see reasonable well wearing the stronger glasses, so I put the first pair away
When Kenny came over for a visit, and saw me wearing glasses, he said where did you get the glasses?
So I told him where the glasses came from, and when he tried my second pair told me they were stronger than his.
That made me feel good, I will make sure I wear them as much as possible, and I might be prescribed glasses at our next eye exam.
A short time later, I started to notice, that I had trouble, seeing clearly without wearing my glasses.
What am I going to do now?
Our next eye exam is still 3 months away.

The solution to my problem came faster, then I had expected.
I was wearing the glasses, during our math class, when my sister came into the class with a message for the teacher,
Katie, felt very important, and looked around, and noticed me wearing glasses, she just smiled and left the class room. 
When I came home, my mother wanted to know, where the glasses came from, and did I realize how bad that was for my vision, to wear just any pair of glasses?
Mom, I can see better when wearing the glasses, and I am most likely myopic.
Well we better find out, and she phoned for an eye exam for me.
Now, I can wear my glasses full time, till I have my eye exam.

The day of my eye exam, I was wearing my glasses, till I went into the store.
The optometrist, was very surprised about the change in my vision., and when I looked at my prescription, realized why.
OD. -2.75, OS. -3.00, and some astigmatism, and to wear my glasses full time.
That was like music to my ears.


At last I am a full time glasses wearer, and I love it, 
Like my mother used to say where there is a will, there is a way.
I am sure glad I found the way.
