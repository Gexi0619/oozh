At the Doctor
------------------
 
I was sitting in the Doctor's waiting room when the door opened wide, allowing a young woman to enter: she was about five and a half feet tall, and heavily built. She quite obviously had some weight problem, I thought. From my point of view it gave her interestingly large breasts, which wobbled slightly under her loose yellow top as she plodded up to the reception desk, whereupon she pushed her thick myodisked glasses up onto her face and brushed aside her fluffy blonde hair. She gave her name as Denise something, and was asked to sit down.

She immediately walked over to me, pointed at the seat next to me, and asked in a sweet voice, 
'is this seat taken?'
I said no, so she turned and reversed into it. As she sat down, she unintentionally pushed one of her large breasts into my arm: it felt like some big warm cushion, a bit unnerving, but not unpleasant. A moment later the whole left side of her body was pushing against me and it didn't let up. She did her best to budge up, saying apologetically,
'sorry, I'm a bit big.'
Now that was an understatement!

She again fiddled with her glasses, great big round-square metal frames with enormously thick lenses about half an inch thick, beautifully ground but undeniably strong myodisks. She looked at me full on, unable to glance around as easily as other more normal spectacle wearers could. Unexpectedly she told me
'I have a weight problem, that's why I'm here.'
I wasn’t exactly sure why she was telling me this and not the doctor: perhaps she was rehearsing what she was going to tell him. After a pause, she continued
'I also have an eyesight problem.'
That didn't surprise me, with glasses that thick.

She continued again,
'it's all to do with chocolate: I can't get enough of the stuff. Of course, I put on weight easily, but it seems to help my eyesight. I mean it seems to slow down my myopia - I've read something on the internet about it affecting the blood vessels in the eye - I want to ask the doctor if he thinks that’s possible.'
At that I was very interested, forgetting my own affliction for the moment: this overweight young woman of, what, 25, was getting fatter and fatter in order to try to boost her eyesight. What a hell of a deal, I thought. No doubt she'd have to try and get off the chocolate so that she could lose weight, but oh, in doing so, her myopia would accelerate, overall a no-win situation. She exclaimed
'I hope the doctor has some solution to all this! I keep trying to lose weight but have to go back to the chocolate after a while - it’s such a pain. I can't keep gaining weight like this!'

She regarded me with an innocent, friendly yet resigned look, opened her mouth to say more; but was interrupted by her name being called by the doctor, who’d just come out of his office to fetch her. So she got to her feet and plodded after him.
