Now, I can t wait for my next eye exam!




When you are a young boy, nothing, makes you feel more grown up, than starting high school.
I can t wait, to play on the football team, I am sure I have a good chance.
Lifting weights, and a lot of good food, and exercise, I think, have made me a good candidate.
I am always dreaming of being, a famous athlete, and making lots of money.
About 3 weeks, before school year started, I went to the try outs, for the football team, and was asked to come back, to practice with the team.


My best friend Eric, does not like sports.
He is a computer guy, and loves reading.
I am sure, he has been reading to much, because he has to wear glasses.
He told me he is hyperopic, I have tried his glasses, I can t see much far away, when wearing them,
but they sure, make reading easier. 
I noticed, that when wearing his glasses, his eyes look larger.
Eric looks good, wearing glasses, very studious, and girls seem to like his glasses look.
We both are good students, and spend a lot of time together, studying, comparing notes, and playing video games.


I am now a tackler on our football team, I tried for the position of receiver, but did not do to well. 
We have a pretty good team this year, and almost made the finals.
Well, there is always next year.


I am now old enough, to apply for my drivers license
Eric and I, went to the office together, after filling out some papers, Eric did the vision test, and passed.
When I, took the test, had trouble reading the letters, they were just to small and fuzzy.
The examiner told me, that when I came back wearing glasses, I should have no problem, seeing all the letters, nice and clear.
Me, wearing glasses, I could not believe it, my vision is perfect.
Eric told me, so you need to wear glasses, that is no big deal, you don t need to wear your glasses, as a tackler on the football team. 
When I came home, and told my mother, she said, I expected it, I have seen you squint lately.
I will make an appointment for you and Emily, I think, she also needs to wear glasses.
I have been myopic, and worn glasses since I was 12 years old, wearing glasses is no problem. 


Me, wearing glasses, I sure did not like the thought of it, what am I going to look like?
Eric is right, I can play football without wearing glasses, because of the position I play.
I now wonder, what is it like to wear glasses? 
Eric and my mother, don t seem to mind having to wear glasses.
Well, I will find out soon enough. 
I asked Emily, how she feels about, having to go, for an eye exam.
She told me, that she thinks, she might need to wear glasses, and does not reallymind, so many kids are wearing glasses now


The day of the eye exam, I was not very happy, knowing I would be told to wear glasses.
I still can t believe it, I am sure, my vision is almost prefect.
The exam was interesting, and at the end, when the doctor showed me, the difference of what I would see, when wearing glasses, and without wearing glasses, the doctor had, sure had showed me why, I need to wear glasses.
When the glasses were ready, and I put them on, and looked around, I would lift the glasses, and put them down again, and could not believe the difference, wearing the glasses made.
I had a good look at myself, wow, I seemed to look older, I liked my new look.
Emily, also has to wear glasses, and with her nice dark blond, log curly hair, looks fantastic, wearing her brown plastic frame glasses. 
My mother told us, how nice we both look, wearing glasses, and how lucky we are, with having such a large selection of frames available, to day, I did not have much choice, when I started to wear glasses.
While driving home, I looked around, and now realize, why I failed the drivers vision test..
When Eric saw me wearing glasses, welcomed me to the glasses club, he tried my glasses, and realizing, I was myopic, told me, with a big smile on his face, boy you sure are blind.
Brandon, you look so good wearing glasses, you turn me on, your new glasses, look does something to me.


I received quite a few comments, the first day, that I wore my glasses to school.
What surprised me most was, when a few good looking girls, told me how handsome I looked, wearing glasses.
That made me feel so much better, about having to wearing glasses. 
Well, after so many positive comments, I am sure, I must look good wearing glasses, I sure like the improved vision, and like the feel of the glasses on my face.
Now, I realize, I don t really mind having to wear glasses.


I guess, that I am like a lot of people who wear glasses, now, I notice, almost every person who wears glasses
Never, did I realize, how good most people look, when wearing glasses.
Liking girls, I soon noticed, every girl who wore glasses, and how attractive they look.


I asked Emily, how she made out, on her first day wearing glasses to school.
She told me, that there were at least 2 girls, who after trying her glasses, are sure, they to, need to wear glasses, and are going to talk to their parents,
A few of the boys, told me how nice I looked wearing glasses, there were no nasty comments. 
I sure do not mind, having to wear glasses, with the improved vision, and all the positive comments, I think I like wearing glasses.


Now, that I have my drivers license, and my dad will let me use the car, and with the money, I make at my part time job, I can ask girls for a date.
Since I like wearing glasses now, and the looks of glasses.
I now, only want to date girls who wear glasses, and the stronger the better, 
My first date was Karen, a very pretty myopic girl, wearing, a nice half frame with with, I would guess, -2.50, or perhaps -3.00 prescription.
Karen has very nice, long, auburn, wavy hair.
After I went to get her, I complimented her, how nice she looked.
After some talking about school, and other things,
Karen, asked me how I felt, about having to wear glasses.
I told her when I first found out, that I needed to wear glasses was not very happy
After getting the glasses, realizing the improvement in my vision, and receiving some compliments, I slowly started to like wearing glasses, and now am a happy glasses wearer. 
Karen told me, she started to wear glasses in grade 3, and her present prescription is now -3.50.
I loved the look of her eyes behind the lenses, and complimented her, how nice her eyes looked. 
I really wanted to try her glasses, to find out, what I could see wearing that prescription, but did not have the nerve to ask her, if I could try her glasses.
We went to see a movie, I had no problem seeing the picture nice and clear.
A short time later, I told Karen, that I had a hard time seeing the picture clearly.
You, most likely needed stronger lenses.
What is it like to wear stronger lenses, does it make much difference?
Here, I will let you try mine, so you can find out.
Boy, what a turn on, when she handed me, her glasses and I put them on.
I was surprised, I could see, reasonable well, and enjoyed the feeling of the stronger lenses so much, I hated to give Karen her glasses back.
I sure liked wearing the stronger lenses, and now cannot wait, to get an increase in my prescription.
Karen, who had tried my glasses, while I wore hers, told me, these glasses remind me of my first pair.
Brandon, you like wearing glasses? 
Yes, I do, I now, would not want to be without them, and I like my prescription to increase, at least a couple more diopters, I love the look of stronger lenses. 
Well, Brandon, I think, my might be able to help you, I will think about it.


On our next date, we went for dinner.
While waiting, for our meal to be served,
Karen said, Brandon, I have a surprise for you, she put her hand in her purse, and handed me a glasses case.
I think, you will look good wearing these glasses, they have a little stronger prescription, like you want.
The glasses, are my older brothers last pair, before he got new ones, and I think they are about -2.50, or -3.00.
I opened the case, and there was, a nice black plastic frame, with sparkling lenses. 
Putting the glasses on, and looking around, I was pleasantly surprised, how well I could see.
Karen told me, you are looking so nice wearing those frames, I love your new look. 
I wore the glasses all night, and could see well enough, wearing the glasses, to be able to drive home.
Liking my look, wearing the black frames, and the stronger lenses, it was not long before, I started wearing them to school.


About three months later, I could not see properly, wearing my old glasses.
When I mentioned it to my mother, she was surprised, and told me that she would make an appointment for me, she did not like it, that my vision had deteriorated.
That night she asked Emily, if she had noticed any vision problems.
Emily told her, that she noticed, she has trouble seeing, without her glasses.
My mother decided, that both of us were going to have an eye exam again.


My optometrist, could not believe the big change in my vision, and double checked to make sure.
My prescription in right eye, went from -1 to 2.00 and in the left from -1.25. to 2.25.
I was thrilled, much stronger glasses, just like I wanted.
Emily, had an Â½ diopter increase on both eyes.
My mother could not believe it, that much of an increase, in less than a year.


I loved my new stronger glasses, and Karen could not wait to try them.
When Karen tried my glasses, I tried her glasses, boy I loved that feeling of her tronger lenses.
Karen told me. she and her brother, are due for another eye exam, in a couple of months, and hopes she will have a change in her prescription. 


Time goes fast, and Karen mentioned to me, I am going for an eye exam to morrow, and I know, which new frame to select, for my stronger lenses.
A few days later when we got together, she told me her prescription is above -4.00 now, on both eyes,
and I will show you my new glasses, with the nice new tortoiseshell frame at our next date.


At our next date, I could not get over Karen s new look. 
The tortoiseshell frame, with the stronger lenses, showing some rings, blended so nicely, with her hair,
and skin color, she looked beautiful.
Well, Brandon, how would you like to try my new glasses?
Yes, and she handed me her new glasses, what an exciting feeling, looking through those stronger lenses.
Brandon, I brought my old glasses, I know you like a stronger prescription to wear, and handed the glasses to me.
I put them on, and soon realized my vision had changed enough, that I had perfect vision wearing the glasses.
Now, I could not wait for my next eye exam.


I had never realized, that eyeglasses, and wearing glasses, could be so exciting, I can t explain it.
Sports, and football, were the most important things in my life, now they are great to watch, on T.V.
Now, I would not want to be without glasses, and can t wait for my next exam, and the exciting feeling of a perhaps stronger prescription, and new frames.
