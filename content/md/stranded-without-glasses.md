The credit for the bulk of this story is given to Andy, who wrote the major portion.  I did add a bit, and ended it off, but the idea behind it was my friend Andy's.
Happy New Year everyone.

It had been almost three days since I had checked in to catch my return flight from Frankfurt to New York.  I was one of many in a rather large group that was unable to continue on their journey because the Lufthansa Pilots union had gone out on strike without warning once again. Unfortunately I was trapped in the pre boarding area. I would have changed my ticket to a train ticket, but there is no train that could whisk me across the Atlantic Ocean. Other than leave the airport to go to a hotel there was nothing I could do, but by leaving the airport I might risk my chances of getting on the next flight out, so I remained in the pre boarding area. As a card carrying member of Lufthansa’s senator class frequent flyer program I had a coveted place in the Senator Lounge with access to a nice bathroom with a shower. Management and the pilots were supposedly in continued negotiations, and a settlement was rumored to be imminent, but nothing had occurred yet

After I had been informed once again that my flight would be re scheduled for later that evening I left for a stroll around the terminal. It was the only thing I could do to make time pass just a little faster and it eased the boredom of just sitting.

Some of the people in the terminal were faces I had seen around there before during the forced stay. Most of them were not as fortunate as I was, because they had to try to sleep in the uncomfortable terminal chairs and had no access to the luxury lounge with the comfortable recliners that was available to others with Senator Class Privileges like me. 

I spotted the very attractive young lady in her tight business suit again. I had given her the name Smartphone-Lady, because she walked around with her smartphone almost attached to her nose. It was funny. As I had nothing else to do I decided to follow her to find out the reason for this strange behavior. 

I saw that she had the camera of her iPhone on and was looking at the picture as she moved around. I figured that the battery of her phone would not last very long with camera and screen always switched on. She reached the big monitor in the terminal, probably to check on when her flight was scheduled. I was correct. She tilted her phone upwards and with the familiar two-finger-gesture enlarged the image projected on the tiny screen of her phone.

I was only a couple of feet away from her and could see the low battery warning flash on her phone. I was curious what would happen next and I could hear her exclaim: “Oh shit not again.” She turned around and headed for a small coffee shop in the terminal, probably to get to a power-plug to charge her phone.

I followed her and was curious as to what would happen next. I had fallen back so that I was a few steps behind her and I went directly to a free table in a corner that I had spotted. In the wall next to my table was a power-plug. The coffee-shop was rather crowded and it turned out that the table I had sat at was the only one that had another free seat. She came right towards my table. Her face was hidden behind her iPhone, but she had a nice figure. The phone turned toward me and a pleasant voice from behind the phone asked me if the seat was free. I nodded my consent and invited her to sit down. She sat down and put the phone down on the table. She had a very pretty face, but her eyes were a little bit strange. She squinted them almost shut to where they were such tiny slits that I was unable to even see the pupils of her eyes, much less make out their color. I knew that this would be a very good day for me because I now realized that the reason for her strange behavior had to be that she must be extremely nearsighted.

I have this thing for women in glasses. Some would call me nuts for this, but it was my preference and there was nothing I could do to change it. She brought her purse close to her eyes and started searching for something. Her search became more and more intense, until she abruptly stopped. Her head turned slowly in my direction and she almost whispered: “I‘ve left my charger somewhere. Now I‘m really in trouble“. 

I asked her why she needed to recharge her phone. At least for now she could put away her phone for a couple of hours, I told her. Her eyes were watering now.

She then told me what had happened. “I wore my contacts to the airport a few days ago, but I forgot to put my glasses into my purse and I accidentally packed them in my suitcase instead. My suitcase is now on the plane somewhere and I can‘t reach it because of this bloody strike. I can‘t put my contacts back in because they are only good for one days use. My other contacts are in the suitcase, too.”

“So why don‘t you buy another set of contacts?” I asked her. 

“Because I have no money. My ex must have cancelled my credit cards and the cash I have on me is barely enough for what I need for my daily expenses while I am stuck at this airport.” she explained. 

“I‘m helpless without my glasses or contacts.” she continued. “With the help of my iPhone I can get around enough to be able to function somehow. But I lost my charger and my phone has only enough power left for a mere 10 or 15 minutes.

I was thrilled. This was a story that was quite to my liking and was the first positive thing that had come out of this rather inconvenient strike. Right then her phone emitted three beeps and went dead afterwards. She was silent and gently touched her iPhone as if she could somehow resurrect it.  I asked her if I could buy her a coffee or maybe something to eat. She gladly accepted my invitation for a coffee and as she looked at me I enjoyed the vacant look in her eyes. Our order came and we drank our coffee in silence.

“Oh by the way, my name is Pete.” I introduced myself.

“I‘m Jennifer she replied, but everybody calls me Jenny.”

We talked about her bad eyes and I learned that as she got older her eyes had started getting too dry and sensitive to enable her to wear her contacts for much longer than 10 or so hours a day. Some days she could only wear them for 4 or 5 hours a day and these 5 hour days were happening more and more frequently.  I felt like asking her what had been in her mind when she left home the other morning for an overseas flight without wearing her glasses, but I thought that would be like adding insult to injury.

As we talked a little longer I found out that she was also booked on the same Lufthansa flight to New York as I was. I was travelling in business first class, while she was booked in tourist class. This was good. An idea started to shape itself in my mind. First I would get her an upgrade to business first class with my bonus mileage. This would give her access to the lounge I was staying in and would permit me to remain in her company a lot longer. The next thing I had to figure out was if there was a way to get her a pair of proper glasses fitted. We had finished our coffee and I told her what I was planning. She accepted right away. What else could she do in a situation like this? I paid for our coffee and handed her now useless phone to her so that she could put in her purse. I took her hand and guided her out of the coffee-shop. I liked the feel of her warm hand in my hand as we walked side by side to the Lufthansa ticket counter. Everything went just as I had planned and Jenny got the seat next to mine. Then we went to the locker where she had left her carry-on. It was an expensive wheeled Louis Vuitton case that clearly had seen better days. Half an hour later we reached the lounge. I thought it would be more crowded by now, but we were the only 2 people that were using it. Jenny sat down in one of the comfortable reclining lounge chairs, while I went to the locker where I kept my carry-on to get my charger for Jenny‘s iPhone. In a little less than one hour her phone was fully charged again. She relaxed and returned to the routine of letting her iPhone be her eyes. She turned her phone in my direction and inspected me. I could make out a gentle smile around her lips and felt that this could be the beginning of a wonderful relationship. 

I went to the lounge‘s concierge and asked about the possibility of finding an optical shop in the terminal. The concierge looked at the airport register, quickly picked out a number and called an optician right away. She handed the phone to me and I explained Jenny‘s problem. I learned that they were a division of a large optical company but at the airport location they mostly sold sunglasses and contact lenses in the popular fast moving lower powers and other related items. This would be a first as they had never had a call to make a pair of prescription glasses. We were invited to come right over to check out the options.

We left immediately and headed to the optical shop where we were greeted by a very professional looking young woman. She said that they kept only an old trial lens set at the airport shop that they just used to fine tune contact lens prescriptions. Unfortunately they had no equipment to enable them to make glasses right here in the shop. Since we could not leave the terminal our only option would be to have Jenny select a frame that she liked and the glasses could then be made at the main shop at downtown Frankfurt. As our plane was scheduled to leave late that evening this was a good option. We decided to go for it. 

The optician asked Jenny if she knew what her prescription was. This time Jenny was fortunate because she had scanned her last prescription and it was only a few month’s old with her iPhone. She handed her phone over to the optician who looked at it and was silent for a moment.

“Oh your eyes need quite a lot of correction.” she said. 

The prescription read as follows: OS -16.75, OD -18.00 with no astigmatism. She immediately went to the phone and called her colleagues at the main-shop to see if they had the lenses in stock. They called back about 5 minutes later to tell her that they had the lenses in stock in a regular plastic, but they would need another day to get us high index lenses.

I was happy to hear that because this meant that I could enjoy looking at nice thick lenses on Jenny‘s face. The optician took Jenny to a small cabinet adjacent to the shop to check her prescription with the trial lenses. When she put the lenses in the trial-frame and put it on Jenny’s face she looked very sexy in them. Fortunately her prescription had remained stable so we were going to be able to go ahead and order a pair of glasses.

Jenny kept the trial-frames on to see what frames she wanted. We eventually found a nice rectangular pair of black Ray Bans that suited Jenny very well. I would have preferred slightly larger frames, but said nothing. If things continued to develop like I hoped they would, there would be plenty of time for me to add to Jenny‘s optical wardrobe.

The optician suggested that the lenses should have polished edges, which I didn’t agree with. I told the optician that in very high prescriptions like Jenny’s the reflections into the lenses were quite annoying to the wearer. She then gave the other lab a call informing them what frame we had chosen. She gave them all the necessary information and Jenny emailed them the scanned prescription from her iPhone. It would take 4 or 5 hours for the glasses to arrive.

The optician was willing to let Jenny keep the trial frames and also suggested that in addition she would lend her a pair of slightly tinted big sunglasses to wear over them so nobody would notice the strange looking trial frame she was wearing underneath. Jenny tried wearing the trial frames for a few minutes longer, but they were very uncomfortable and bulky to wear so she thanked the optician, but told her that she would be fine just using her iPhone as her eyes for a few more hours

The optician was going to call us as soon as the glasses were ready to be picked up. I paid for the glasses and we left the shop. Jenny was happy that soon she was going to be able to see again and I wasn’t surprised when she took my hand again. I turned my head and looked at her. Again I saw this gentle smile dancing around her lips. 

“I feel so much better now.” Jenny said.

It was mid-afternoon and we had returned to the Lufthansa lounge after lunch. I was sort of watching TV when Jenny‘s phone rang. It was the optician and her glasses had arrived. We returned to the optician to pick them up. They had done a perfect job. The optician placed the frames on Jenny‘s face. She heated the arms of the glasses and adjusted them slightly for a perfect fit behind Jenny‘s ears. Jenny said that they felt fine. The unpolished edges of the lenses came out of the frames back a mere 5 or 6 millimeters. Jenny looked absolutely gorgeous in those frames.  I was not surprised to see that they had done the lenses as myodiscs, but the thing that did surprise me was that the area that had the prescription in it was ground into a minus carrier.  I suspected that these lenses had been ground in the company’s own lens lab because a commercially sourced lens would have been done on a plus rear base.  In a frame with a smaller lens size the myodisc effect would not have been as pronounced because most of the carrier would have been ground off in the sizing of the lens. But in Jenny’s case, she had chosen a more up to date style of frame and the large eye size required them to leave a fair amount of carrier material around the area that contained the prescription Jenny required.  The black wayfarer frames did look quite good on her face though, and I made sure I complimented her on how nice she looked wearing her new glasses.

When we walked back through the terminal to the Senator Class lounge we stopped to look at one of the departure boards to see if our flight number was on it. Jenny spotted it first. There it was, our flight was scheduled to depart at 9:00 PM. With a 6 hour flight and a 6 hour time difference we should be landing in New York at 9:00 am.

“Do you have friends picking you up in New York?” I asked.

“No, I am not staying in New York. I have to change planes there for a flight to LAX.  I am visiting my sister in the Los Angeles area for 2 weeks.” Jenny replied.

“What a co incidence. I am flying from JFK to LAX myself. But I live just south of L.A. in Orange County, so I will be taking an airport shuttle to my home.” I replied.

“Do you know your flight number out of JFK?  Maybe we are on the same flight.” Jenny said with what I thought was a glimmer of hope.

“I know what it was, but now everything is up in the air.  I was switching to American in New York.” I replied.

“Me too. Should we go to see if we could possibly get on the same flight together?” Jenny asked.

This was getting better and better all the time.  I certainly wanted to carry on to Los Angeles with this now bespectacled, very attractive young lady and I was pleased that she had been the one to suggest that we travel on together.  To me this meant that there might be something for us in our future.  We went to see the representative of Lufthansa that was manning the booth at the gate, and we asked her if we had been re booked to carry on to Los Angeles.  She advised us that we had, and I was pleased to see that they had already rebooked Jenny into first class with me to Los Angeles.  My frequent flyer program had worked well this time.

Jenny and I returned to the lounge where we waited until our flight was called for boarding. First class was full to overflowing, as was the rest of the plane and that dashed my thoughts of possibly becoming a member of the mile high club.  I know, I know, some people have done it in the washroom, but that wasn’t really an appealing thought to me. I had mentioned this to Jenny in a manner by which she realized that I would love to do it, but had no intention of asking her to do it with me.

Sometime over the Atlantic I woke to find that Jenny had pulled my zipper down, brought my penis out through the opening and was giving me a blow job.  I waited until I had come in her mouth, and she had spit my cum into a few Kleenexes that she had on hand before I told her that this had not been necessary.

“Well, I owed you for getting me my new glasses, so I thought that the least I could do would be to initiate you into the mile high blow job club.” Jenny said.

I thanked her, and after we both went to the washroom to clean up we returned to our seats and slept until the light of day crept into the cabin. We landed in New York and had to retrieve our luggage. Jenny wanted to take her contact lenses out and put them in but I convinced her to leave her glasses on until we reached our final destination, and she acquiesced.  I suppose it wasn’t my request so much that caused her to accept my request, but was more because we needed to hurry to get to our gate for the final leg of our trip.

Jenny’s sister was waiting at the airport for her. I was planning to take a shuttle down to Orange County, but her sister Anita wouldn’t hear of it.

“Huntington Beach isn’t too far from Santa Anna, so I will be happy to run you home.” Anita said.

Anita was true to her word, and she navigated the Los Angeles freeway system like a pro.  She dropped me off at my house and before we parted company I had an invitation to come over the following evening for dinner.  I was pretty darned certain that this dinner was going to turn into a lot of dinners and if things worked out, maybe even into a permanent relationship with this rather attractive and very nearsighted girl.
