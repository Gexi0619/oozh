true story Who is who?


I know, I am not supposed to be this way, but I am.
At my age, you are supposedly, not interested in anything worthwhile., 
You should be sitting in a rocking chair and sleep
Not me!
Since I was a little boy, I was fascinated, and jealous, 
of any person who wore glasses.
I liked the looks of glasses and wanted to wear them, 
but had to wait a few years, before I was a proud glasses wearing person.


I recently moved into a retirement home, being catered to is one of the 
expected services.
In this home I feel like a little boy sometimes, why ?
Well everyday, I have the opportunity to look at a number,
which I consider young ladies, wearing glasses,




Now the real challenge is , who, is who.
There is a girl named Summer, and there is Caroline, Tiffany, Amber, 
and, Megan, and they all wear glasses.
What I like best is that they all wear glasses, with Myopia lenses
I love the looks of myopic lenses, and the look of the eyes framed,
when they are wearing a current style frame.




Now, what I consider is my biggest problem, who, is who?
Because of the times, they all wear a mask ,and sure makes them look,
all about the same
The next problem is, they all seem to have almost the same colour hair, 
and of course in a pony tail.
The only one ,I know for sure is Amber, she has I guess, a - 2.00 
prescription, and wears a plastic frame, without any colour.
All the other girls, all wear darker plastic frames, some with mixed colours 
on the temples, and they all are low prescription myopic.
Even their eye colour seems almost the same.


Now you can see the problem I have, looking at all those nice myopic 
girls, and not really knowing , who is who?
I donâ€™t think any of you feel sorry for me,
I know, I can feast my old eyes everyday, looking at glasses wearing girls.
How come, I never had that pleasure when I was young?
