So smart, and so dumb




Jenny, hurry up, we are going to be late.
Yes, mother, I will be there in a minute, as soon as I finish to putting my make up on.
My sister, is not in a hurry, she is very upset, because she did not pass the vision test, to get her drivers license,
now has to go, and have an eye exam.
I am glad it is her, and not me, I have perfect vision, and I am like Jenny, and I sure don’t want to wear glasses.


Wendy, is my name, and I am in my last year of high school, and looking forward, to move to city, 
so I can get a well paying job, and meet some new guys.
While going to high school, during my free time, I have been taking, an on line a course, in business administration.
I also, have been applying for some positions, and think, have some good prospects.
Less than a month to go, before graduation, I am all excited.


Jenny, as expected, has been prescribed to wear glasses, and with mother’s help, found what she told me ,
is a very attractive frame, that she likes and knows will really look good on her.
Her glasses will be ready, in a couple of days.




I could not believe my ears, when Jenny was telling me, that now, she is looking forward to get her glasses.
I cannot figure her out, and asked her why? 
After the doctor showed me, the difference in my vision, with and without wearing glasses, now realize, 
I should wear my glasses, to see properly.
With the frame I ordered, and some adjustments in my make up, I know, I will I look very attractive.
Wait till you see me wearing my new glasses, I am sure, you will be jealous.




Jenny, sure looks fantastic, wearing glasses, and at school received many compliments, and a date, 
with one of our football players.
When I tried, wearing Jenny’s glasses, and looked at myself, was surprised, how well I looked wearing glasses.
My vision, when wearing the glasses was certainly better.
In the glasses case was apiece of paper, and when I looked at it, saw numbers, like – 1.25. what ever that means.
I realize, that Jenny looks great wearing glasses, and I might look good wearing glasses, but no glasses for me,
all I want is, to move to the city, and a good job.




After graduating, and moving to the city, I was fortunate, to be hired by a small, but growing company.
It did not take me long, to get settled, in a small apartment, not to far from my work,.
Walking back and forth to work, everyday, gave me the opportunity, to become familiar with the area.
On the way home, I always do some window shopping, so I have some idea, of what is new, and the kind of stores,
that are in the area. 




In the office, I am working with two other women.
Mary, an older glasses wearing lady, and Pamela, a good looking girl about my age.
Pamela and I, usually have lunch together, and getting to know each other.
She also, is a country girl, so we have much in common.




Pamela and I went to see a movie, we sat in about the centre of the theatre, and enjoyed the show.
After the show, while we had a coffee, both of us mentioned, that we had a bit of a headache.
Going home, sitting in Pamela’s car, Pamela mentioned that the lights on the cars, showed halos,.
I had never experienced that before, until now, and I agreed.




After, having had the opportunity, to go home for the long weekend, both Pamela, and I had lots to talk about.
Pamela, mentioned that both her sisters, are wearing glasses now, and how nice they look wearing glasses.
When she had tried, wearing their glasses, had noticed an improvement in her vision.
I told her about Jenny, and that she likes wearing glasses, and lots of other stories.
Pamela’s mother had suggested, that perhaps she should have an eye exam, but she does not think, 
that there is anything wrong with her vision.




We met some nice guys, and are now double dating.
Pamela’s friend, Geoff, is a good looking, glasses wearing guy.
Brian, my friend, is a tall well build man, with a nice head of hair.
We went to see a movie, and had some snacks after.
The next day at work, Pamela told me she had to leave early, because she had an appointment.




What a surprise I got, when a few days later Pamela, came to work wearing glasses.
Pam, you look great wearing glasses.
Thank you Wendy, I did not realize my vision was so bad, no wonder, I had a lot of headaches.
When we were at the movie, the other night, Geoff let me try, wearing his glasses, 
that is when I realized, I needed to wear glasses. 
I am glad I did, my vision now is so good, I cannot believe it, and I like the way I look wearing glasses,.
I can’t wait for Geoff’s reaction, when he sees me wearing glasses, I am sure he will love it.
Pam, was right, Geoff, liked Pam’s glasses wearing look, and Brian also seems to like, the look of a glasses wearing girl,
because all he did, was looking at Pamela, and her glasses, and seemed to forget about me.




When, I had the opportunity, to try Pam’s glasses, and was surprised, how well I could see wearing the glasses.
I mentioned to Pam, how well I could see wearing her glasses, well Wendy, you better. get yourself some glasses to wear,
I am nor in a hurry to get glasses, I just do not like, the thoughts of having to wear glasses all day long.




The next time, we went double dating, could not believe my eyes, when Brian, pulled a pair of glasses out of his pocket
and put them on.
I failed the eye test, when I went to renew my license, so now I have to wear glasses, and now realize wearing glasses, 
changes your appearance, and I like my new look.
I noticed Brian, still, paying more attention to Pam, then me, and wonder why?
Then I realized, Brian prefers glasses wearing girls, well he can have them, I am not going to wear glasses, 
just to please him.


Walking home from work one rainy night, I noticed, the halo’s on the car lights, were very annoying.
I sure was not happy, when in the mail to day, was a notice, that my drivers license, was due for renewal.
Now I have no choice, and will have to go, and have an eye exam.,or fail the eye test, I hate the thought
but now, I have to go for an eye exam, and be prescribed to wear glasses.


When I had booked an appointment for an eye exam, did not tell anybody, that I was going to have my eyes examined,
I was very nervous, when I walked into the optical store, I felt as if, all those glasses, on display, were looking at me.
Trying to remember, when I had my last eye exam, realized, I was in grade five. 
After the optician, had done all the pre exam tests, I was shown, into the examination room, where the doctor was waiting for me. 
When the doctor was looking at the print outs, that the optician had given him, asked me how long, 
I had been wearing glasses?
I told him, I have never worn glasses.
Well, you should have, he used the phoropter, and adjusted it according to the print out.
After reading the lines, and is this better or worse ? 
The doctor then showed me, the difference in my vision, with, and without wearing glasses.
I could not believe it, what a difference, wearing glasses would make, was my vision that bad?
He wrote the prescription, and suggested I wear the glasses full time.
Me having to wear glasses, full time, I don’t know what to do.
Thanks to the optician, for assisting me, get a glasses frame, that I must admit, looked really good on me.
After doing the necessary measurements, the optician told me, that my glasses would be ready in about 2 days.




Three days later, I went to pick up my glasses.
The optician, after fitting the frame, asked me to look around.
First, I looked at myself, in the mirror in front of me.
I was surprised and realize that I now look, like a new person, and noticed that my lenses, showed some rings.
The optician told me that with a prescription like I have, I should wear my glasses all the time.
She explained my prescription to me, O.D. -2.75, O.S. -3.00, and about the axis and the cylinder.
I could not believe my vision was that bad.




I had some trouble getting used to wearing the glasses, thank goodness I had all weekend, to get used to, 
seeing and reading, wearing the glasses, my poor brain, got a real workout.
Sunday, afternoon, I went for a walk wearing my glasses, and noticed things, I had never seen before.
Now, I have to make a decision, am I going to wear the glasses, going to work tomorrow.
I knew the answer, right away, when I removed my glasses, and looked at a fuzzy world around me.




I went to work the next day, wearing my glasses, and realize , 
that am sometimes, so smart, and so DUMB.
