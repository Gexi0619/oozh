I have just posted the last of the specs4ever stories I had previously published in e Book format. All of these stories were destined for Bobby's site, but after he went to the blog format I decided I needed another way to get my stories out to people and I tried eBooks. Thanks to Val, and this site, I have finally been able to post them on the net.

I would also like to thank the readers for not posting any comments. I will admit to editing these stories once again prior to posting, but since the stories are not new, I felt that comments were not necessary, and they would move the stories out of sequence - even though I did number them as they were published in the e books. I hope you have enjoyed them all.
