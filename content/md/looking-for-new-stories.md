Hello, I don't usually make any posts but I was looking for some story recommendations.
I've already read a lot of the great stories in the forum, I'm mostly interested in stories with high myopia, myopia progression, stories about people who are forced to wear glasses or to induce myopia, and maybe even hearing aid stories.
Any recommendations are more than welcome.
