I cannot seem to comment to your story directly so opening a new post here.

Different Strokes for Different Folks: Story 7 from eBook 4 is a brilliant story. You have correctly identified the emotions and journey needed to become surgically myopic. BIID is an unusual diagnosis but very real. Like cosmetic surgery the operation transforms life. I can relate to most of what you wrote. Even with a BIID diagnosis I had to travel out of the UK for surgery. No regrets.
More stories please.
