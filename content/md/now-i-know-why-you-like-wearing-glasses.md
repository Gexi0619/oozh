I am  a very lucky girl.
I live in a nice house and my parents love me.
My name is Chelsey.
This year in my class we have a new teacher. 
I think she is beautiful,she has very nice hair and she wears glasses.
I never before realized wearing glasses ,could make a person look so attractive.
Her eyes look so bright and kind behind her lenses.
I never had met a person whose looks impressed me so much.
I would love to look as nice as she looks when I grow up.
I think I would like to wear glasses.
My mother wears glasses , but I hardley ever , see her wear them.
She wears mostly contact lenses, and she likes wearing sunglasses.
Her glasses the few times I have seen her wear them, never impressed me.
I really don t know what she looks like wearing her glasses.
She is a reporter at our local T.V. station, and heaven forbid she would be seen wearing glasses.

I like the looks of glasses very much , and I now take more notice of people who  wear glasses.
There are three students in my class who wear glasses, and they all look very attractive.
My class mate Amy came to school too day wearing glasses, she looks fantastic.
She let me try her glasses, I could not see very well when wearing them.
But when I looked in the mirror loved the way I looked.
I sure would like to wear glasses.

When I was talking with my mother , I told her about my teacher and Amy and how nice they look wearing glasses.
I told her I would like to wear glasses.
She said you don t know what you are wishing for ,
I hate the looks of me wearing glasses.
If you want glasses , I will buy you a nice pair of sunglasses, then you have your own glasses.

On a Saturday morning mother and I went to the mall.
She told me she wanted a new pair of sunglasses , and I could have a pair if I saw a frame that I liked.
When we  entered the optical store , I loved the looks of all the glasses on display.
While my mother was trying different frames to see what she liked,
I tied some frames to see what what I would look like wearing glasses.
It sure was a lot of fun trying all those different frames.
I really ;loved the way I looked , when I was wearing a real nice multi colored frame.
Wearing the frame I walked up to my mother and showed her the glasses, and asked her if I could have them.
She told me she liked the looks of the frame , and to go and see the optician.
The optician asked me how much tint I wanted on the lenses, and showed me all the different colors available.
I chose the lightest tint available, the lens was almost clear.
Sh asked me if I was sure ?
I told her I wanted the glasses to look lie real glasses
The optician must have understood what i wanted , because when my mother came, she told her we were all finished.
Later when we went to pick up our sunglasses , I put mine on right away.
I looked in the mirror and was so happy,the glasses with the little bit of tint looked just like real prescription glasses.
I loved my new glasses.
My mother was not very pleased and asked why I did not get a darker tint.
I told her I wanted the glasses to look like real glasses , so I could wear them all the time.
When we came home , my dad told me I looked fantastic, he loved my glasses.
My mother told him she was not very pleased , she did not want me wearing glasses all the time.
It is just a phase dad said, let her wear the glasses, if that makes  her happy.
So I wore my glasses all the time , and was a very happy girl.

Monday when I went to school . Amy and my class mates told me they loved my new glasses.
My teacher complimented me on my new look.
She also asked me , that since I wore glasses now to switch places with Katie,
who sits in the last row, and has trouble to read what is on the blackboard.
So I went from the first to the last row , and noticed the blackboard sure is a long ways away.
The teacher must have thought I wore prescription glasses, when she asked me to move.


A couple of weeks later Katie came to school wearing glasses.
When she let me try her glasses, I noticed that everything far away seemed more clear and sharper.
I started to wonder , do I need prescription glasses ?

Toward the end of the school year , still sitting in the back row, noticed I was having trouble  reading what was on the black board .
At recess I asked Katie if I could try her glasses again.
When I put the glasses on and looked around , everything I looked at was so nice and clear.
Now I was sure I needed prescription glasses .
I was all excited , real prescription glasses, but how to tell my mother?

That night at supper , I mentioned that I had tried Katie s glasses to day , and could see so much better when wearing them.
Everything looked so nice and clear it was unbelievable.
My mother told me to forget it , I don t think you need an eye exam, you just fancy glasses.
Listening to the conversation , my dad asked my mother to make an appointment for an eye exam.
He wanted to make sure my vision was properly looked after.
