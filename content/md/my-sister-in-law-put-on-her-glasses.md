I have been married to my wife for ten years now she is 32 years old, but she is not alone in the family.
She is the oldest daughter, then she has a brother and sister who is now 20 years old.
Before the wedding the engagement with my wife lasted five years, so it means that I have known Lisa for 15 years now.
A few days ago, returning from work talking about several things about us, he told me that he had had a long telephone conversation with his sister Lisa.
From the beginning I didn't pay much attention to what he was telling me, also because despite having 12 years of difference the two sisters often hear on the phone, also because we live in two different cities.
It is during the phone calls that a lot of things are told but not all of them interest me ...
However, one thing caught my attention.
When he told me that lisa had problems focusing, and she told me that for some time she had been unable to follow university lessons carefully, while in the evening she often had a headache and could not understand the because.
But he told my wife that he was beginning to notice that objects, both far and near, appeared to him doubled and with confused outlines.
Lisa lives in a college town and shares the apartment with three other girls, and Lisa told my wife about an episode that happened to him while he was at home.
One of her companions had noticed that Lisa had vision problems because of how she behaved, she thought it because she too had had them a few years earlier and that she had solved by putting on her glasses because she was astigmatic.
Lisa told my wife that her friend had made him try on glasses and that he incredibly saw us with his glasses even though his friend had worn them for a long time now.
That was how lisa confided to my wife that she gives
A few years he had begun to suspect that the sus vista had subsided somewhat, but that lately things had gotten worse:
he could no longer read and recognize people from afar.
Have I become shortsighted? He asked my wife ..
And he said:
I do not have the courage to go to an ophthalmologist because I am terrified to find out that I should wear glasses all my life while I have no intention of doing so.
And I know my boyfriend wouldn't like it at all. For now I keep on squinting when needed (and nobody sees me), even if it is not always enough and I am terrified that sooner or later someone will discover that I do not see well.
Closing the call with my wife saying she was in crisis ...
In reality, lisa was very worried as she had friends who had put on her eyeglasses and sooner or later, they began to need stronger and stronger lenses year after year and that she didn't want to end up like that.
Telling my wife about people who started wearing glasses just for the blackboard at school.
And after not many years he had to wear fixed glasses if not he doesn't even see where he puts his feet.
He added:
I don't even want to think the same thing can happen to me!
My wife replied to Lisa saying that:
Being short-sighted or astigmatic is not a tragedy!
You are doing the most serious thing of what it is!
The world is full of nearsighted people who continue to live normally.
Myopia, if it has to increase, it will increase anyway, it does not depend on whether or not you wear glasses and certainly to your friends who got worse after they put them the same thing would have happened, and perhaps it would have increased even more because you tend to squint your eyes by straining them too much.
My wife ended the call by telling lisa that it was necessary that she immediately booked a visit to the ophthalmologist because she probably had a vision problem and would have had to wear eyeglasses. 

Several weeks have passed since that call and I must say that I no longer remembered Lisa's vision problem.
Until a few days ago my wife told me that she had heard Lisa again, and that she had confided this to him:

I tried on my flatmate's glasses ...
The other day I was alone in the house and I started rummaging in my partner's room until I found a pair of glasses that she no longer uses.
I went to the mirror and put them on.
When I managed to focus on my image I discovered (but look a bit ...) that I'm really sick with glasses!
Instead the real surprise I had when I tried to look out the window.
Geez, it all seemed so clear to me. Even though I had a headache after a while, I could even read the shop signs across the street!
Mamma mia: don't I see you as my flatmate?
Who knows if his glasses would help me in university?
I have changed classrooms and I can almost no longer read the blackboard even by squinting. Help!!!!

So it was that my wife took the time to visit her sister and accompany her to the ophthalmologist.
To find out that lisa needed glasses and this is her prescription.
 ASTIGMATISM + MYOPIA
PERMANENCE LENSES: OD SF - 1.75 E CIL + 2.00 at 78 ° OS SF - 1.75 E CIL + 2.25 at 100 °

Now I can't wait to see Lisa with her first glasses!
