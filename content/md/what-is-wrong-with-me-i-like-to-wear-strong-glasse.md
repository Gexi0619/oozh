What is wrong with me, I like to wear strong glasses.
Part 3


A few days later, Kim, called me, telling me that she was back in town, and looking forward to see me Saturday night.
Come right over after work, I will have supper ready for you, when you get here.
We were very busy, at the optical store to day.
Since I am close to graduating, I now have the skills, to do a lot of different jobs, to help the optician.
I could hardly wait, to go and see Kim, she sounded so excited, I wondered why.?
When I arrived at Kim s place, and she let me in, she gave me a big hug, and said hurry up, and sit down, so I can tell you all my news.
Relaxing, while I had a sip of my wine, said, well whats the big deal.
Kelley, do you want a job as an optician, after you graduate in a few months.
Kim, you know I do, why such a logical question?
Would you move, to another city ?
Well, if it is a good job, why not.
Would you like to work, with me.?
What are you talking about?
Well, uncle Jim, has made me the owner, of his optical store, and it includes the building, and there is lots of living space, above the store.
I take over, August 1, I want you want to come, to work, and live with me?
Yes, Kim, I would love to, I think, we are made for each other.
Kim came over, and embraced me, Kelley, I love your answer, and gave me a big kiss.
The rest of the night, we were discussing, all the things we were going to do. 


What a fantastic day, graduating, and becoming a licensed optician, and contact lens fitter.
Kim, was in the audience, and sat beside my parents, I wonder what they were talking about.
After the graduation, was finished, my dad invited us, including Kim, for dinner.
When dinner was finished, my dad said, your mother and I think, and are pretty sure, the two of you, are more than friends, are we right?
If we are, you have our blessing, you are, who you are, and we have no other choice, than to accept it, like it or not, Kim you are now part of our family.
I had not expected that, I got up, and kissed both my parents, and thanked them.
Then Kim, did the same, with a big smile on her face.
The next day, Kim and I moved to our new home.


It did not take us very long, to get organized, with, the help, of uncle Jim, and his optician, who was glad to see us take over, as she wanted to retire.
We, certainly appreciated their help, and soon, we were running the business as good as before.


After been inside all day, we enjoy, going for a walk in the evening, and to get familiar with the surrounding area.
Some nights, we do our G O C, it was just as well we did not do C O C to night.
While walking down a street, where we had not been before, noticed a very interesting sign, 
It was a pub, we decided to go in, and have a drink.
As soon, as we entered, we noticed a difference, there were a number of couples, but all seem to be same sex.
We realized, we were in a gay, establishment, when a couple of women, asked us if they could buy us a drink.
We accepted, and it certainly was to our benefit, because when they realized we were, a couple new to the area, we soon, were surrounded, and they all were full of questions.
Where did we come from, were do we live, what do we do?
When we gave them some of the answers, they called an other girl over.
Cheryl, you wanted to know, where to get glasses, well here is an eye doctor, they operate the optical store on James street, now you know where to go.
Great, I know of 2 or 3 other people, who want to get an eye exam.
Knowing, what time, we had available, on our schedule for an appointment, the next day, I told Cheryl, what time, we could look after her.
That night sure was a profitable one, accepting a free drink, would bring us quite a few, new customers.


About 6 months later, Kim examined my eyes again, and we realize, my prescription has stabilized,
at -5.50, the strength I had liked, the first time, when I visited Kim, and tried all the different glasses. 
I still love strong lenses, and I am glad I reached my goal.


We met some of the optometrists of other stores, in town, and now have a better idea, about our competition.
There is no other optical store in our area, and with some new housing developments, and a new apartment building, and school, we notice an increase in patients, for appointments.

About a year later, we were getting so busy, we had patients waiting weeks, for an appointment.
Kim, and I decided, we would have to expand, to properly look after our patients.
We can convert the storage room, into an examination room, and add a desk in the store, so two patients can be served at the same time. 
To morrow, I will get in touch with a carpenter, and start the remodeling. 


Kim, also contacted, one of her classmates from the university, to find out if any optometrists were available.
About a week later, she received a phone call, one of her class mates, from university, was available, and will be coming to see us to morrow.
The next day, two glasses wearing gentlemen, came walking into the store.
They asked to see Kim, I told them, she would not be available, till she was finished with a patient, 
Can I be of any help?
I am a fellow optometrist, and my optician, we are here, to talk to her about the help she needs.
Kelley, is my name, I am the optician here, please take a seat, I will tell Kim you are here.


When Kim, was finished, I looked after the patient, for new glasses, while Kim, gave our visitors a tour of our store, telling them about the proposed changes.
When, our guests were ready to leave, it was agreed to meet for dinner, after we had closed the store.


We had a very enjoyable meal, with Logan, the optometrist, and Brandon, the optician.
They informed us, they were a couple, and it was all, or nothing.
After discussing the arrangements, that they accepted, would join our clinic, after the renovations are completed, and they find themselves a place to live.

About 3 months later, with an extra optometrist, and optician, and a part time girl, to assist in answering the phone, and other duties, we are still very busy.

That night, I mentioned to Kim, that thinking back, at all the changes in my life, is just like a puzzle.
The first piece, I wanted to wear strong glasses.
Next, my girlfriend Carolyn s help, in getting contact lenses.
Then, a new doctor, for our eye exams, who understood my desire to wear stronger glasses
The developing friendship, with the doctor, and her suggestion, to go into vision related studies., and 
her assisting me to reach my stronger glasses goal.
My girlfriend s uncle gift of the business, my becoming a licensed optician, and my parents blessing,
on being a couple.
And now being a full partner in a growing business.
I now know, there was nothing wrong, with my desire to wear strong glasses, look at the results.
