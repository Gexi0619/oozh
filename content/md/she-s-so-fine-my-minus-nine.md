My buddy rented a cottage at the beach one weekend many summers ago and a bunch of us drove up from the city for a weekend of partying.  I know he invited a whole bunch of our friends but I don’t think he counted on having quite as many people show up. By the time the campfire was put out Friday night there were 7 people sleeping in the cottage as well as 5 tents pitched in the sandy yard.  At the time most of us were in our mid 20’s and while there had been a lot of beer consumed there were no fights or problems. Actually the biggest problem was that the washroom in the cottage was overflowing with people trying to get rid of all the beer.

I hadn’t paid too much attention to all the girls that showed up other than to note that there were 8 guys and 10 girls there.  None of the girls really caught my eye or anything until closer to the end of the night when I noticed an attractive long legged girl with dark hair come out of the washroom. She was now wearing a pair of glasses with a pretty decent minus script.  I doubted that the glasses were a double digit prescription, but I could tell from the flat fronts of her lenses that they were pretty close.  I had never seen this girl before and I certainly would have noticed her around if she had been wearing her glasses.

We eventually all hit the bedrolls around 3am.  I had not had that much to drink and only had a slight buzz on when I finally drifted off.  I had managed to be introduced to the glasses wearing girl. Her name was Andi – short for Andrea.  What a bummer – my name is Andy – short for Andrew.  This would be a very confusing relationship.  I would have to work on having people call me Drew if I ever managed to get to date Andi.

People started stirring shortly after the sun came up around 6 am.  A few were able to keep sleeping but some of us dragged ourselves out of the tents and we sat around the remains of the fire and continued conversations we had started the evening before. Now I was able to get a closer look at Andi.  She still had her glasses on, and I suspected that they would remain on her face for the rest of the weekend. Lack of sleep, and close proximity to sand is not a good combination for successful contact lens wear.  I was sitting next to her and I mentioned that to avoid confusion with our nicknames I would try to get everyone to call me Drew, because a lot of my friends already called me that.

I really liked the looks of Andi, especially wearing her glasses.  That morning she had tied her long black hair into a pony tail and with her hair pulled back from her face I could see how pretty she was. Her greenish brown eyes were slightly minified behind the lenses in her glasses and there was a decent amount of cut in showing through the lenses.  From a sideways angle I could see the effects of the power rings at the sides of her lenses, and I loved that.  I had known for a long time that I liked girls who wore glasses, but while I had dated as many of them as I could find I had never met, or dated one who turned me on as much as this long legged nearsighted dark haired beauty with the shapely body and the nicest pair of tits I had ever seen.

I spent as much of the weekend as possible in Andi’s company.  We played beach volleyball together, we swam together and we went for a long walk along the beach on Saturday. She was witty and she was very easy to talk to.   Saturday night was an earlier night than Friday night had been and I spent every minute of it sitting and talking to Andi.  Sunday morning was similar to the previous morning and Andi and I were up early.  I had gotten her cell number and I was going to see as much of her as I possibly could when we got back to the City. She had come up with Brad and Jim along with her friends Kim and Stacey.  They all worked together at a store in the outlet mall that was located not too far away from my job and Andi shared an apartment with Kim and Stacey.  I found out during our talks that Andi had recently broken up with her boyfriend of almost 3 years, and that she was 20 years old.

I did tell Andi that I found her extremely attractive wearing glasses. Her lenses, which looked just thick enough to tell me that she was seriously nearsighted and couldn’t do much without wearing them, were set in a black plastic frame that had angles that were squarer than they were rounded.  The shape was more of a rectangle, but the rectangle had a shorter side on the nose side and both the bottom and the top tapered in a bit. The frame was just the perfect size for her face, not too small, yet not too big to be overpowering. She didn’t say too much when I complimented her – other than thanks,

I did notice over the 2 days we were together that Andi seemed to be squinting a lot, as if her glasses were not strong enough for her.  I was a bit afraid to comment on that though because we had already talked as much about her glasses as I thought prudent.  She had, without me even asking, told me that her lenses were -9D.  That surprised me because I thought they were a bit stronger from the amount of lens that showed past the edge of the frame, but I guessed that she had not spent the money for the high index lenses because she likely wore contacts most of the time.

I did call Andi after we got back home.  We dated for about a month, and I had not seen her wearing her glasses since the Sunday when we left the cottage.  I was beginning to feel that, although I liked her a lot as a person, her glasses wear was so nonexistent that it was not nearly enough for me.  I do not consider myself a glasses freak, but I guess I must be.  I am really attracted to a girl who wears glasses.  Finally, I invited her out for dinner on a Sunday, and I specifically asked her to wear her glasses for me.

She was wearing her glasses when I picked her up that afternoon and she looked just gorgeous. I told her so, and we drove to the restaurant I had chosen. The hostess placed us in a private booth well away from other people and I was having a hard time getting what I wanted to say out of my mouth. But finally I managed.

“You look so beautiful when you are wearing your glasses. I wish you would wear them more for me.” I said. 

“Don’t tell me I found another one of you guys.  I thought I was done with this.” Andi snapped at me.

What do you mean by “another one of you guys”? Explain please.” I asked.

“The guy I broke up with before I started going out with you was really into my glasses. He even wanted me to wear thicker and stronger glasses than I needed so I would make my eyes worse.” Andi said.

“And you lump me into that category just because I find you extremely attractive when you are wearing glasses and I would like you to wear your glasses more frequently for me?” I asked.

“I don’t know about you for sure yet. Bill seemed like a pretty ordinary guy when I first started going out with him when I was 16 and he was 19. But then he got really weird about my glasses.” Andi replied.

“I don’t think I would want you to get thicker and stronger glasses for me. I am satisfied with your glasses just like they are.  And I don’t mind if you wear contact lenses when you want to just as long as you wear your glasses once in a while for me.” I said.

“So if I wanted to get that surgery to fix my eyes does that mean you wouldn’t want to go out with me anymore?” Andi asked.

I thought about that possibility for a minute. I knew that my answer was going to have to be phrased very carefully, but I also knew what it was going to be. 

“I would be very disappointed if you did that but I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I would not go out with you again. I do not think that these eye surgeries are as safe as they seem to tell everyone they are and if your vision is fine with glasses or contacts I would far rather have you wear whichever you feel you want to wear at the time.” I replied.

“My eyesight is not that good right now.  When I got these glasses a year ago Bill wanted to know what my prescription was and I gave it to him. Then he ordered a pair of glasses online for me that was -3D stronger than these are along with a pair of contacts to match the power of the glasses.  When they came in he got me to wear them around the apartment and eventually I could see fairly well when I was wearing them.” Andi told me.

“Do you think that wearing the stronger glasses or contacts made your eyes worse?” I asked.

“I think that they probably did.  Bill was pretty sure that would happen.  I have been trying to wear these glasses or my weaker contacts since Bill and I broke up in the hopes my eyes would go back to this prescription.  That doesn’t seem to have happened though and I am having a really hard time seeing things at a bit of a distance.” Andi replied.

“What are you going to do?  Will you have another eye exam and get new glasses and contacts in your proper prescription?’ I asked.

“That is why I am having such a hard time deciding.  I shouldn’t tell you this because you won’t understand, but when I am wearing the stronger glasses or contacts I really like the feeling that my vision is so sharp after wearing them for only a little while.” Andi said.

“Problem solved then. Just wear the stronger glasses or contacts. I won’t mind.  Just for the heck of it though, why did you and Bill break up?’ I asked.

‘He wouldn’t commit.” Andi told me.

“You wanted to get married?’ I asked.

“Well, here I was ruining my eyes for him, so I wanted to get married.  I figured if I was willing to wreck my eyesight the least he could do would be to commit to me.  But he wouldn’t and he kept telling me that we would marry after I was able to wear -15D glasses.  My eyes didn’t have to have reached -15D, but I just had to be able to wear the glasses all the time.  So I told him that unless he was willing to marry me first there was no way I was going to even wear the -12D glasses.” Andi said.

‘I am glad that you guys broke up then because that left you available for me.  But honestly Andi a -15D prescription isn’t that bad.  I know a few girls with around -7D or-7.50D and they wear contacts all the time because their prescription just isn’t strong enough to attract the guys who like girls who wear strong glasses.  But a prescription of -12D is great, and -15D would likely be more than enough to attract any of the optically obsessed guys out there.” I told her.

‘Where do you stand?” Andi asked.

“I don’t know for sure. I like girls who wear glasses, but I am perfectly satisfied with the glasses that you have on right now..  And if you want to wear the -12D glasses you were telling me about, that will be just fine also.” I replied.

“You are pretty easy aren’t you?” Andi questioned.

.”I certainly wouldn’t force you into something you didn’t want to do.” I answered.

“The next time I saw Andi wearing glasses the black rectangular frame had been replaced by a rectangular wire frame that had rounded edges to the rectangular shape.  The frame size was about the same as her old plastic frame but the lenses actually looked thinner.  When I asked Andi about that she told me that when she and Bill had ordered the lenses for the plastic frame he had talked her into ordering regular plastic with a 3.0 mm center thickness.  But when it came time for him to order the -12D lenses Andi made him order 1.67 hi index plastic. They looked very nice. The wire frame had a touch of pink which looked fabulous with Andi’s black hair. She really looked fantastically attractive wearing them, and I made sure I told her so.

We dated for about a year before I asked Andi to marry me.  She had pretty much stopped wearing her contacts and I never tired of seeing her wearing her -12D glasses. 

“What – you want me to start wearing the -15D glasses now do you?” Andi asked.

“Run that one by me again. I don’t understand what you are asking.” I told her.

“Oh, didn’t I tell you before that Bill would only marry me if I was able to wear the -15D glasses.” Andi replied.

“Yeah, you told me that. And I told you that as long as you were with me you had the choice to do whatever you wanted yourself.” I said, and then a little light went off in my head. “And you never told me that Bill had bought you a pair of -15D glasses before you and he split up. Did he?”

“No, he didn’t. I was just joking around with you there.  But I did buy myself a pair of glasses with a prescription of -15D from an online source a couple of months ago.  I had noticed that over the past year my vision had completely adapted to these -12D ones I am wearing and I thought I would order myself a pair of -15D ones just in case you ever got around to asking me to marry you.” Andi responded.

“I have to admit that having you wear a pair of glasses with -15D lenses would be my idea of utter perfection.  But I don’t want you to do anything like that unless you want to.” I replied.

“Don’t worry, I won’t.” Andi said.

With that Andi went and got the new glasses she had ordered.  They were a similar style to the wire frames she already was wearing, but the color now was in a pale purple.  And the cut in was significantly more noticeable than it had been with her -12D glasses.  It didn’t take her long before she had pretty well adapted to the increased power in the lenses.  I had discussed the possibility with her that if we had kids, and we both wanted them, that her already nearsighted vision might deteriorate slightly during or just after her pregnancy, especially if she breast fed our child.

“How much worse might my eyes get?’ Andi asked.

“It might not get any worse. But a lot of the girls I have known or read about have had a deterioration of somewhere between -1D and -3D.  The absolute worst case scenario that I have read about was a girl who had an increase in her prescription from -11D up to over -20D with only one child.  But that is an extreme case and might only occur one time in a million.” I answered.

‘I wouldn’t like to have my eyes get worse by -9D, but I wouldn’t mind -1D or so for each child. That would only get me up to -17.00D.”  Andi said.

“As long as you are aware of the problem I don’t care if you need a bit stronger prescription.” I told her.

We did marry and I managed to convince Andi that I would like it a lot if she didn’t bother spending her money on new contact lenses for the wedding.  There were a few pictures in which she was shown without her glasses, but her glasses were safe, secure and readily accessible in my jacket breast pocket.  A couple of the pictures were not usable because the red marks on her nose that were left by her glasses were too visible.  Most of the pictures we chose for our wedding album did show Andi wearing glasses though.  Fortunately Andi had completely accepted the fact that I loved seeing her wearing glasses, and she didn’t even think I was a little bit crazy because of that.

We had been married for about 6 months and Andi was now almost 22 when she did become pregnant.  As it came closer and closer to the time for her to have the baby she discovered that her eyesight had completely adapted to the -15D glasses and in actual fact had even gotten slightly worse.  But she didn’t feel that she wanted new glasses yet and we decided that we would wait for a while to see if her eyes bounced back to about the same prescription she had in her glasses.

Andi breast fed for the first year and by the time Abigail was starting to eat a bit of solid food she switched Abby to formula for any bottles we fed her.  Andi’s milk production dried up, but her vision did not get any better and she made an appointment with an eye doctor for a complete vision exam.  We did not know exactly what prescription Andi had started out her pregnancy with, but now we knew that her prescription was exactly -16D and new glasses were ordered.

When Abby was a year old Andi became pregnant again.  By the time Ben was born Andi felt that she would not be willing to wait until after she was finished breast feeding before she got herself new glasses, and this time her prescription was going to be -17.50.  This indicated to us that she had likely been around -14.50D when she became pregnant with Abby, and each pregnancy had cost her about -1.50D.  I thought that her -17.50D glasses were the most beautiful pair of glasses I had ever seen and I couldn’t get enough of looking at her wearing them

A little over a year later when Ben was walking and had grown 8 or 9 teeth Andi stopped breast feeding him.  She was tired of him biting her breasts and I didn’t blame her one bit.  But she needed to have another eye exam and this time her prescription had jumped another -0.50D.  Andi and I discussed it, and Andi was the one who decided that she wanted to order glasses with lenses that were -0.50D stronger than her real prescription, so she ended up with new glasses that were -18.50.  We ordered one pair that had the 1.74 index lenses, and these lenses were almost a full field lens. The second pair was ordered in 1.67 index, and they were shaved off at the outer edges, giving almost a myodisc appearance to them. I was enthralled with both pairs and could not have chosen which pair I wanted her to wear to save my life.

Not too long ago Andi and I were walking in the mall with both kids.  Ben was wearing his retractable harness, so I suppose he was around 2 years old.  I noticed another couple walking towards us, and as they drew closer I could tell that the lady was wearing an extremely strong pair of myodiscs.  She could have been cute, but she really wasn’t the most attractive lady I had ever seen, as she was a little heavy, and a lot shorter than Andi.  The man wasn’t bad looking though and what surprised me was that he too was wearing myodiscs.  As they came up to us Andi spoke to the man.

“Hi Bill.” Andi said.

In a flash I knew that this was the optically obsessed guy she had dated before she went with me.  She had not told me that he wore myodiscs though.

He peered at her through his strong myodiscs and then exclaimed. “Andi!”

Andi introduced me to Bill, and Bill introduced us to his wife “Mouse.”  She did look like a timid but overweight little mouse and I figured that was where she got her nickname. But we all went to the food court for something to eat and I found out that she had been the girlfriend of a chap who was in a biker gang and the gang had called her Mouse because she was quite tiny at the time. No one in the gang had realized that her eyesight was extremely poor, and she didn’t stop wearing contact lenses until after she started going out with Bill.

Mouse now had a prescription that was more than double Andi’s -18.50D.  The lenses in her glasses were very thick for a double myodisc lens and I asked her if she wouldn’t mind telling me what her prescription was. She told me that the glasses she was presently wearing were -39.00D x -6.50D x 130 for her right eye and -38.50 x -6.00 x 30 for her left eye but she felt she needed a stronger prescription. Unfortunately with such a strong prescription she was only corrected to around 20/70 or so and was on disability because of her poor vision.

Bill confessed to Andi that he had gone to Mexico and had lens implants to enable him to wear the -25D myodiscs he was now wearing. He still had a visual acuity of 20/30 and was quite able to work to support the two of them. Bill asked Andi a number of questions about her glasses and was quite surprised that she had ended up with a prescription of -18.50D.

I didn’t feel that I had any desire to stay in contact with Bill and Mouse, but Andi dutifully took down their address and phone number and they wrote down ours.

That day, as we were leaving the mall I found myself singing “She’s so fine my minus nine.”  Andi asked me what I had just been singing and I then changed it back to the correct words of that Beach Boys song – She’s so fine my 409.

‘No Drew, that’s not what you said at first. What did you really sing?” Andi asked.

“She’s so fine my minus nine.” I said.

“What do you mean by that?” Andi asked.

“When I first met you that was what your glasses prescription was. I fell in love with a girl who was a minus nine and even though your prescription is now more than twice that I still think of you as you were when we first met.” I said.
