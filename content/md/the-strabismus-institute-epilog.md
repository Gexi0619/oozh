This concludes my story "The Strabismus Institute".  I hope you found it at least readable and enjoyable.  Unfortunately, The Strabismus Institute is a dream (I think) and many of the tests and devices are figments of my imagination.  However, 3-D printers are real and becoming inexpensive enough that you may have one before long.  I think if the polymers and techniques could be perfected, they could potentially make opthalmic lenses and revolutionize the optical industry.  So far, I have only seen results using powered metal or plastics that yield items that are not transparent and certainly not of optical quality, but who knows what is happening in the labs or what tomorrow holds.  If this triggers any ideas, please include me in the patent application.

The story wound up being longer than I originally intended and I want to thank Specs4ever for his excellent advice.  Right now, I don't have any ideas for another story, but I would appreciate any comments, pro or con, about the story and about The Strabismus Institute.
