Now, I am sure,I will never, wear contact lenses again.

I was very fortunate, that after graduating, I became employed, to work at a factory sales office.
Its a great job, and I like the people I work with .
After having been promoted, I now am, the private secretary, to the sales manager .
My present boss, retired this past week, and I was told, a new manager, will arrive on Tuesday.
I wonder, what he is going to be like, to work with?

On Tuesday morning, I spend extra time, to make myself look, as good as possible, 
I was happy with my hair and make up, wore my new pantsuit, heels, and contact lenses.
When I came down for breakfast, all dressed up, my mother asked me, why I did not wear my glasses?
To day, I am wearing my contact lenses, because I cannot see very much, without wearing my glasses, 
or contact lenses, and I have to meet the new sales manager.
Don’t worry, I have my glasses with me, in my purse., if I need them.

I was wondering, what the new sales manager would be like, I had no idea, if he was a young or an older person.
Being a little anxious, about my new sales manager coming, I did not get much work done.

It was almost the middle of the morning, when the general manager, walked in to my office, to introduce me,
to a most gorgeous looking man, about six feet tall, about my age, wearing glasses, and a big smile on his face.
I instantly, became wet in between my legs, just looking at him, and knowing, that I have to work with him.

Cathy, meet Jim Smith, our new sales manager.
I would appreciate it, if you could find the time, to show Jim around, and make him feel at home.
He has to find an apartment, and I would appreciate your help, to get him settled.
Jim, is not married, and he might need some female advice.
Yes, it will be a pleasure, I will look after him.
Not married, well I will try to get him settled.

After going over some information, and figures about our present sales, Jim asked me to go, and have lunch with him.
Before getting ready to go, I stopped at the ladies room, to pleasure myself, and powder my nose.
Working ,with a beautiful male species, like Jim, is very sexy.
I would like nothing better, then a change, to be his girlfriend, so I make sure I look my best.

While we were eating our lunch, for some reason, my contact lenses, started to give me trouble.
My eyes started to tear.
Jim, noticed my discomfort, and asked me what was wrong?
I, hesitantly told him, that I had trouble with my contact lenses.
Well, do you have your glasses handy?
Yes, they are in my purse.
Well, put your glasses on, I like the looks, of women and men, who wear glasses.
Now, I feel much better, he likes the looks, of people who wear glasses.
When I came back, after a visit to the ladies room, and now wearing my glasses.
Jim looked at me, you look fantastic wearing glasses,
Looking at your lenses, I notice, that you are myopic.
Yes, I am, I started to wear glasses, when I was in grade three, and my prescription, increased after each eye exam.
My present prescription, is – 6.50, but has stabilized.
You sure have me beat, my prescription, is only, in the -3.00 range.
Now knowing, he likes glasses, makes me feel so much better, now I might have better chance, to become his girlfriend.

We went apartment hunting, and we found Jim, a place he liked.
After buying some furniture and a bed, we went back to the office.
When we came back at the office, Jim thanked me for helping him, 
and told me, he is looking forward, to working with me.




All the single girls, who work in the office, are talking about the handsome man, that I work with.
They are jealous.

About three weeks later, Jim told me his close friend, was soon, coming for a visit.
He is in the optical business, and sells eyeglasses frames, to optical stores, 
and he only, sells some some very famous imported brands.
I am sure, you will like him, when you see him, I think, he is the best looking, glasses wearing man,
I have ever seen. 

During the next few weeks, everything went very smooth.
Jim and I work well together, and we make a great team.
Jim is always a gentleman, and treats me like a lady.

At night in bed, I fantasize about him, while I pleasure myself.
I am starting to wonder, why he never asked me for a date, perhaps, he figures, 
management and staff, should not be too friendly.
I know, he likes my glasses wearing look. well perhaps one of these days, I might get a surprise, I hope so.
Jim, walked around with a smile on his face, when he told me that his friend was coming for a visit,
Brian, is returning from a trip to Europe, where he has visited a number, of optical places, 
that make the latest, high style eyeglasses frames. 
He is very happy, about some of the new connections, he has made,
and the new types of glasses frames, he can now sell .
I certainly would like to meet Brian, and see, all those high fashion glasses.

When Brian, came to the office, I had to agree with Jim, that Brian, was a very handsome man.
I had never seen a better looking man, he was wearing, a very nice looking pair of glasses,
of a style, that I had never seen before.
His myopic prescription, looked to be about the same as my own.
Brian, congratulated me, on my nice glasses wearing look, and asked me, if I would be interested,
to model some glasses for him, so he could get, some good photos for advertising, 
he thinks, I will be a good model.
I asked Jim, if I was allowed to do that.
Yes, you can model for Brian, he will take the photos, on your days off.
Before Brian left, he asked me, for my glasses prescription. 

The following weekend, Brian wanted me to come to Jim’s apartment, for a picture shoot.
When I arrived at the apartment, Brian handed me a pair, of the most beautiful glasses, I had ever seen.
After I put the glasses on, I had a chance, to look at myself wearing the glasses.
I realized, I never before, had looked this good, wearing glasses.
Brian took pictures, of me wearing three different frames, all with my current prescription,
and when finished told me, I could keep the glasses.
What a great way to be paid, for so little work.
When I was ready to go home, and went to say good bye, 
I walked into the kitchen, where I knew they were.
I could not believe my eyes, when I saw, Jim and Brian, kissing each other,
Now I realize, why Jim, had never touched me, he is gay.

I said my goodbye’s . and went home.
Now, I need some good luck, and meet a guy, who likes my glasses look. 
With all the nice new glasses, that I now have to wear, I am sure, 
that I will not wear, my contact lenses again.

Today a new guy started to work in our office. he is a member of the management team.
All the girls in the office are talking about him, how handsome and good looking he is.
He is tall, well build, nice hair, well dressed , and what I like about him , he wears glasses.
I love the looks of a man wearing glasses, they look so handsome.
Well, I just have to be patient, and hope, he will notice me sometime..

I will not wear contact lenses again.
