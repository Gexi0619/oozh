A Crush On The Teacher:                                       

My first teaching assignment after I graduated was in a grade 7 class at a junior high school in an older section of the city.  As a white male, I was certainly in the minority; however I don’t think that any one ethnic group in the area really had a majority. There were Asians, African American’s, Hispanic’s and Whites, along with a smattering of people from the Islamic countries. So all in all it was a pretty mixed bag.  One thing I did notice that seemed unusual to me was that there truly seemed to be integration in this school.  No one race had seemed to set themselves up as the dominant force and that was, in my opinion, wonderful.

However, that didn’t mean that all was smooth sailing in my classroom. I still had the usual troublemakers, trying to test my stamina and resolve to maintain control.  I had a pretty good idea what I had gotten myself into, so I clamped down firmly, but fairly, and after the kids realized that I was not going to be pushed around I was able to get down to the basic task of educating this group of kids that were only around 10 years younger than I was.

I am an optically obsessed person.  Although I do not wear glasses myself I have a real fascination for those people who do.  And I had chosen the teaching profession as a career because I felt that I was more likely to run into a large number of glasses wearers. No, I was not interested in students, other than as an observer, and I felt that there was a pretty good chance that there would be a few female teachers that wore glasses.

I had chosen the first year of junior high as my starting point.  By the time the young ladies reached this grade they were into puberty, which generally started in grade 6 when they were around 12 years old.  With puberty comes a number of changes in their body and growth spurts are quite normal. This is often when the eyeball grows a little too long, and myopia results.  After looking over my first class of 13 year olds I was not disappointed.  Out of a class of 32 there were 9 girls and 3 boys who wore glasses. One of the boys and 2 of the girls wore fairly strong plus lenses. The other boy and 8 girls wore minus glasses that ranged in strength from about -1.50D up to around -10D.

One of the girls who had a prescription around -10D was an African American.  She was a tad heavy for her height, and I suspected that if she didn’t watch it she could be quite heavy as she grew older.  Her name was Lakeesha, and I couldn’t help but wonder what the heck that name meant.  There were a lot of strange names from the African American community, and I sometimes wondered if parents chose these names just to be different, or if the names really had some meaning.  Lakeesha was an intelligent young lady, and it was a pleasure to have her in my classroom. After watching her for a while though I could tell that her glasses were not quite strong enough for her, and that she would probably require new glasses before the end of the year.

The other girl who had a prescription in the same range was a tall skinny white girl. Patty had not filled out, and had virtually no chest.  However, watching her from the rear was a pleasure, as she had long legs that went up into a nice skinny butt that fitted her tight jeans perfectly.  Patty was a little more of a problem than Lakeesha was, because she tended to be a bit more disruptive, and she ended up having to stay after class about once a week.

Except for Sonja, who was a little short at about 5’3”, well endowed extremely attractive Hispanic girl, everyone else had fairly low prescriptions. Sonja was quiet, and a good student, and wore wire framed glasses with oval lenses that were in the range of -8D. She never gave me any trouble during the year, and Sonja ended up leaving my class as the only honor student.  The only thing I noticed about Sonja was that she always brought everything very close to her eyes to read and I suspected that Sonja would end up with a much higher prescription if she went on to graduate from University.

That first year of teaching was also my most memorable year.  I spent a lot of time setting up my lesson plans, and didn’t have much spare time for dating.  And much to my dismay there were no unattached female teachers on staff that wore glasses with a decent minus prescription. But I enjoyed my job, and my group of students went pretty easy on me that year.  I did end up sending notes home to both Lakeesha and Sonja’s parents suggesting that their daughters might need new prescriptions, and it was quite pleasurable for me to see them both end up with new, stronger glasses.

For my second year of teaching I was a little disappointed that my new crop of students had not brought me any decent replacement high myopes.  There were 2 more students that wore glasses than there had been the previous year, but out of 14 glasses wearers there wasn’t a one who was over -6D.  And even though I had a few that got new glasses during the year I still ended up with my highest student being the same -6D girl.

The years gradually blended into one another. Once in a while I would end up with a really myopic young lady to watch for the entire year, but for the most part I was stuck on a never ending treadmill of low myopes.  Even my colleagues didn’t help out, as there were still no unattached reasonably highly myopic females for me.  I had a lot more spare time available to me, because I now had 10 years of lesson plans behind me, and I could just modify the previous year’s lessons a little bit.  But even though I had more spare time, I wasn’t able to find myself a myopic lady to date.

I hadn’t kept up with any of my students, so it was a bit of a surprise when I purchased my house and went to the lawyer’s office to find that Lakeesha was my paralegal who was handling the transaction.  She had gotten a little heavier, but she still looked very attractive. And her glasses had increased in strength considerably.  They were not myodiscs, but you could see that the outer edges of her lenses had been cut down, and there was a bit of a myodisc effect because the circle where the part of the lens that had the power ended before it reached the edge of the frame. Also, the fronts of her glasses were now dished in quite a bit. She had a picture of herself; a man I assumed was her husband, and 2 girls on her desk.  The children, who looked to be about 2 and 3, were very cute.  The man also wore glasses and looked to be familiar, but I couldn’t place him.

“It has been a while Mr. Jones.  How have you been?” Lakeesha asked.

"I have been doing well Lakeesha. I am still teaching grade 7 at your old school, and I still enjoy it. I plan to be there for a while longer so that is why I am finally buying a house.  And you look to be doing well yourself, with a nice family.” I replied.

“That is only because Juan is a really good man.  Do you remember Sonja’s older brother Juan Hernandez?” Lakeesha asked.

“That is why he looked familiar.  He was in grade 9 when you were in my class. So you married him then.” I stated.

“I was a little stupid. I quit school when I was 18, and got pregnant by Juan.  Our oldest is 5 now, and is in kindergarten. Then almost 2 years later we had our second daughter and she is 3.  But then Jaun and Sonja helped me go back to school and I became a paralegal, so now I have a good job.” Lakeesha told me.

“You look good.  I see that your glasses have gotten a lot stronger though.” I said.

“They got a lot stronger before I quit school, but then when I had the kids my eyes got really bad.  And I think they are still getting worse.” Lakeesha said.

“That will stop someday. So you see Sonja frequently then I assume. How is she doing?” I asked.

“Sonja just finished university, and she is going on to law school next year. She is working here for the summer.  I will give her a call and you can see for yourself how she is doing.” Lakesha said.

Sonja came down to the room we were using after Lakeesha called her. When she walked in the door she almost took my breath away. She was absolutely gorgeous. Her glasses had also gotten a lot stronger, but they were still a bit weaker than Lakeesha’s. I estimated that Sonja had a prescription of around -18D or so, while Lakeesha had to be somewhere around -23D.  We all chatted for a few minutes, and I finished signing the papers that Lakeesha had ready for me to sign. As we finished I asked Lakeesha and Sonja if they would have lunch with me.  Lakeesha declined, but Sonja shyly accepted, so we headed off for a nearby restaurant.  We enjoyed a friendly meal, and we sat there drinking our coffee and chatting.  I learned that Sonja really liked being around her two nieces, and that she was not dating anyone

“I was always fond of you as a student Sonja.  But I never considered the possibility that we would meet again later in life.  Would you consider it to be inappropriate if I were to ask you if you would accompany me to the opening of the new theater this Saturday?” I asked.

“You are no longer my teacher. Why would it be inappropriate?” Sonja asked.

‘You were a student of mine, and I am around 10 years older than you are.  But if you are fine with that, I would love to take you.” I replied.

“I would love to go with you.  I had a big crush on you when you were my teacher.” Sonja said as she blushed.

I walked Sonja back to work, and we arranged for me to pick her up at Lakeesha and Juan’s place Saturday night.  That night when I returned to my apartment I finally felt that my life had just come together, and the future was going to be very good.
