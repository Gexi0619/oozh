The examiner was right, we need to wear glasses. 


Amber and Janice, have been friends since they started high school.
Both of them, are real good looking girls, have a beautiful head of hair, and nice curvy figures, almost perfect facial features, and are experts, applying just the right amount of make up.
They consider themselves the nicest looking girls in he school.
Both are good students, but are not very popular, because of their looks, and attitude, they think a lot of girls are jealous.
They both have a date once and a while, but there are not many boys, who are good enough.
When you are looking for looking for perfection, if there is such a thing., it is hard to find.
According to them, a person wearing glasses, is out, they hate the looks of glasses.
At school both Amber and Janice, like to sit near the front of the classroom, so they do not have to look at the back of poor hairdo's, of other girls, sitting in front of them.
Both Amber and Janice, can't wait until they have finished high school, so that hey can get their drivers license, their parents promised them a car after graduating, and they would have all of the summer to get their drivers license, 




During their last year in high school, a new student started in their class.
Rachel is a beauty, a beautiful head of natural blonde hair, and a face and body to make heads turn.
All the boys are looking at her and wonder who might be the lucky guy, to get a chance to take her out for a date.
Of course, Amber and Janice, made sure that Rachel , feels at home, birds of a feather flock together., and they soon were friends.
As usual the girls visited each others place regular, and loved to go shopping at the mall., or go to see a movie.
Lately both Amber and Janice, when they go and see a movie, prefer to sit past the middle closer to the front
That is where they now like to sit, they both know, why they like to sit there, because when sitting there, the picture looks almost perfect.
Rachel likes to sit further back, and she mentioned that, but gave in and sat with Amber and Janice. .


The next time they were at the mall, and the girls were window shopping, Rachel. stopped at the optical store window, where there was a display of new frames, and Rachel mentioned that she sure liked those frames, that they were very stylish.
Janice and Amber, did not like them , and told Rachel, they did not like the looks of glasses, on any person.
Rachel just smiled, and did not say anything, one of these days she would surprise them.


When she came home, Rachel was thinking about Amber and Janice comments about glasses, 
and how old fashioned they were, to condeming , more or less, every person who needed to wear glasses. 
She wondered what the reaction would be, if either one of the girls were told they needed to wear glasses.
They might be closer then they realize, about being told, having to wear glasses, they always sit in the front seats in class, sit almost in the front of the theatre, to watch a movie ,this is going to be interesting, because I am sure, they both are low myopic.
Now I wonder what they are going to say, when they find out, that I am myopic, and wear - 7.50 lenses, in either my glasses which I wear at home, or my contacts that I wear to school and during the day. 
I will find out next Saturday, when my new glasses are ready.
When I meet them, I will be wearing my glasses, and have them come with me, into the optical store, when I pick up my new glasses.,
Then I am sure curiosity will take over, and they will be trying some frames, or I will encourage them 
to try some of the frames , to have some idea, what they would look like, wearing glasses.
I am really looking forward to next week end, it is going to be fun.


Well there was a lot of anger before the weekend,
On Friday, both Amber and Janice went to get their beginners license, at the office of the department of motor vehicles.
When they had to take the vision test, both girls failed the test, and were told to come back, when they were wearing glasses.
Both were sure they had perfect vision, and that the person, who did the vision test was wrong, and they decided they were going back, and do the vision test again, making sure another person would do the test
When they went back to the license office, a nice elderly lady, gave them a big smile, and told them,
she would do the test again.
Both girls were sure they would pass the vision test this time. 
After the test, the lady told them, she was sorry, but their vision was not good enough to drive., and to come back when they were wearing their glasses.
Both Amber and Janice were fuming, and that night phoned Rachel, to tell her all about it.
Rachel , was all smiles after the phone call, and suggested she had some business at the mall, would they like to come?
They agreed, and Rachel would come and get them.


Rachel wearing her glasses, drove to Amber and Janice place, and blew the horn.
Amber was the first one to get into the car, and all she could say was, Rachel. you wear glasses?
then Janice came, Rachel. you wear glasses, poor you, I feel sorry for you. 
Rachel started to laugh, girls, I have been wearing glasses since grade 3, I kind of like wearing glasses, 
you can see properly, and, with the different frames available, you can change your looks, and if you don't want to not to wear your glasses, you can wear contact lenses, which I have done lately.
Both Amber and Janice had a good look at Rachel, and realized she still looked very nice, wearing glasses.
Perhaps wearing glasses was not a bad as they had thought.
Then the girls asked where are we going?
We are going to the optical store to pick up my new glasses. 
Rachel, what are we going to do, to get our drivers license?
Get your eyes examined and wear glasses if you have to, it is not all that bad, come with me into the optical store and try some frames, to see what you will look like wearing glasses, you might be surprised, how good you can look wearing glasses. 


When in the optical store , it did not take long for Rachel, to get her new glasses, she looked fantastic, and was very happy, then she suggested to the optometrist, to assist Amber and Janice, as they both were needing glasses, to find a suitable frame. 
At first both Amber and Janice, were almost scared to try a frame, until the optometrist, asked them to sit down at a little table, with a big mirror, and brought them some frames to try, and look at themselves.
The optician, knew what she was doing, and soon both girls could not believe how good they could look, wearing glasses, and started to feel better about having to wear glasses.
The optician told them that if they wanted an eye exam, being early in the morning, she might be able to work them in.
Amber looked at Janice, I am going to get an eye exam, I have my health card with me , and I really like the one frame that I tried.
Janice as usual agreed, and soon both girls went in for their eye exam.


As was expected both girls were prescribed glasses, and told to wear the glasses full time, and that their eyes were to dry for contact lenses, .
Amber's prescription was OD -1.75, OS -2.00, Janice prescription was almost identical except her right eye was worse then her left .
The optician looked after them for measurements, and the frames that they had selected.
Both Amber and Janice were stunned, not even 11 O'clock in the morning , and they were told their glasses would be ready in about an hour.
Rachel suggested they go to the food court, wait there ,and have some refreshments.
Now both Amber and Janice, could not wait for their glasses to be ready, wondering how they would look wearing glasses, and what their parents would say, when they see them wearing glasses.




Rachel thought what a wonderful day, everything turned out the way she had expected.
The new glasses were ready, and both girls could not believe, that the glasses improved their vision that much , and looked around wearing and not wearing the glasses, and had not realized their vision had been that bad.
They were also very surprised how good they looked wearing glasses , and liked the way they looked.
Now they realized, when they failed the vision test for their driving license , the examiner was right, they needed to wear glasses.
