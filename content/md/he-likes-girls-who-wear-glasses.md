He likes girls who wear glasses.


My twin sister Jenny and I, share a nice big bedroom, with a large window.
Looking out, we can see, some church steeples, and the water tower.
On top of the water tower is a red light, and the name of our town, which we can only see,
after all the trees are bare, in the late fall. 
The red light looks like the top of a Christmas tree, and makes us look forward to the holiday season.


My dad, likes birds, and has a large feeder, and every time I look,,
is always full of birds feeding, and the squirrels, doing all their acrobatics, 
trying to get into the bird feeder, we all love watching the performance.


Jenny and I are very close, we usually, have the same taste, and we both, like participating in sports,
and other school activities.
Since grade one, I have a close friend, Amber, is a pleasant girl, we get along well, and often visit each other.
Jenny’s girlfriend, Wanda, is a kind of a Tomboy, and lots of fun, we always have a great time, when we all. get together.


My mother, wears her glasses all the time, my dad only wears his glasses, when he is reading.
We all, have our regular eye exams, the last one a little over a year ago. 
Both of us, have 20/20, vision.


We are now in grade six, at school, and our bodies, going through puberty, and are now developing nicely, 
which makes us feel, like young women.
Lately, we have grown, a lot taller, so now, we have some new clothes, in our wardrobe. 
We both do our best, to look as attractive as we can.


Amber, came to school wearing glasses.
She looks very nice, and gown up, wearing a nice, colour full glasses frame.
I of course, had to try her glasses, but could not see very well, everything in the distance, did not look very clear.
When, I had a change, to look at myself, wearing the glasses, was surprised, how good I looked, wearing the glasses,
Now, I don’t know, would I like to wear glasses? I sure love the way I look, wearing glasses.
Later in the day, I mentioned to Jenny, how I had tried, Amber’s new glasses. 
Does she like wearing glasses?
Yes, Amber told me, that she now loves, wearing glasses, that the glasses, are very comfortable to wear,
and she loves her improved vision, and her glasses wearing look.
Yes, I have noticed, a lot more of the students at school,, are wearing glasses now, what is going on?
I understand, that the majority of them, have trouble, with clear distant vision, like reading, 
and what is written on the white board.
Well, I guess we are lucky, that our vision is perfect, and we do not have to wear glasses.


Time flies by, but after the summer break, we did not, as usual, have our regular eye exam, 
The building, where the eye doctor is located, had a fire, and all appointments, are cancelled.
We will be informed, when, the doctor is ready, to do the eye exams again.


Lately, it seems, that my distant vision, is not as good, as it has been. 
In school, I am now sitting in the second row, and find the writing on the white board, a little fuzzy.


Now, after all the leaves have fallen of the trees, and looking at the light on top of the water tower,
I can hardly see the tower and the red light, it looks all fuzzy, and when looking at our back yard,
I noticed that even the bird feeder looks fuzzy..
When, I mentioned to Jenny, that my vision was not as good anymore, and that I was not able to see the light, 
on the water tower. 
They need to replace the light bulbs, then you will be able to see it .
No, I don’t think so, when I look at our bird feeder, it also looks fuzzy, and not very clear.
I think, you would like to wear glasses, like your friend Amber, my vision is perfect.
I am sure, you are lying, I have seen you squint, you just hate the thoughts, of having to wear glasses.


To day, when I went to see Amber, she is wearing new glasses. 
Amber, you look fantastic, you look so nice, I love the look of your new glasses.
Yes, I like them, I had to get new glasses, at my eye exam, the prescription has now increased, my new prescription,
reads – 2.50. 
I like wearing my new, stronger prescription glasses, I can see a fly a mile away.
Amber, I am sure, that my vision, is getting worse, and I mentioned to her, the trouble I was having,
trying to see the water tower light, and even the bird feeder., in our backyard, that everything is looking fuzzy.
Cindy, it sounds to me, you to, are myopic, and need to wear glasses.
I think you are right, but the appointments, for our eye exams, are on hold, due to the fire in that building.


My mother, to day, mentioned to Jenny and me, that she had noticed, both of us, seem to be squinting more often, 
did we notice a change in our vision?
Jenny, said, mom, there is nothing to worry about, we can see just fine.
I know she is wrong, but I did not say anything.


The next time, I was at Amber’s place, I mentioned to her, about what my mother, had told us, 
but that Jenny had assured her, that our vision is still perfect. 
I know, I will have to wait, to find out, about my vision, until we have our eye exam, I think, I need to wear glasses.
Cindy, I think you are right, that you are myopic, and will have to wear glasses.
I think we can find out , if you need to wear glasses.
Why don’t you, try my old glasses again, I am sure that now, you will be able to see properly wearing the glasses.
Yes, I remember, that I could not see to well, the last time I tried, wearing the glasses. 
I sure would like to try the glasses again, then I know for sure, if I am myopic.
Amber handed me her old glasses, and after I put them on, and looked around, realized, 
that I am now myopic, and need to wear glasses.
What an unbelievable pleasure, to be able, to see everything in the distance, so nice and clear., and well defined.
I could not resist, to have another look at myself, in the mirror on Amber’s dresser.
Yes, I sure like my glasses look, and at the same time, being able to see everything, so nice and clear.
Now, I cannot wait, till I get my own glasses.




Well, how is your vision now, wearing the glasses?
Fantastic, I can see everything, so nice and clear now, I love it.
Well, you look very nice, wearing glasses, thank you, yes, I like the way I look, wearing glasses.
If you want to keep on wearing the glasses, you can use them, till you get your own.
Thank you, I would like that, then I can wear the glasses, whenever I want to wear them, till I get my own glasses. 
I asked Amber, if I could try wearing her new glasses.
After I put her new glasses on, was really surprised, how well I could see, is my vision that bad?
Amber was surprised I could see so well, wearing her new glasses, Cindy, you sure need to wear glasses. 


I wore Amber’s old glasses going home. and when looking around, really enjoyed my improved vision.
The glasses are so comfortable to wear, that I forgot, I was wearing the glasses, when I entered our house. 
My mother wanted to know, where I got the glasses. and why I thought, I needed to wear glasses ?
Then, I told her about not being able, to see the water tower clearly, and that when looking out of our bedroom window,, 
even the bird feeder in the backyard, was looking fuzzy, and that, when I tried Amber’s new glasses, I could see well.
I am sorry, that we missed our last appointment, because of the fire, I will talk to your dad, to see what he suggests.
You look very nice, wearing glasses, and if they make you see better, and want to, you might as well, keep wearing the glasses.
So now, I am wearing glasses, and I love it.


When Jenny, saw me wearing the glasses, she pretty near, had a fit.
What are you doing wearing glasses?
You know, I hate wearing glasses, and don’t want have to wear glasses, my vision is fine.
I know, that is not true, I have noticed, you to, are having trouble seeing objects in the distance, you told me so.
Would you like to try, wearing the glasses ? You might be surprised.
Reluctantly, she put the glasses on, and looked around.
I asked her, to look at the water tower.
Can you see, the tower now?
I am afraid to say so, but yes, wearing the glasses, sure makes everything I look at, nice and clear and well defined, 
but I do not want to wear glasses, I don’t like the looks of them., and I can see just fine, without wearing glasses.
Why don’t you, have a good look at yourself in the mirror, you might change your mind.
Jenny, if you like it, or not, we know, that both of us are myopic now, and will have to wear glasses to see properly.




To day, coming home from school, my mother told us, we were scheduled for an eye exam, next week.
I am all excited, but my sister is not, she hates the idea, of having to wear glasses, but knows, 
she needs to wear them to see properly.




I am now, so used to wearing glasses, that I wore them to our eye exam. 
The optician took my glasses, to check the prescription, before she did the preliminary exam.
After my exam was finished, the doctor told me that my prescription, had increased, 
and that there was a slight adjustment for my astigmatism.
My prescription read O.D. -1.75, O.S, -2 00.
Jenny’s prescription was almost the same, as mine, and no both of us need to wear glasses.
I wear my glasses, Jenny does not, and she is not going to wear glasses




We now go to high school.
Jenny and I, and had another eye exam, my prescription went up, and I now wear – 3.25 prescription glasses.
My mother has given up , to try to get Jenny, to wear her glasses.




We had a school dance, and I had a great time dancing all night long, Jenny was not to happy, she is jealous, 
I was asked more times to dance, then she was,
Driver education is next. I reminded Jenny, that she is going to need to wear her glasses, but she is not going to.
After we filled out the questions about the rules of the road, we had our vision test.
I passed , both tests, and now have my beginners license.
Because Jenny refused to wear her glasses, failed the vision test, and now has to try again when she wears her glasses.
Dad, had to take her to the license office, to do her vision test, wearing her glasses.




Now our driver education is in a car, with one student driving, the instructor, would look at our license, 
to check for conditions, like having to wear glasses.
Jenny, did wear her glasses, she put them on when she got into the car, and took them off, when the drive was finished.,
so as few people as possible knew she was wearing glasses.
I don’t know why she is so stubborn, more then half of the students in the school, are wearing glasses now.


To day, Jenny mentioned to me that she has a crush, on Geoff, one of our, football players.
A good looking guy, who is very popular with the girls.
To day, Geoff, asked me, if Jenny, wore glasses, he likes her, and had noticed that she always squints,
Since you are her twin sister, and wears glasses, why does she not wear glasses.
Because, she hates wearing her glasses.
That gives me an idea, I am going to ask her to go on a date with me.


Geoff, asked Jenny for a date, and she is all excited.
When Geoff, came to get her , she was really surprised to see him wearing glasses.
I did not know you wore glasses.
Yes I do, I wear contact lenses when at school, so I can practice with the football team, after classes..
Would you like to go and see a movie? 
Yes, that sounds great.
When they were in the theatre, Geoff guide Jenny to seats, near the rear of the theatre.
After the movie had started, Geoff knew right away, Jenny had a vision problem.
Jenny, are you all right, you seem to have a problem.
Yes, I have, I should be wearing my glasses.
Why don’t you?
I forgot to bring them.
I expected, you would be wearing glasses, looking at your sister’s glasses. 
If you need to wear glasses wear them, a lot of guys like the looks of girls wearing glasses.
We might as well go home, and we will try again when you wear your glasses.
The next day, Jenny, wore her glasses going to school, and she now wears her glasses all the time.
Geoff sure knew, how to get Jenny to wear her glasses, and they had many more dates.,
because, because Geoff likes girls who wear glasses.
