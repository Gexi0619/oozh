Part 6 some xxx


As the girls walked to the station many heads were turning to look at these 2 beautiful young lady's with thick glasses and proudly wearing their hearing aids
Until this term the girls had not relished that they only lived a few miles away from each other.
Margrets parents were going to be away for the first week of the holidays so Jill was coming to stay with her.
When they boarded the train they looked at there tickets,coach 9 compartment 5 seats 2 and 3 it was one of the older types of carriage with compartments.As they took their seats,They seemed to have the compartment to themselves
It was the first time the 2 girls had been alone together.
Jill shyly moved her hand and put it on top of Margaret's,wondering if Margeret would pull hers away,but no Margret lifted her hand and gently grasped it.
They both turned and slowly gazed into each other's eyes Jill's large eyes excited Margret,and there was something about her own eyes that made Jill's heart beat faster.
Who was going to be first to have the courage to place the first kiss on the others lips.
Jill got up and slid the compartment door closed and pulled the blinds down,as she sat down she said” shall we exchange glasses and take selfies I would love to see what  I look like with tiny eyes”.
“O yes please I love your large eyes”
Both girls seemed to get very excited as they changed glasses,neither could see anything, all was a complete blur,Jill made the first move, she pulled Margret towards her.
Having each other glasses on seem to intensify the passanant kissing.neither girl had ever been kissed like this before 
Both had Been kissed by a boy once or twice ,but nothing had given them this tingling feeling that was spreading down their body's,as their hands moved slowly down,the thought of pleasing each other intensified.
At that moment .they heard a voice in the corridor saying.
“Tickets please have your tickets ready.
In a blind panic they both pulled apart, and thumbled in their bags for the tickets
Neither girl having time to change their glasses as the guard clipped their tickets a voice said may I sit opposite you.
Both girls just sat there staring forward into a blurred world.
The lady started to say something to them but they just smiled at her and pointed to their hearing aids.
How were they going to see to find their way off the train.
Fortunately after an hour the lady got up and said  “goodbye I love your glasses they suit both of you so much,you have both chosen glasses that match your clothes”
As soon as the lady had left both girls started to giggle uncontrollably.
“I think we had better put our own glasses back on it will soon be our stop”
They both looked in the mirror and gasped Jill had smudges of Margaret's pink lipstick on her cheeks, and there were traces of red lipstick all over Jill's face.
They hugged each other and picked up their luggage 
Then they walked to the taxi rank holding each other hands and smiling 

As soon as they got into the house they reached for each other glasses,Jill now had tiny eyes, she wondered how big Margarets eyes must look,,but they both had entered this fantastic blurred world.were hands would take over from their eyes.
The week went so fast,half of the time had been spent in their blurred fantasy world.
When Margaret's parents arrived they were surprised to see their daughter wearing such thick glasses,”O you poor girl your eyes look so tiny we never realised how bad your eyesight was
It's ok mum I love my glasses and I'm deputy head girl now
“What are those large things behind your ears”
“It's my hearing aids mum, they help me a lots,I love the feeling of them behind my ears.
“George come here this moment look at your daughter she is deaf and newly blind now look at those thick glasses and huge hearing aids she's wearing
“She will never find a boy now and get married”
“It's ok mum I have someone special in my life now and they love my glasses and hearing aids,
“Well make sure you don't get pregnant “

“It's ok mum it can't happen”

As soon as Jill arrived home she was greeted by her excited sister.
“Wow your eyes look even bigger now ,will my eyes get like that,I hope so”
“Can I help you unpack”.
“Why have you got 2 pairs of school glasses”
“This pair is my new stronger prescription for when I start back,and the other pair is what I have been wearing this year”
“Can I have your old ones please”
Before Jill could reply her s
“O my god they are fabulous everything's is so much bigger and and clearer”
“I love them the lens are much thicker than the other you gave me”
“Why are you whispering Jill. Please speak louder I can't hear you”
Jill just smiled to herself.
At meal time Jill's sister kept asking everybody to repeat themselves.
Her Father started to get Angry with her,
“What is wrong with you girl are you going deaf like your sister”
“For goodness sake Jill give her one of your hearing aids”
“But dad the moulds won't fit her and I won't her as well”
Father insisted..
So Jill pushed the moulds into her sisters ears.As Jill turned them on her sister looked shocked.
“Everything is so loud now,I can even hear the clock in the other room.Why do I need to wear these now,I could hear ok when I wore the other glasses, but now even better with this hearing aid in”
As she started to eat her meal the hearing aid whistled  every time she opened her mouth to put food in.
“I told you they would not fit her”
Mum turned to Jill “why has your sister suddenly gone deaf”
“She hasn't suddenly gone deaf Mum, You let her keep wearing my old glasses,they had hearing aids built into the arm,that's why she has been able to hear so well.,When I got back to school I had to start wearing this type as the others were a special sample,Now because my hearing has got worse I wear  these bigger ones behind my ears”
“What can we do Mum I can see so much better in these glasses, but I can't manage  now without hearing aids”.
“If you take both pairs of glasses to the optical shop they might put these lens in your hearing aid glasses”
“BuI I can hear even better with Jill's hearing aids”
“Well you can't keep it,I need it back tonight”
“I'm going camping tomorrow with Margret my classmate”
That was a lie,but I missed her so much I went to my room and rung her.everything was quickly arranged.
Next morning Jill woke early and crept into her sister bedroom and retrieved  her hearing aid.
One hour later as she stepped off the train she saw Margret running towards her.,as they meet their arms instantly wrapped around each other,without looking around they started passionately kissing each other
Margret broke for air and gasped “we must rush to get the bus I have drawn some of my savings out and rented us a caravan,instead of camping,I hope that's ok”
As soon as they opened the caravan door Jill reached forward and slowly removed Margaret's glasses a few seconds later both girls had exchanged each other glasses.
They now entered their blurred fantasy world.
For the next 7 days they would keep each other's glasses on and enjoy the pleasures of their new found world.

To be continued.
