I am thinking of leaving this site 

Many years ago I had a serious illness which left me unable to read or write.
I still have many problems but with help I was able to get a teaching degree
I am retired now. 
Positive comments help, public criticism discourages.
I always talked to a student in private if I was not happy with their work.
I started posting  stories on this sight to help it grow
Since December my stories have had over 10,000 reads 
But a moderator has posted  today that he finds my writing irritating,I am therefore thinking about not posting any more 
Moderates can send private messages,which I am more than happy to receive 
Not all stories are to my liking, but I appreciate the time that as been spent writing them.
There are very few picture posted here 
Without stories this site would die.
