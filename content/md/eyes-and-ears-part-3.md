Eyes and Ears  part 3 

Time has pasted  very fast and as you might have guested  I hired Vanessa as my Nanny.this had proved to be a good decision.she worked very hard,the children liked her and my meal was always ready for me when I got home.
She was always happy and singing.

The business was doing.very well,I now kept 3 afternoons free for checking eyesight and hearing for the agency
But last week I was approached by the principle of a prestigious private girls boarding school.
The school nurse was worried about the amount of girls were coming to her with headaches and complaining of double vision.also many girls were missing lessons
So today I am at the school and in the nurse's office ,
First I wanted to know how long this had been a problem,was the problem manly in a particular age group,and had the girls had their eyes tested.
I had brought my test glasses and my traveling box of lens also a wall chart and a reading card.
The head girl arrived she had been given the responsibility of showing me around  the school.
After we had visited 2 classrooms I spotted the school refectory.
“Can we go in here and have a coke “I asked Jill 
 As soon as we sat down I said
“Where were all the white boards and computer monitors”.
Jill explained “that they had a new head of I T last year and and at the start of this New teaching year all white boards and large computer screens had been removed and now each student had a iPad or a iPhone”.
“Do you like it”
“Yes It's very  good that we have no notes to copy and no papers to hand in.
“I Have had a lot of headaches this year and felt dizzy.im not sleeping very well so if I miss a lesson it's not so bad I can catch up on my iPad all the lessons are there.
That was the problem it was the blue light from the iPad screens.
“Do you wear glasses”
“No why”
“If you come back to the nurses office with me now  I would like to test your eyes”
Jill was a little long sighted with a small amount of astigmatism.
“If I bring you a pair of glasses for you tomorrow would you wear them all the time for the rest of the week”.
Um “yes I suppose so if you think it will help”
I explained to the nurse what I thought the problem was the blue light from the iPads 
When I got back to my shop I went straight down to my lab
And selected the lens I needed
R +.50  .25 110  Add 1.00 Prism out 1 
L  +.75. .50  90. Add .100. Prism out 1
Executive bifocal lens with blue filter 
Jill had just arrived,I picked out 3 large blue frames for her to choose from,
“I like this pair best the colour matches my school uniform  “Jill said 
I gave her a note and a bottle of eye drops to give to the nurse,and told her to go to bed and not to open her iPad or iPhone for the rest of the day.

The next morning I met Jill in the nurse's room and fitted the new glasses on her and explains that distance might look a bit blurred at first,and she had to look down when reading or looking at her iPad.
After walking around and looking up and down I gave her my iPad to read.
“It's all so very clear and the iPad is not as bright and all the letters are bigger and sharper,how have you done that?”
The nurse had arranged for the 3 of us to go up to the principal's  office in the tower.
I explained to him what I thought the problem was and Jill was helping me for the rest of the week,
He looked very worried “ I have just spend over 1 million pounds on 500  iPads and new computer softwares and  programs and all the old computers had been sent to schools in Africa that we sponsor with a distant learning program.
“What are we to do I can't tell the board of directors that we have this problem
“Well if I am right then all the girls will need to wear glasses like Jill is wearing now”.
“What do you think Jill”
“Well Master I can see very much better with them and the colour matches our school uniform”.
As we left Jill smiled and said”I think he will get his bottle of whiskey out of that cupboard before we get down the bottom of the stairs haha”.
We accompeted Jill to her class and explained why Jill was now wearing glasses now.
Many hands shot up”please sir can we have a pair my headaches are so bad I can't sleep”the nurse looked shocked she knew some girls had a problem but not on this scale.

As arranged Jill arrived a 9 am on Saturday morning.
“How are your glasses”
“They are great all the headaches have gone and I'm sleeping a lot better,but things aren't as clear to read as they were when I first got them I had a little double vision before I went to bed”
It was clear that Jill's eyes had now relaxed and was used to the help the glasses gave her, so I re tested her eyes,her astigmatism had stayed the same,but I increased her distance to + 1.00 in both eyes and changed the add to +2.00 also as she said that she had some double vision I changed the Prism to 3 out in each eye 
I rang the principle and said I wanted to check Jill again in 2 weeks then if he agreed we would increase our trails to half of the girls in Jill's class.
“Yes anything you want to,just please sort this problem out”
2 Weeks later Jill arrived all smiles”I not had any headaches but when I very tiered I still see a little double .
I thought it was now time to talk again to the principle and suggest  that we have a office in the school and set it up as a testing room I would order new equipment.Jill looked excited 
“Please can I help you set it all up I'm very good at paperwork I could help with the records.Can you test my eyes again I think it's exciting you changing all the different lens that stop the headaches and  help me see better
“Mum said if I need to wear glasses all the time now not just at school she would pay for another pair”. 
My eyes turn into cash regesters I could see all the money signs flashing in front of me.
I agreed to test Jill's eyes again as I thought it would be the last time for a while,
“Can you make them a little stronger for me please if you not going to test them again this term.
After checking her eyes and giving it a lot of thought I increased her prescription 
R +2.00 .50  110 add 3.00 prism 5 out 
L  +2.25 .75.  90 add 3.00 prism  5 out
“If I make these up for you Jill the lens will have to be a lot thicker,how do you feel about that”.
“That's fine with me I'm the only girl not to have headaches and I'm top of the class now.
“I hope my lens will be the thickest haha”
Jill looked up “ who is that lady that had gone into your office”.
“That's Vanessa my nanny,the children are at school now so she works part time here now “
“What is that behind her ears”
“She has a hearing problem,they are hearing aids,they help her to hear better”.
“O maybe I will need them one day haha  the microphones the tuters use are very poor and we are always ask him to speak louder”
I told Jill I had arranged to meet the Master on Monday and I would bring her new glasses with me.
After Jill had gone I started to think about what she had said abut Vanasse hearing aids.and that we had a rep come in last month showing us a range of bone anchored hearing aid glasses.,so I rang him and asked if he had a large framed pair in navy blue and could he bring them tomorrow.
The next morning at 10am the rep arrived with a big smile on his face.
“I think this might be what you were asking for”
“Yes that's perfect,what will the cost be”.
“My boss said you can have them free of charge as part of our advertising campaign”
As Jill seemed to want thicker lens I decided to use larger blanks.and set the hearing aid on a low program.
Monday arrived and I had the meeting with the master,he had agreed to cover the cost of the equipment I needed and the use of 2 small adjoining rooms and glasses for 15 more girls
Jill was waiting for me 
“Have you got my new glasses please”
She looked very excited when I took the out of the case to show her.
“O they look fabulous,the lens are so much thicker,and I love the different arms they have this time,can I try them on please”.
“Wow they are perfect I can see even better now and my eyes look so much bigger,people will know I'm head girl now”.
“Will you come with me now to your class and help me select 15 more girls to have their eyes tested.
When we got to her class the teacher was just finishing  the first lesson,so we sat at the back of the class and waited,
Jill turn to me “have they fitted new microphone and loudspeakers in this room over the weekend,everything is much clearer and louder”
I said nothing.
The teacher then asked the class who would like to be the next 15 girls to get fitted with glasses,all the girls put their hands up and said me please me please sir 
Jill suggested we put all the names in a box and draw 15 out.
So we sat there and waited as the teacher started to call the names out.
“Have you got a tissue please I want to clean my glasses there is a mark on the front “
I gave Jill a tissue as she took her glasses off to clean them
“O why have the loudspeaker gone wrong again”
Then as she put her glasses back on “that's better they are working again”
She then took her glasses on and off, then she looked at the arms of her glasses.
“WOW am I wearing hearing aids now sir”
I explained that over the weekend end we had a hearing loop fitted in this class and as soon as the microphone was turned on the hearing aid in the glasses changed channels and feed the sound straight into her ears 
“Are all the girls going to be fitted with glasses like this sir”
“No we can't afford to do that I'm afraid they cost a lot but because you are help me we have arranged these for you.
“Could the other girls have hearing aids like Vanessa has” Jill asked 
“I suppose that's possible,I had not thought of that”
We went to find the rooms that we had been given.
I had brought a filling tray with a card system in it,and asked Jill if she would make a card out for each girl,then it would be her job to keep a record of the date and prescription.
“Can I make one for myself first,
After finding out what day and time Jill was free,it was decided that we would start on Wednesday at 1pm and work till 8pm with one hour break at 5 pm.
“Please sir before I go can I ask if it's possible that has head girl I always have the thickest lens in my glasses”.
“If that's what you want I will try my best,but if some body has very bad eyesight,then what can I do”
“I don't mind how thick you make mine I'm sure I get used to the stronger lens”.
