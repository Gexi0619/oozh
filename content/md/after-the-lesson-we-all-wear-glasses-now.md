After the lesson, we all wear glasses now.

My husband Jim and I,[ Nancy], and our son Matthew and daughter Kelley, just moved into a new house.
A nice quiet neighborhood close to a nice park and schools.
It did not take us long to meet some of our neighbors and for our children to make some new friends.
I was invited over for a coffee next door and met Ashley and her children Logan and Kim.
What a pleasant surprise that our children are all about the same age, and will be in the same grades at school after the summer break.
We are feeling better now about the move.

Another school year has started.
Kelley, who is now in grade 4, came home telling me about her new teacher, Miss James.
She is beautiful, has nice hair and wears glasses that sparkle, and I like her.
I asked Kim how she liked Miss James, she told me she hates her glasses.
We have 22 kids in our class, 12 girls and 10 boys.
And two of the girls and one boy wear glasses.

The following week when Kelley came home all excited, she told me her story.

Today Jenny came to school wearing glasses, she looked so pretty.
A couple of boys were not very nice to her and called her 4 eyes, and told her she must be blind. 
Jenny was very upset and told Miss James.
Miss James told her how nice she looked wearing glasses, and not to worry she was sure the boys would not tease her anymore.
When class started Miss James told us that the health lesson to day was all about vision.
She pointed out that all of us are about the same age, but some of us are taller, and some of us are shorter.
Vision is the same, our eyes grow and change, but not the same way for everybody.
Eyes are like cameras and sometimes the cameras need an adjustment to make a clear picture, and wearing glasses will be necessary to see properly.
That shows, it is nobody s fault that you have to wear glasses.
Then she explained to us that some people are long sighted, they have no trouble seeing far away, but have trouble seeing things close.
Other people are nearsighted and can see all things that are close but not faraway.
That is why people wear glasses to correct there vision, so they can see properly, that shows you that it is not very nice to tease a person because he or she has to wear glasses. 
Then she put a chart on the wall with letters, big ones on top and smaller when you read down.
She asked us to stand at a mark on the floor and then see how many lines of letters you could read.
If you cannot read all the lines, tell your parents that you should have an eye exam
Some of my friends could not read very far down, I got more than half way
Then she told us about the importance of an eye exam.
Mom can I have an eye exam?

I think I like to meet Miss James, and see what this vision business is all about.
The next day when classes were finished I met Miss James. 
I must agree with Kelley, she is a very attractive woman.
I told her how impressed Kelley was with her explanation about vision, and had asked for an eye exam.
After talking with Miss James, I realized I sure did not know very much about eyes and vision.
I had never realized that a person does not really know what perfect vision is, until they had an eye exam.
This gave me something to think about, and will have to discus with my husband.

That night I told my husband all about Kelley s story and talking to Miss James.
My husband after hearing the complete story, suggested that it might be a good idea for all of us to have our vision checked.
I am to make appointments for the children and myself, and my husband will try to get an appointment for his lunch hour.

The next day when I was having coffee with Ashley my neighbor, I asked her if Kim had told her about 
Miss James vision lecture.
No, she did not mention it to me.
So I told her the whole story about what Kelley had told me, and about me going to the school and meeting with Miss James.
We now have appointments for an eye exam, we want to be sure that all of us have proper vision.
Ashley wondered if that would be necessary, you should know when you can t see well, I am sure we all have perfect vision.

We have appointments for our eye exams Friday afternoon.
When we arrived at the optical store Matthew asked me why he was here, he did not need glasses.
I told him we all had to make sure our eyes are healthy and our vision is good.
While Kelley had her eye exam, Matthew and I looked at the frames on display.
I noticed that after Matthew had tried some of the frames and saw what he looked like wearing glasses 
seemed to like how he looked wearing glasses.
I did not say anything but tried some different frames myself, and asked Matthew how I looked.
Mom, you look very nice wearing glasses.
Then Kelley came out of the examination room and it was Matthew s turn.

Kelley came to me with a big smile on her face.
Mom I have to wear glasses, I want to look just as nice as Miss James.
So we looked and tried different frames,  Kelley loved a multi colored frame that looked very nice on he, so that is what we decided on.
While the optician looked after Kelley for the proper measurements, I picked out a frame that I liked in case I to needed to wear glasses.
Matthew came out of the examination room with a frown on his face.
Mom I have to wear glasses.
So I told him, that I thought he looked very handsome when he was trying some of the frames. 
You should select a frame that you like while I have my eye exam, I am sure Kelley will help you.

When I sat down for my eye exam, I asked the doctor about Kelley and Matthew.
Kelley is myopic and she will notice a big improvement in her vision wearing glasses.
Matthew is a little bit farsighted but has some astigmatism that needs to be corrected.
He should wear his glasses full time,  it will take him a little while to get used to his new vision.
Then it was my turn, my first eye exam.
I appreciated that the optometrist explained some of the procedures of the exam.
My biggest surprise came when I could not read the letters all the way down., 
After I heard some clicks I could read all the letters.
Then he asked me to read the letters again, and I had no trouble reading them, all the letters were nice and clear.
The optometrist told me that I was myopic and should wear glasses.
I was shocked all three of us now have to wear glasses, I had never expected that.
It took us a little while to get frames for all of us that we liked.
After the optician took all the measurements, she told us our glasses would be ready in the morning.
When we left the optical store I realized that it was close to supper time, so we picked up some pizza 
on the way home.
When we walked into the house could not believe our eyes, my husband was wearing glasses.
He told us that he had his eye exam at his lunch break and picked up his glasses on the way home.
We complimented him on his new look, sat down ate our pizza and told him all about our eye exams.

The next day all of us went to the optical store to pick up our glasses.
Kelley was first, she looked so cut wearing glasses, and when she looked around said, mom I can t believe how much better I can see now, and everything looks so nice and clear.
When I got my glasses and put them on I noticed what Kelley had told me, I could not believe the improvement in my vision.
Matthew looked very nice wearing his new glasses, and looked at us with a big smile on his face.
My husband told us he likes the new look of his glasses wearing family.

When Kim came to visit Kelley and saw her new glasses told her how nice she looked .
When she tried the glasses was surprised how she could see so much better, and when she looked at herself said I want to wear glasses, I will go home right now and tell my parents.

The following week when Kelley came home from school told me that two more girls were wearing glasses now and also two of the three of the boys who teased Jenny when she came to school wearing glasses.
Miss James lesson on vision was really good, because we all wear glasses now!
