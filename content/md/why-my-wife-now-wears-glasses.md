WHY MY WIFE NOW WEARS GLASSES 

I have been happily married for 7 years now,we were both 18 when we married.  
My wife has beautiful large blue eyes and perfect vision 

I suppose its natural after a while to look at other women on the train and in the street’ not that I was wanting to have an affair.

I began to notice how many attractive young women were now wearing glasses. When I was courting most girls that wore glasses, were rather plain or just not my type.

Each morning on my way to work I started counting the women wearing glasses and grading them 1 to 10

At lunch time I was sitting outside my local coffee shop.

Counting glasses wearers had become an obsession with me,I must have been counting out aloud.

A voice from the next table said.

“I thought that Blonde girl was worth a 10 plus”

 That is how my wife's looks started to change

He explained that he was an optician and how I could get my wife to need glasses,without her knowing my obsession.

It was summer coming and he could make me a pair of sunglasses with a small prescription.if she noticed and differences,then I was to say it's properly because things look different through the darker lens

The prescription was minus .50 in each eye with a one out prism.

It was a beautiful sunny weekend,so now was my chance to give her the new sunglasses.

“I have a suprise for you darling, I was in Boots the chemist yesterday buying things for or visit to the country this weekend, and I noticed they had offers sunglasses,so I bought you these, I know your other are old now”

“That was very thoughtful of you darling,they must have been very expensive,shall I try them on now”

“They look beautiful on you darling,I hope you like them”

“Yes I feel like one of those film stars that need glasses to see but they wear prescription sunglasses instead haha”

“Do you mind if I keep them on Darling,

I was lucky it was bright sunshine all weekend,so my wife wore the glasses all the time even when we were eating our Meals outside at the localrestaurant.

Monday morning came. It was bright and sunny,

Mary leaves for work before me I notice she put the sunglasses straight on before she left.

“I love the name on the side of my new sunglasses dear the girls in the office will be so jealous ha”

3 weeks later my friend rang and said he had the next pair of lens ready for me, and suggested I undid one of the screws in the glasses arms so it would fall out when she put them on,and I could bring them in to him in my lunch break.

The next morning.

“Darling can you help me i can't find the screw that's dropped out of my sunglasses, I need them for driving they rest my eyes from the bright sun”

“Don't worry darling I will drive us in and get them fixed in my lunch break”

I went straight to my optician friends shop.

I explained that she was wearing the sunglasses a lot now even for driving.

“That's all done I have increased them to -1 with a 2 out prism, let's see how she manages with them for the next month”

As soon as I met Mary for lunch the first thing she said was.

“Did you get my sunglasses fixed the sun is hurting my eyes so much”

“That's much better thank you darling,he must have cleaned the lens for me, my eyes feel rested already”

4 weeks later my friend rang and ask how my wife was managing with the new prescription.

I said she even wears them to watch the TV ,she say the screen is not so bright now”

He suggested I scratch one of the lens and bring them into him to increase the prescription.

While Mary was asleep I scratched one of the lens and put them on the floor in the kitchen

Next morning after she had showered, I saw her searching around the bedroom.

“Have you seen my sunglasses darling, I thought I put them on the table”

“Is that on the floor over there,the cat must have knocked them off the table”

I noticed Mary screw her eyes up as she looked across the room.

“Thank you Mark”

“Oooo darling, the lens are scratched. I can't wear them like that will you take them in to see if they can replace the lens.

My optician friend asked me if I was sure I wanted my wife to need to wear glasses all the time, because if we increased the prescription any more she would soon need to wear glasses full time.

I didn't need to think long as I was sure that's what I wanted.

So an hour before I met Mary for lunch I picked up the sunglasses with the new lens minus 2 and 4 out prisms.

“Have you got my sunglasses darling I have such a bad headache”

“That's so much better thank you darling,my computer screen seemed so bright today”

4 weeks later when Mary  came home from work.

“Darling Mark we need to talk,

“How would you feel if I said I think I need  to have my eyes tested,have you noticed that I wear my sunglasses a lot now I seem to get double vision when I'm not wearing them”

“I have not told you before but I wear them at work now it helps with the computer,I have read you can get glasses for the protection of the blue light.

“If you didn't like me wearing glasses I could just take them to work with me”

“Well if you really need them I expect I will get used to you wearing them for TV as well”

We arrived at my optitican friend's practice. I had already told him of what my wife had  said.


“It's good that you have come you have what we call latent myopia and some astigmatism”

“You will need to wear glasses full time, it's rather a high prescription for a first pair of glasses so it will take a little time to get used to them and I want to see you in a months time”
“I think it's best if we fit basic C39 lenses. They are a lot cheaper and we probably need to increase the prescription and I can get them ready for later today.

“That's a shock I'm sorry Mark I hope you will still find me attractive wearing glasses”

“I'm sure I will get used to you wearing them dear”

“What is Mary's prescription Doctor”
 
“It's Right -3.00 -2.75 130 prism 6 out   Left -3.75 - 3.00 90 prism out 6”
She has a rather high astigmatism.

While Mary was choosing some frames I asked my friend,had we caused her to get such bad eyesight and how did she not notice she could not read the letter at first.
.
He explained that he had turned the light off before he put a plus 2 lens in the test frame.
Then he turned the letter on, that's why she couldn't read the chart clearly
So she would not realise that she had been wearing prescription lens in the sunglasses then he added the minus lens 

“Do you like these frames on me darling? I can't see them very clearly. Is it the drops in my eyes or has my sight got so bad suddenly?

“Did you notice I struggled to read the first 2 lines on the screen”

“I wouldn't worry about it Dear the frames look very nice on you”

An Hour later we returned to collect her first pair of glasses, I had to hide my excitement

When he took them out of the case I was flabbergasted, the lens were much thicker than I had expected the combination of the astergimision and the prisms was very noticeable.

They looked stunning on her.

The effect of the drops had still not worn off,so she didn't notice the full strength of the lens,the doctor had removed the prescription lens from her sunglasses and suggested she wore them over her new glasses for the next few hours.

While we were waiting for Mary glasses to be made I asked her if she would like to go away for the weekend  to get used to wearing glasses so I booked us a cottage for tonight,rather than go home we set off straight 

As we arrived  the sun started to set and I suggested to Mary she took her sunglasses off.

“I'm rather shy about you seeing me wearing glasses. Are you sure you want me to keep my glasses on”

“Of course you must keep them on darling you remember the doctor said you need to wear them all the time.

Her blue eyes looked a lot smaller but the frame seemed to enversize the bright blueness of them against the large black frames.

“You look beautiful darlings,come here I want to kiss the new you”

As we kissed I could feel the coolness of the lens against my face.

After we had eaten Mary took her glasses off to shower.

“We're are my glasses Mark I can't read the instructions on the new hair conditioner it all seems double”

I stepped inside the shower and placed her glasses back on, I had never wanted her as much before, we made passionate love.

“O Mark do you really love  me wearing glasses, I was so scared to tell you I was having problems seeing”

The next 4 weeks seem to go so fast,Mary wore her glasses nearly all time even in the shower.

We have just arrived for Marys first follow up appointment.

The Doctor took Mary's glass off.

“Can you read any letter for me”

“It's not easy doctor I know the first line has 2 Es,but the rest is just jumbled letters 

“Ok now try with your glasses on”

“O there is only one E there but the other lines still aren't very clear I think there are 2 Bs and 2As”

“Ok let's put the test frame on you and try some different lens”

“That's better I think we will stop there you can read line 6 now and no double vision”
“I expect you both realise that there has been a big change in Mary's sight,we often see this with patients that develop late myopia”

“This is your new prescription Mary
R-5.00-3.00 130 prism out 8 Add 1.25.
L -7.50 -3.75  95 prism out 12 Add1.25

I was excited when I saw the Add on the prescription but did not want to ask if they were going to be varifocals or bifocals 
Then the lady asked Mary did she want one or two pairs of glasses,

Mary quecky said “O just one pair I don't think we can afford 2 pairs”

I'm sure the lady meant did  Mary want separate reading glasses, but I did not say anything.

The next day we returned to collect the new glasses.

The lady look Mary's glasses off and opened the case with the new pair in.

My heart raced with excitement they were D35 bifocals and judging by the thickness of the lens they were C39 hard plastic.

The lady placed them on Mary's face, her eyes instantly seemed to shrink and her face looked much narrower through the lens. The large D35 bifocal lens at the bottom sparkled where the line was my heart was thumping.

The lady told Mary to walk around in them but look straight ahead,
Then she gave Mary a card to hold and read

“Why is it difficult to read the lower lines it was ok at the test”

The lady then told Mary to look down though the bottom of the lens”

“Wow Mark it's so clear that's cleaver”

“You look stunning darling glasses really suit you”

“Can I look in the mirror please”


“O mark the lens are much thicker and what's the line across the lens

The lady explained that they were bifocals the bottom D section is for reading,”Do you remember I asked you if you wanted a second pair for reading”

“O I thought you meant did I was a second pair as a spare pair”

“My grandma wears them I thought they were for old people”

“Yes Madam 25 years of age  is rather young to need them but the Doctor want to try to slow the increase of your myopia” 

“You mean my eyesight will get worse”

“Mark darling do you think I should have got a separate pair for reading instead of these bifocals,the line shows a lot”

“No darling they look fine,I love the way the light sparkles  of the line  hug hug”
 
“Well if you are sure you don't mine I suppose it's better than having to change glasses to read”

I have stopped counting girls wear glasses and given them a score.My wife is a 10 +++ not seen any other young woman wearing bifocals.

Mary has started do a few fashion shows for our eye doctor.

3 months later Mary came home from work early.


“Darling can we go to get my eyes checked I have such a bad headache and everything on computer screen seems to keep moving”

The test took rather longer this time 

R -8.25 -3.25 135 prism out 10 Add 3.50
L -12.75 -4.25 95. Prism out 14 Add 3.50


“How would you feel Mary about modelling hearing aids as well in our show next month?

I was shocked  I had never dream I would see my wife wearing hearing aids as well

“If Mark doesn't mind then it's ok with me”

“Will it damage Marys hearing Doctor”

“It will be fine Mary can have them on the lowest setting, she won't notice much difference”

“If I take the impressions now the moulds would be ready for you collect your new glasses.
“What colour  frames do you want then I can have the moulds made in the same colour. I won't charge you anything for them

“Red I think,is that OK with you Mark”

A week later we went to collect Mary's glasses.

Mary had chosen rather larger frames this time,I had not realised there was going to be such a difference in the lens thickness I remembered that her left eye was worse than the right left.

This time there were 2 lines at the bottom of the lens,

I was surprised that Mary made no comments about the trifocal lines 

“They are so nice Mark I can see so much better,I will have to get used to which part of the lens to look through haha”

“Do you like them Mark I hope you are not ashamed of me having such bad eyesight”

“No of course not darling you look very sexy”

“Did you get the moulds made Doctor for my hearing aids”

“Yes Mary.Are you sure you want to wear them for the fashion show”

“Of course Doctor. You have helped me so much with my eyesight, I'm happy to wear them if it will help your business”

I could not believe what I was hearing,I had never dared to suggest she wore hearing aids.I can't wait for the fashion shop.

“Wow Mark they are bright red to match my glasses and the moulds are red as well”

“Will you show me how to fit them in my ears and how they work Doctor?”. 

“Ooo Doctor they feel very strange,your voice is much louder and clearer”

“Yes Mary it will sound different,it's a Month yet till the fashion show, so maybe a day or so you put them in to get used to it”

“We always go away for a few days when I get new glasses Doctor,Shall I keep the hearing aids in today then I will know what to expect when I wear them for the show”

“Yes If you want to Mary it would save a last minute panic”

“Is it ok with you Mark”

“Yes of course darling”

On the way to the cottage Mary kept looking at herself in the mirror and lifting her head up and down looking though the 3 different sections of the lens,then turning her head to look at her hearing aids in the vanity mirror on the sun shields.
Then she started playing with the volume controls on the aids.

She seemed totally fascinated by her new glasses and hearing aids.

I must admit I got a strong sexual feeling looking at her wearing her new glasses and hearing aids.

The next morning we were going out for the day,I was up first and made breakfast .

When Mary came down she had already put her makeup on and put her hair up,as she turned Immediately noticed she had put the hearing aids in.

I always loved it when Mary wore her hair up, but this time it was even more exciting showing the 2 red BTE hearing aids 

I just said “you look beautiful today darling”

It was just like having a second honeymoon.


Every morning I was up first and got breakfast ready.
Mary would get dressed, do her makeup  then put her hair up before puting the hearing aids in and  coming down.

Neither of us said anything about the hearing aids,I was enjoying seeing her wearing them and her new trifocals.

I didn't want the week to end I had enjoyed seeing Mary wearing the hearing aids 

We arrived back home on Saturday pm I felt rather sad 

Life would be returning to normal tomorrow. I was sure the hearing aids would be put back in their box until the day before the fashion show next month.

I woke early for Sunday church. Mary had got ready for church. I was surprised she had pulled her hair back and plated it,sadly as I had expected no hearing aids in.

I was just about to sit down when Mary said.

'My hearing aids are bleeping darling they need new batteries will you open the little apartment and replace them”


“I need them for church”

“Thank you darling my nail varnish is still a little wet will you put my hearing aids in for me”

“You just push the mould in the right ear the aid has a little red sticker on it.

My hands were shaking 

Still neither of us said anything.

After the service we all went into the Church hall for lunch

We sat at our table and Andrew and Jillian joined us as normal

The first thing Jillian said was.

“I love your new glasses Mary. The colour is beautiful”

“Thank you’ I have to wear trifocals now my eyesight is deteriorating even faster this year. I expect you have noticed how much thicker my left lens is now. I have to have the lens replaced every 3 months”

“Yes I did think the lens looked different ,they really look lovely on you”


Mary turned her head sideways

“Did you notice I also need to wear these hearing aids as well now. I only got them last week but I love them everything is so clear”


“Yes,we were sitting behind you. I did notice you adjust them to the  loop system.we always thought you had a problem hearing some times”

“Yes I was too shy to do anything about it,

“When I first got them it felt strange my voice sounded so loud, so I wore them on the lowest volume setting but now I have them on number 3 it's wonderful hearing things,so clearly”

“I'm sure people will be pleased not to have to repeat things”

“I know Mark loves me wearing them I can hear is heart beating faster when he puts them in for me ha”

 On Monday We meet for lunch.

“Can we go and get me some more hearing aid batteries dear”

The Doctor was pleased to see us.

Mary had to confess that she had been wearing the hearing aids all the time

He was not surprised as Mary had seemed excited about trying them.

After he had checked Mary's hearing he did some adjustments to the left aid As her hearing was worse on that side just like he eyesight?


Time seemed to go by so fast ,Mary was now TOTALLY  dependent on both her glasses and hearing aids,she only took her glasses off when she was about to sleep,she said if she took them off when it was light she couldn't see anything and could feel her eye pulling inwards.

When she took her hearing aids out to shower her voice now sounded so very different. I had read once that Deaf people voices are different 

We returned for Mary's 6 monthly check up and as expected her eyesight had deteriorated more.

I'm sorry Mary but you are not legal to drive with these glasses

It is very difficult to give you your full distance prescription for driving in trifocals

You mean I can't drive any more.

“Well not until we get you new driving glasses”
“The days of just one pair of glasses have gone”

“I can increase the prescription in your trifocals to wear at work and at home”
.
“But for driving you need a much more powerful prescription now”


“And for reading small print a pair of reading glasses”

“For driving your new prescription is”

R -10.50  -3.75 140 prism 10out
L -21.25  -4.50 180 prism 15 out 


“Don't worry about your trifocals  we will change the lens in them when your driving glasses and reading glasses have arrived”

“Your driving glasses will be difficult as we have to find a way of making them lighter weight for you”

2 weeks later the driving glasses had arrived

I was shocked when the doctor put them on Mary
The right lens was a normal single vision lens,but much thicker than before but the right lens had a small 22 mll circle in the middle.


The doctor explained that the left lens was a myodisc lens so that it was thinner and lighter weight .

But to give Mary a fuller field of vision they had fitted a normal lens for the right eye.

Mary looked in the mirror and did not seemed to be upset

“Will I be able to drive again if I wear these”

“Yes it will take a few days to get used to them’! it's best if you get used to them before you drive again and don't go out on your own”


When the doctor put Mary's reading glasses on I could understand why he had fitted a myodisc lens in her driving glasses

They had fitted normal lens in this pair.The left lens was nearly 2 inch thick and that side of her face was very srunking in even more than the other side .

The doctor explained that for reading Mary now need more prism's
R 8.25 -3.75    140  prism out 15
L 19.00 -4.50  180  prism out 25

“They are very heavy Mark but I can read very easy”

“What do they look like on me darling I can't see very far with them on”

“They look fine dear it's good you can see to read”


What else could I say, I 

Let's check your hearing while you are here.


Mary put her old trifocals back on and went into the testing room

20 minutes later they both reappeared.you sit there and drink you coffee
I need to do some adjustments to both aids  we had just finished our coffee when the Doctor returned .

“I have managed to adjust the right aid for you but I'm afraid that because you need a more powerful aid now for your left ear.and I only have it in black”

Mary just smiled,”it's ok Doctor it's not your fault”

I was surprised how much larger the new aid looked. Was it just the colour or was it bigger because of the extra power.

“That feels ok I can tell the difference I have had to have the old one on full volume since last week”

“Is it very much larger Mark,do you mind it's black”

What could I say.

“I have been thinking Mark if we are going by train to our holiday cottage ,shall I leave my trifocals to have the new prescription put in I'm sureI can manage with just my driving glasses and my reading glasses”

“Well darling if you think you can manage,then I think it's a good idea”

When I first saw the driving glasses on her I had a very mixed feeling.

But now sitting opposite her on the train my fetish feelings were rushing through me.

There was this beautiful woman wearing these large black round Gucci glasses,but not with darkened lenses to hide the fact that they were very high prescription lenses.but a person that was happy to make a bold statement about her extremely poor eyesight.

Her right lens was much thicker than before the prism lines were clear to see and the extra power made that side of her face look very shrunken in.

But it was the left lens that sent shivers of excitement running down my spine.most of the lens was opaque colour hiding that side of her face, her only revealing a small 22ml circle with this tiny eye peeking through.

 Added to my excitement, that if I looked in the train window I could see this bright read mould in her ear and this very large new black hearing aid 

The carriage was empty except for us .I could contain myself no longer my hand slide under the table and up her legs the further up my hand went the wider her legs opened then my hand found its way between the forest of thick hair and plunged into this wet sticky pool as my hand swam around her new hearing aid started to whistle,
I felt this warm hand pulling on on me.
Neither of us said anything. The only sound was the high pitch whistle of Mary's hearing aid and a dripping sound on the floor.

Mary said she wanted to sleep now.

When we woke Mary said she would like to try her new reading glasses,would I take her driving glasses off and put them in the case for her .

As I removed them,without the help of the prisms both eyes instantly crossed,and this vacant look came over her face.

“O Mark, can you put my reading glasses on me quickly? I think I'm going blind all I can see is the blurred outline of100s of you.

I lifted the heavy reading glasses from the case and placed them on Mary's face then secured the strap behind her head.

Because Mary has long eyelashes the technician had fitted most of the lens forward of the frame this emphasized the thickness of the lens 

Mary's large blue eyes instantly disappeared Behind the thickness of the lens. The right eye looked about the size of a small pee but the left eye was no bigger than a pinhead 

3 weeks  later we returned to pick up the trifocals,Mary said they were fine,The lady asked Mary if she wanted to keep them on

Mary looked at me “Mark darling do you mind if I put my driving glasses back on.I know the lens look strange but I can see so much better in them”

“It's fine darling,you look just as beautiful wearing them.

“I know my eyesight has changed a lot since you first bought me the prescription sunglasses haha ”

“I never had the courage to tell you before,that I failed both the eye test and the hearing test at school”
“The week before I left and was given glasses and a body worn hearing aid to wear”
“But the first day I wore them at school I was teased so much that  I only wore them for that one day,then pretended I was sick for the rest of the week”

“It was so kind of you not to say anything about my eyesight,as soon as I put the sunglasses on I could see so much better that I knew they had prescription lens in them”

“Would you have still Married me if you had known I would have to wear this type of glasses”

“Yes darling I would give you 100 out of a 100”

“Do you have a school photo of you wearing them darling”

“No darling Mark,you will just have to imagine what I looked like haha”

Everyday I kept wondering what she must have looked like,I had to ring her mother and ask her all about it,

Her mother said if I came round she still had them in her keepsake box.
When I saw them I felt a rush of adrenaline,  She promised not to say anything.

The next day I went to my eye Doctor friend  and described what I had seen.
He said he would look in his basement to see if he had any of those old glasses and hearing aids.

2 weeks later he range to tell me he had something for me.

He had found me a pair of round blue metal  framed NHS  glasses with temple hooks and had fitted Myodisc lens for both eyes,

“I have increased the prescription so that I could fit a  15mm myodisc lens for her right eye as well”

R -12.50  -3.75 140 prism 15 out
L  -23.75  -4.50 180 prism 25 out 


“And this is the type of body hearing aids a child would have been given”

“Friday evening arrived and we caught the train to our summer cottage,it was very late when we arrived so we went straight to bed.

The next morning after breakfast Mary put her makeup on then suggested we go out shopping and have lunch in town.

“You look very pretty this morning dear, I wish I had seen you the day you wore your glasses and hearing aid to school hug “

“Haha I'm sure you don't Mark,You would not have even given me 1 out of a 100 then”

“Are you sure darling”
“Yes I'm sure”

“Wait close your eyes”

“What are you doing Mark you know I can't see without my glasses why have you taken my left hearing aid out”

“Ok open eyes”

What does it say on the wall dear”

“200 out of 100 what does that mean”

“Look in the mirror darling”

“Oooooo my G*D how did you know what my school glasses looked like hahahahaha and that's like the  body worn hearing aid they gave me ha

“O and you have given me 200”

“Come on darling we have shopping to do”

“Do you really want me to wear these glasses and this hearing aid”

“Yes darling we can put that ghost to bed now “

We had a wonderful week,Mary wore the glasses and body aid all the time,she said she could see so much further with these glasses and they were so much lighter.she did not say anything about the hearing aid but always smiled at me as she put the box in her bra.

When we got back home Mary wanted to go and show her mum her new look.

Her mum smiled when she saw Mary and went to the sideboard and brought out a picture of her going to school the only day she wore the glasses and hearing aid thaha 

At church she told Jillian that her eyesight had got worse and she also needed a more powerful hearing aid. 

Monday morning when she was ready for work  she said “Will I still get 200 out of 200 if I wear these glasses and  the body hearing aid all the time now 

I smiled and said yes please you look beautiful xx 

We are both so happy together who know what is in the future for us.
