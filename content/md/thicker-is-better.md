My name is Pike. I am middle aged and I have a 3 sided optical fetish.
I like being nearsighted. I like being cross eyed. I like wearing very thick glasses.
I started getting nearsighted when I was about 9.  I was always curious about mechanical and scientific things so when my Mom took me to the eye doctor the first time it was a whole new world of neat stuff in the exam room to ask questions about.
The doctor was very good about explaining to me in terms I could understand at that time. He explained that I had quite a high correction for a first one and said that it would get higher as time went by most likely due to the very close work on model airplanes and trains I did so much of. He said he knew this from the information sheet my Mom had filled out. He also said I had a slight bit of strabismus developing and explained that was crossed eyes and it was due to close work also. He also said that would get worse in time and asked me if I ever saw double. I said only when I was fooling around making funny faces and crossing my eyes into my nose. He said that was ok and it wouldn’t hurt my eyes any.
After several days, My Mom took me back to get my new glasses. When the nurse
put them on me it was like a tight rubber band had been removed from my head and I could see things so sharp it was scary. I mentioned about the rubber band effect and she said that was due to the prism correction and would go away in a few hours.
The next morning when I got up and put my glasses on I noticed a very slight and quick double vision effect. It went away in maybe a second so I forgot about it.
As time went by I had prescription increases about every 6 months and by high school my glasses were the thickest ones in school. About a quarter inch on the outer edges.
About this time my folks bought me a used computer. I soon learned about the internet and surfing it. That is why I am writing this story. Back when I had had glasses for a year or so I discovered the various ways I could tip and angle them when looking through them and how that moved or distorted the image. I noticed when I rotated them sideways I saw 2 images one above the other. This made me tingle and I enjoyed the view. I started doing this as often as I could when alone. When I was 12 I got hit in the face by a baseball and it broke my glasses at the bridge. I had a friend walk me home and I got my spare pair. That night while looking to see if I could fix the break somehow, I held the 2 pieces up to my eyes and started moving them in various directions. As I moved the pieces apart I could feel my eyes straining. As I moved the pieces together the strain went away and a very relaxed feeling came on. While having the 2 pieces together as close as possible I happened to look over the top and noticed that I was seeing double by quite a bit. I looked back through the lenses and all was normal. I looked back and forth several times and moved the pieces to obtain the most deflection. I went to a mirror and looked at myself through the lenses. I was noticeably cross eyed. I tingled quite strongly.
As time went by I came across the Eyescene and V&S websites and started learning all about fetishes and the associated things. It didn’t take long before I was actively trying to increase my myopia as much as I could before I was too old. I also took up GOC after I moved away from home. I bought several pairs of glasses on the internet without a prescription. Some were just stronger in sphere than I required. Some had way more prism than I required. Some had both. Some had more on just one side. Usually the right. I really liked how I looked with just the right eye turned in all the way.
I now know this is called strabismus fixus. With any of the glasses I have now I can see normally 20/20 with them on but see extremely fuzzy and double without them.
From reading the internet, I learned that many people while not publicly saying, desire
to be quite nearsighted and wear very thick glasses but by the time they discover how to achieve it are too old for it to happen. I was always this way. I always wanted my glasses to be thicker but never could get results because I was too old.
Eventually I read somewhere that wearing prism’s if you did not need them would 
make you cross eyed. I was already wearing prism’s and was already somewhat cross eyed. I still wanted the thickest glasses I could get. I decided to increase my prism amount and see what would happen. I wore the new glasses for about a week and noticed when I took them off the double images were separated more than normal.
In about 3 months I got another pair of glasses with more prism. This made the outer edges almost an inch thick now. I wore them for about a week and noticed that when I took them off my eyes turned all the way into my nose and I could not fuse at all any more. I had to instantly go to the bathroom.
From talking to other people on the internet that desire more myopia or strabismus I find that some can wear all sorts of prescriptions and their eyes never change while others can get certain types of glasses and their eyes will change very rapidly, some permanently, some not.

As they used to say after radio programs, the names and places in this story have been changed  to protect the disinterested.
