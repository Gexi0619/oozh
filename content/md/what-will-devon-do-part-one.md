Now 26 year old Devon has in many ways had an life that can only be described as ideal. Devon a college graduate married his high school sweetheart Regina last year and the couple are expecting their first child in March. All tests on Mom and the couples unborn son look good. Devon after college went to work making good money with great benefits such as company paid health insurance for the whole family. Devon when his son is born will get the customary six weeks of paid maternity leave for new Fathers.
One of the things at least according to Devon that make his life less then ideal happened in the summer between 4th and 5th grade. Devon never cared much for baseball but every year the family went to one or two minor league games in their area. It was on one of these trips that Devon had to squint to see the scoreboard. Devon's cousin who is with the family notices this and has him try on her glasses. Devon notices he can see the scoreboard clearly with glasses but when he tries looking at something up close it's blurry. Devon as required by the school system had an eye exam before starting 4th grade showing good vision though there was the slightest hint of Astigmatism. Devon even though he hates the thought of wearing glasses asks his parents to get him an eye exam which would not be required by the school until before staring 6th grade. Devon had so gradually gone Myopic that he didn't notice the vision change. Devon's first pair of glasses are -1.00R and -1.25L with Astigmatism for his left eye only. Devon finds out that the most likely reason he couldn't see up close with his cousins glasses is the Myopic correction was stronger then he needed.
Devon hates almost everything about wearing glasses such as the way he looks, the way they feel and  the nose pads on the wire rims he got rubbing his nose. Devon who knows from research in time his vision will get worse does wear glasses almost full time from the start. Devon goes thru the normal prescription changes and  by the time he graduates high school his prescription was -4.75R and -5.25L and now he has minor Astigmatism in both eyes. Devon at age 21 while in college has his prescription increased to -5.00R and -5.50L still with Astigmatism. Devon's prescription at an eye exam every year  does not change.
Devon's Optometrist two years ago began talking to him about possibly having Lasik knowing his insurance is one of very few that will pay for the procedure and all follow up visits as well as the associated eye drops.t
Devon who did try contacts in high school but quickly figured out he couldn't stand touching his eyes is interested in Lasik. Devon does a lot of research joining internet forums on the Lasik and checks out some You Tube videos. Finally this year on black Friday instead of going shopping has the very comprehensive Lasik exam to find out if his vision can be corrected to the point of not needing glasses. Devon is told he has a 90% chance of being free from glasses. Devon goes ahead and schedules Lasik for Friday December 20th but he's having second thoughts after doing still more research. The reason Devon if he has Lasik needs to do so before the end of the year is his insurance will no longer pay for it after the first of the year. Devon is off work from December 20th until the first of the year because the company shuts down every year for Christmas vacation. Devon thought having Lasik while the company is on shutdown would be a good idea. Most Lasik patients who have the Procedure on Friday are able to return to work Monday. The instructions for Lasik say no driving for 24 hours but patients with Myopia are told they most likely can drive themselves to the one day follow up.
Devon has kept Lasik scheduled but is having serious second thoughts after all the research he's done and from watching videos. While Devon's opinion on wearing glasses hasn't changed since grade school he's wondering if he should resign himself to the idea he will wear them for the rest of his life. 
What will Devon do? Stay tuned this story will be updated next Friday.
