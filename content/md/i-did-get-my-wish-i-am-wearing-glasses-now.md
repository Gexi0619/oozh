Kevin a sturdy 12 yr old, has an older sister Amy, a very pretty girl,.
Both parents wear glasses, the mother a -4.25 myopic and the father a +3.50 hyperopic.
Kevin thinks his dad is very a handsome man, and looks fantastic wearing glasses.
Because Kevin looks a lot like his dad, he wants to look exactly like him.
He wants to wear glasses just like his dad.
Kevin and his dad get along very well,  both love to go camping, fishing and sports.

Before going back to school,  Kevin and his sister had their annual eye exam.
While his sister had her exam, Kevin tried some frames and found one he really liked.
He sure liked the way he looked wearing glasses, they sure made him look a lot like his dad.  
He put the frame aside so that after his exam, when he is told he has to wear glasses, knows 
where the frame is, he is all set.. 
Amy was very upset, she has to wear glasses, and wants to wear contact lenses 
Mother agreed, and Amy got her contact lenses, and a pair of glasses.
Kevin was very disappointed, that after his exam, he was told he did not need to wear glasses.

When Amy got her new glasses, she would not wear them, and kept them in their case.
Kevin asked her if he could try her glasses, to find out what wearing glasses is like.
Amy handed him the glasses case, here, you can have them, I hate them.
Kevin took the glasses into his room, opened the case, and took out the glasses.
As soon as he put the glasses on, got a fantastic feeling, looking through the lenses
was exciting.
He was surprised he could not see to well wearing the glasses, everything he looked at,. looked  distorted.
Looking at the open glasses case, he noticed a folded piece of paper.
He looked at it and realized it was the prescription for Amy s glasses, -1.25 for both eyes.
Yes, that is what he needed, he now had a prescription and could order his own glasses on line.
When he looked in the mirror again wearing Amy s glasses, realized that the lenses in Amy s glasses certainly did not look the same as the lenses in his dad s glasses, he did not like that.
Now he remembered, that when he saw Amy wear her glasses her eyes looked smaller, just like her mother.
The lenses in his dad s glasses made his eyes look larger, that is what he wanted.
He put Amy s glasses back in the case and returned them to her room.
How was he going to get his vision bad enough to wear glasses just like his dad?

Kevin after spending some time on the computer, now knows the difference between myopia and hyperopia and how different the lenses look.
He wants to be hyperopic and wear lenses that makes your yes look a little larger, just like his dad.
The other night he asked his dad about his glasses and how long he has been wearing them.
I started to wear glasses in my early teens, I had trouble reading and had a lot of headaches.
Wearing glasses fixed my problems.

Kevin s best friend is Logan, they have been friends since grade one.
Logan has been camping and fishing with Kevin and his dad.
Kevin has told Logan quite a few times, his desire to wear glasses and look more like his dad.
Well if you want to wear glasses so much, get yourself a pair of plain ones.
No, I want prescription glasses for hyperopia so my eyes will look larger, just like my dad s glasses.

Both Kevin and Logan are good students, and both like reading books, and spending a lot of time on the computer.
One day Logan asked Kevin if he ever has headaches.
Yes, sometimes, when I have been reading too long, but not very often.
Lately I have a lot of headaches, and my mother does not like me to take pain killers, she made an appointment with the doctor for me.

About a week later Logan told Kevin, the doctor had told his mother that he is pretty sure, I might have a vision problem, and suggested I have an eye exam.
So next Saturday I have an appointment for an eye exam, you want to come with me?
You can tell me what they do, I never had an eye exam, before.
Sure I will come with you, lucky you, you might have to wear glasses, like I always wanted.

Logan s parents had made all the arrangements with the optical store, because they thought Logan was old enough to pick out the frame he would like, if he was prescribed glasses.
When they were at he optical store, Kevin looked around and tried some frames while Logan had his eye exam. 
It did not take Kevin long to find the frame he really liked, tried it on, looked at himself and wished it was his.
When Logan was finished with his exam, told Kevin he was prescribed glasses, and he was not very happy about it. 
He showed me his prescription, and I noticed the plus signs, my favorite type of lenses, lucky guy.

Kevin. I wish you were wearing glasses, then I would not feel so bad about having to wear glasses., 
I hate the thought of me being the only one going to school wearing glasses..
Then the optician came over to see if Logan needed any help selecting frames, and mentioned to him they were having a 2 for 1 sale to day, so you can select more than one frame. 
Logan said, that is fantastic, and that gives me an idea.
Kevin, I make you a deal, I get one pair of glasses, and I will give you the other pair, but you have to promise me, that you will wear the glasses when we are going to school, so I am not the only one coming to school wearing new glasses.
Kevin could not believe it, a pair of prescription glasses with the lenses that he liked.
Sure, I will do that, I will be wearing the glasses going to school.

So about 2 hours later, both Kevin and Logan walked out of the optical store wearing glasses.
Kevin loved the feel of the glasses on his face, and was surprised he could see quite well, except things
far away looked a little blurry.
He remembered the optician telling Logan, that after about a week or two, it will go away.
The boys sat down at the food court and had some refreshments.
Kevin, I can t believe how much you look like your dad wearing glasses.
Thank you, I wish I could wear the glasses all the time, I love them.
Perhaps, if you wear them as much as possible, you might be prescribed glasses at your next eye exam.
I hope so, I certainly will try.

When Monday came, Logan wearing his glasses, went to pick up Kevin.
Walking down the street Kevin put his glasses on, to wear to school as he had promised Logan. 
They both received a lot of comments, good and bad.
Logan was sure glad Kevin was wearing glasses to, with both of them wearing glasses there were not as many comments and smart remarks directed at one person as usual.

Kevin sitting near the back of the classroom, noticed it was difficult to read what was written on the blackboard, the letters and figures looked a little fuzzy.
He refused to take his glasses off or look over the top of them, remembering what the optician had told 
them, it was only for a short time.
About a week later he could see everything in the distance perfectly clear, fantastic, all he wished for now was to be able to wear the glasses all day long.

After wearing the glasses for about 3 months at school and doing homework, he was sure his vision was better when wearing the glasses.
Wanting to wear his glasses full time so badly, he told his mother that lately he had more headaches when reading and perhaps he should have an eye exam.
Logan had a lot of headaches, and since he started to wear glasses does not have headaches anymore.
Well you are not due for an eye exam for another 3 months.
But if you are suffering with headaches, I will make an appointment for you now, you have grown quite a bit lately, and that might have affected your eye sight.

When Kevin had his eye exam, the optometrist told Kevin he was surprised with the results.
At your last exam, I expected you to become myopic, you are now hyperopic, and have a little astigmatism
I suggest you wear your glasses full time, here is your prescription.
Kevin was so happy, when he read his prescription, + 1.25 for the right, and + 1.50 for the left eye,  now he could wear his glasses all the time. 
When his glasses were ready, and he put them on loved his new look.
Having worn Logan glasses for some time, he had not much of a problem with his distant vision.

When Kevin came home proudly wearing his new glasses, received a lot of good comments,
The comment he liked best when he was told he looks like his dad now.
Well I have my wish, I look more like my dad now.
 My eyes look a little larger now, just like my dad.
I am so happy, I am wearing glasses now, and look more like my dad.
