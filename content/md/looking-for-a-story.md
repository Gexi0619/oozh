Does anyone know where to find this story, or what it’s called? I’m looking for a story I really enjoyed that someone wrote here years ago. It started with a girl laying on her bed contemplating a dot on the ceiling that had been getting blurrier and blurrier until it wasn’t even perceptible anymore.
