Life is full of surprises!

My parents wear glasses, my older sister and brothers wear glasses
I also wanted to wear glasses, I sure felt left out.
Finally the day came, when I was in grade three, and was told I was myopic and should wear glasses.  
I really did not want to be seen wearing glasses, but the improvement in my vision was so fantastic, 
I soon wore my glasses all the time.
My girl friend Kelley, really liked my glasses, and told me she would like to wear glasses. 
When I had my next eye exam, and started to wear glasses with stronger lenses, I gave Kelley my old 
glasses, and she wears them now as much as she can.
I must say she looks fantastic wearing glasses.
A couple of years later, Kelley was prescribed glasses.
My prescription increased after every eye exam, and now that I am a senior in high school, my prescription reads. right eye -6.50, and left eye -6.75, and some astigmatism.
I am a proud of my glasses, and like the way I look wearing them.
Kelley s glasses prescription is now -3.00.
I have some other girl friends, who cannot figure out, why I don t want to wear contact lenses.
They can t believe, I enjoy wearing my glasses, and that I like the way I look, even with my high prescription. 

We are having a school dance, and when the dance first start, the guys always stand on the side looking at the girls, and talking.
That is the time, Kelley and I always have a couple of dances, which we both enjoy. 
 Later that night, after I had danced with so many guys and girls, that my feet were hurting.
After the announcement for the last dance, a handsome, glasses wearing guy asked me for a dance.
I had seen him before, but did not know him, but I liked his looks, and I accepted.
He was a good dancer, a great talker, and said, I know we have seen each other before,  but never met.   
I know for sure, that I am dancing with the prettiest glasses wearing young lady in this school.
My name is Logan, and I am sure your name is Amy,
You are right Logan, my name is Amy and I am glad to meet you.
We only had a chance to talk for a very short time, because the dance was finished. 
Logan insisted, he take me home, and after a lot of pleasant conversation, we arrived at my house. 
After making plans for a date,  he kissed me good night, and went home.
I loved all the dancing, and sure had a great night, and I am looking forward to my date. 

When Logan picked me up for our date, complimented me again how nice I looked wearing glasses, and told me we were going to have a great time.
We went to a nice restaurant, which also has a small dance floor. 
You can dance there, to your favorite music by selecting your choice of music, on an old fashioned jukebox .
The meal was great, and we danced quite a few times,
When both parties wear glasses, glasses are sure to come up during the conversation.
Logan told me, that when he was 4 years old, was diagnosed with a lazy eye, after patching the other eye and wearing glasses the problem was solved.
His present prescription is in the + 4.00 range.
Then I told him my story,  how I was the last one in the family to start wearing glasses.
We agreed, we both like wearing glasses, and like the look of glasses. 
What a surprise how a very pleasant evening was completely ruined, when a big minus glasses wearing guy, came towards us, and said to Logan.
You broke our date, to go out with her?
I was completely confused, and asked Logan what was going on.
Oh, he is my jealous boy friend.
Logan s friend said, he is my lover, I can see, why he took you out.
You have about the same myopic prescription as I have, and he loves strong myopic glasses. 
I was all confused, Logan what is going on?
Are you bi sexual, and want everything?
Please take me home, I don t want to be second best.
On the way home, Logan apologized, I some times get carried away by the looks of stronger minus glasses.

The next day when I told Kelley my story, she could not believe what had happened. 
We talked about sex, and I realize I don t know very much about it.
Kelley told me she liked to watch porn, and that there are many segments now, with people wearing glasses.
Then she asked me if I was game for a new experience.
I told her I would, so she and I got into the car, 
Kelley drove to a small plaza, and we walked into a store called the LOVE SHOP.
She told me, here I would find out, what life is all about.
What a surprise, when I saw what was on display. 
I was very uncomfortable, when a glasses wearing young man approached me, and asked if he could help me.
I think, I am just looking around a bit, I have never been in a store like this.
Well, if you have any questions, my name is Jeff. by the way, I love your glasses, you look fantastic. 
Thank you Jeff, I must say, you look very handsome wearing glasses.
This started a conversation, Jeff told me working in the store is just a summer job, while going to university.
Kelley came over to get me, and showed me a lot of different items, and told me how they were used.
Then she told me, she had made a purchase, and was ready to go home.
When we left, Jeff waived at me, and I waved back.
Going with Kelley to that store, sure was a whole new educational experience.

I am getting ready to start my course to become an optician, a two year course at our local university.
Liking the looks of glasses, and enjoying wearing them, and knowing how useful they are for proper vision, made me decide to become an optician.
I had an other eye exam, and another Â½ diopter increase in my prescription, 
My new glasses look fantastic, I love them.
Now I am ready to go to university.

I am really enjoying my studies and am getting good marks.
After the Christmas break, I was in the library to find a book with  information, that I needed, when somebody touched my shoulder.
When I looked up, could not believe my eyes, what a surprise.
Hi, I did not expect  to see you here.
Well if you remember right, I told you when met me at my summer job, that I go to the university.
Amy, can I buy you a coffee?
Yes, I would like that, I like to hear all about your studies.
When we sat down with our coffee, Jeff told me that his uncle owns the Sex Shop, and he likes him there to fill in during his regular staff vacations.
He pays me well, and I cannot refuse him, he is my godfather.
I have learned a lot working at the store, but that has nothing to do with my studies here.
I am in the third year of a science course. To become a high school teacher. 
Science is more my line.
What course are you taking?
I like to be an optician, I like to help adults and children, to select the right kind of frames, so they look their best when enjoying their improved vision, when wearing new glasses.
You will make an excellent optician, I am sure.
We talked, until the cafeteria staff told us to go, because they were closing.
Since that night, Jeff is my steady boyfriend.

Time goes fast, and I have graduated, and now am a licensed optician and contact lens fitter.
I have a full time position, at a very busy optical store.
I really enjoy my job, assisting customers select a suitable frame, and having them feel good about their new glasses.
Every once and a while, I have customers I remember from high school,  or people I know from church.
What satisfies me the most, is when a young person wearing their first pair of glasses,  look around and across the street, and cannot believe what they can see now, leaves on trees, and signs across the street. 
I sure made the right decision becoming an optician.

To day when I was fitting a customer with her new glasses, a man s voice asked for assistance.
I told him, I would be there as soon as I was finished with my customer. 
When I went to see the new customer, could not believe my eyes, there was Logan and his friend.
Hello Logan, how can I help you?
Amy, it is you?
Yes, I am an optician now.
We want to get new frames, with thick lenses, have you any suggestions?
I showed them some frames, and asked Logan to try them on.
When Logan and his partner Jim, both had decided on a new frame, they handed me their prescriptions,
After the taking the measurements, told them their glasses would be ready in about three days.
Before leaving, Jim told me again, he wanted his lenses as thick as possible, I assured him they both would love their new glasses.

When Logan and Jim came to pick up their new glasses, I asked them to sit down.
Logan was first and loved the look of his new +4.50 glasses.
I made sure his glasses were fitting properly, before I handed Jim his glasses.
He put his glasses on, and looked in the mirror, wow they look fantastic.
Logan looked at them and said, Jim you never looked this beautiful before, I love your new look.
Jim s glasses with the -7,50, CR 39 lenses, sure were thick on the edges.
They both were thrilled with their new glasses, and thanked me, and told me I had done a terrific job.
Let s go home and celebrate.

Kim told me she is going to get married, and I have to be her maid of honor.
When talking to Kim, I mentioned to her that I have not heard from Jeff lately, and I had a hard time getting a hold of him.
Kim said I hate to tell you this, but I saw Jeff with a blonde girl at the movies last night.
I can t believe it, I have to find out.
When at last I got a hold of Jeff, and I asked him about the blonde girl, he told me she is my new girl friend, and he was going to tell me before, but forgot about it.
Life is full of surprises.
I don t know what is wrong with me, but I sure have no luck with guys so far.

We are so busy at our store. that management have hired a new optician to help me out.
Carol, the new optician, is a very pretty, glasses wearing girl,
She has a big smile, and a nice personality, and is a pleasure to get along with, and told me she has a twin brother, Brandon who a teacher.
Carol and I soon became friends, and we like going out and spending some time together at Carol s apartment, or at my house.
My brother David, to day met Carol, and I think noticing his reaction likes her.
David brought us some refreshments, sat down with us, and joined the conversation.
When Carol was ready to go,  David offered to drive her home.
With a big smile on her face said, thank you, I appreciate that.

The following Sunday, David suggested he drive me to Carol s place, as he liked to ask her a question.
When we arrived at Carol s  apartment, were introduced to her twin brother,
I got all wet, when I shook Brandon s hand, what a guy, a girls dream.
We had a great time and decided we all go out together for a night on the town.
What a great time we had, and the result, two couples in love.

About a year later, two glasses wearing couples said their wedding vows, in a big double wedding.
The wedding was held in a big tent, at Carols parents farm.
Looking around, and then at my handsome loving husband, realized again ,that life is full of surprises.
