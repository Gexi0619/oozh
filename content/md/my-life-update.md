Please read  MY LIFE first 

Life has changed a lot since I last wrote
I was headhunted 2,months ago.
I now work away from home from Monday to Friday. 
Just  before I get home on a Friday evening I put my wife's trifocals on and hearing aids in.
She won't let me forget how I made her start wearing hearing aids.
So when at home I have to wear them all the time.

I don't feel comfortable wearing them in my new position so as soon leave the house I put them in my briefcase.I must admit that reading the phone is a problem now

Just before I left for work on Monday morning I got a text message to say that I had to fly to Germany, so next weekend I would not be able to come home 

I arrived at the airport 2 hours before my flight. The departure lounge was very busy, but I managed to find a table where a couple we're just leaving..
I was enjoying my coffee and trying to read my paper when a young lady wearing large dark glasses and a head scarf asked if the seat opposite was free.
I politely said she was welcome to sit there as I would be leaving soon,

Just as I was getting up I felt a SMS message arrive on my phone

This was going to be embarrassing the light in this part of the airport was poor.I squinted at my phone

Then a quiet voice said 

"Why don't you put your reading glasses on' I know it's difficult to see in this light"

I tried to explain that I had not got them with me.

"You are welcome to borrow my old ones,but I'm sure they will be to strong"

I didn't know what to say I really needed to read the message.

I squinted again at my phone.

"Don't be silly”


Her voice seemed familiar.
She opened a glasses case and lent forward and placed these thick heavy reading glasses on my nose and hooked the cables over my ears,my heart was racing. Her perfume was wonderful,where had I smelt that before.

I could not see very far but the print on my phone was so large and clear.


I looked up but the lady had gone

My flight was called and I hurried to the departure gate.

I took my seat in the plane ,I needed to reply to the text message before we took off. There was nobody looking so I nervously took the thick reading glasses out of my pocket and put them on.
How could anyone need such a strong prescription, who was that woman,there was still a faint aroma of her perfume on the glasses, I had to keep them on.

Just before the plane landed I reluctantly I took them off and put them in my bag

As soon as I got to my hotel room I felt this overwhelming desire to put the glasses back on. 
It was still only 10am so I spent the rest of the day working on my tablet, I had to hold it closer to me but I soon got used to the weight of these thick glasses on my nose,sadly the smell of the perfume was fading a little
As I pleasured myself I tried to picture what the lady must look like that had worn them. 
It was time to go down for the evening meal,I still couldn't see very far in them,so I reluctantly took them off and put them in my pocket.
I picked up the menu. What had I done?
After wearing the glasses all day I could no longer read any of the print without them.
I had no option but put the glasses back on, suddenly the armor of the perfume seemed to intensify.

A quiet voice said.

"I'm glad the glasses help"
"Please don't take them off, you have beautiful big blue eyes"

I looked up it was the lady with you black glasses and the headscarf.

"Please may I join you "

She sat down and smiled before picking up the menu.

"The print is far to small for me to read,my eyesight gets worse each year"

She took a rather large glasses case out of her bag, as she lend forwards the intense armor of her perfume hit me,my body seemed freeze,

"Will you help me please,can you put my reading glasses on for me,they are new,I'm rather embarrassed how I must look wearing them ,without glasses I'm helpless"

 As I looked through the thick bowls of the reading glasses I was now dependent on for seeing close,
I realised that her dark glasses  were not normal sunglasses,they had dark side shields on them, the type blind people wear,also they had the thickest plus lenticular lens that I had ever seen.her huge eyes filled the 2 circles.

My hands were shaking as I was about to remove her glasses

"Be Careful they have cable hook's over my ears to stop them slipping down. Mind you don't knock my hearing aids out "


As I lifted the black glasses off of her face,my heart was racing,the years of wearing such powerful lenses meant her eye muscles were now totally useless,her large eyes instantly closed and disappeared back into their tiny sunken sockets,it  was obvious that they were virtually blind.But I could now see her face

"ALICE  DARLING ITS YOU"i
 
"What are you doing here"

"Please put some glasses back on me before I tell you,I'm sure you can see I'm nearly blind now"

As I Opened the case  I gasped.
Without thinking I said "What are these"
I went red and started to stutter my apologies.

"It's ok I know they are dreadful I only collected them yesterday and I have not had the courage to try them yet,please put them on for me,I would like you to be the first person seeing me wearing them"
"It's the only way I will be able see to read now"

Both lenses were even thicker than the glasses I was now wearing,but the right lens had this small black telescopic device attached to it.

I placed them on her face.Instantly her eyes became so Hugh again,filling the whole of the lenses..

As I hooked the cable over her ears I could not help myself, I just had to touch her hearing aids .What was that cord on the end of them for?

She slowly adjusted the telescopic device.

"That's better I can see you ok now"

We both just sat there staring into each other's eyes.

I felt her hand under the table grasping me.
Both our bodies started to go into spasms as we pleasured each other, just like in the restaurant in England many years ago..

After we had eaten Alice re-adjusted the telescopic device on her right lens and we slowly made our way to the lounge.

It was then that Alice dropped a bombshell.

"My father owns the company you now work for,it was me that headhunted you.and I arranged for you to come here for 2,weeks"
"He was taken ill 3 years ago that is why I had to leave England and come here to work"
"But I missed seeing you and our chats,you were the only man that accepted my disabilities,and said I looked pretty.

At that moment the porter came over a told Alice her driver had arrived to pick her up

"Will you put my dark glasses on for me,they help hide the thickness of my lens"
"My cheifer will pick you up at 9am and I will show you the town"

She took the porter's arm and was gone before I could say anything.
It wasn't untill I got back to my room I realized I was still wearing the glasses that Alice had given me.
As I took them off  my eyes refused to focus on anything.

When I woke the next morning my eyes were hurting and nothing was very clear.
I reached for the glasses.
What a Relief I could see again.
I got ready,And was about to leave the room when I suddenly remembered that it was Alice that first put hearing aids I my ears.


Her words came flooding back to me.
"Will you wear the hearing aids for me then I won't me the only person wearing them"

I hurriedly pushed the mounds onto my ears and turned the aids on
I glanced into the mirror as I passed .Was that really me.

As I got into her limousine I was greeted with a big smile as she kissed me the thick bulging lens of our glasses clashed .

"Its so sweet of you George to wear the old hearing aids that I gave you"

"I expect you are wondering why my new hearing aids are so big now and what the box is for that's hanging around my neck is" 
"I have very little hearing left  now so if my driver want to talk to me or I'm in a business meeting they speak into a microphone and this box picks it up and I hear in in my hearing aids,"
"I think it would be nice if you wore the same"

She lent towards me and took my hearing aids out. 
Her voice sounded faint and distance now,
I had never admitted even to myself how much I really needed them.
I could feel her pushing the soft nipple of the new mould deep to my right ear.then the large body of the aid was hooked over my ear.it took her a few seconds for her to do the same with my left ear ,as she turned them on I heard  her voice  saying "I LOVE YOU GEORGE" it seemed to be so loud and clear inside my head.


I was stunned,what was I to say.
"Ummm Do you always wear dark glasses when you are outside Alice?"

"No I never used to George"
"But since I collected my 2 new distance pairs I don't have the confidence to wear them in public,as a matter of fact I have never put them on since I got them,you saw how ugly my new reading glasses are"

Was this an invitation for me to put them on her?

At that point the limousine slowed and the driver's voice boomed into my hearing aids, "This is the north side of the park madam,shall I pick you up at 1 pm on the south side for lunch.

We spent the next 2 hours holding each other's hands and slowly walking through the park,I was desperate to see Alice wearing her new distance glasses but the sun was too bright to even suggest it.

I'm now sure we both have a glasses fetich, but if her glasses were really ugly I didn't want to upset her,so I had to wait for the right moment.

We were about to sit down for lunch. Alice handed me her bag.

"I need my reading glasses George they are in my bag"

 I opened her bag, was she teasing me, there were 3 large glasses cases there.

A big smile came over her face.

"Its the red case you need, I know you want to see the others,but you will have to wait haha"

I did not want to wait,but I knew she wanted me to take her dark glasses off and replace them with her reading glasses.
 Again Without the help of her glasses Her huge eyes instantly shrunk back into their tiny sockets.her eyelids seemed to close like shutters.
After wearing glasses since she was a year old her eye muscle now had no control of their own.
She looked so vulnerable  as she blindly smiled at me

"George if you think I look prettier without glasses,as long as you hold my hand I could leave them off for a little after lunch"


"We will see dear, you look beautiful with glasses”

“That's so kind of you George, you are the only man that has ever said that to me

I thought to myself that if she really wanted to be seen sometimes without glasses on, maybe she would be better having 2 prosthetic eyes made rather than having tiny shrunken dark eyes and that blind vacant look.
I'm sure Being TOTALLY blind would not be very different from what she could see without glasses now.


Lunch was wonderful. I loved watching Alice adjusting the binocular lens as she looked at her food then adjusting it again to see me.

“You look so handsome wearing glasses George,your eyes look so big and sexy, I wish I had blue eyes like yours ,not my dull brown eyes”

“You have beautiful big eyes as well Alice Dear”

“Don't you mind being seen with me wearing these glasses with this ugly binocular device attached to it”


“No of course not dear, if it helps you see better then it's fine”


“I must go to my office now,will you come with me George,if you let me hold your arm I will keep these glasses on”

“Good afternoon Madam, are you going down,or up to your office”

“Up please James” 

As the door lift door opened, I just stared ahead.

“Do you like it George this is my private office”

“Is it the whole floor?”

“No George, it's my apartment as well”

“Can you get the blue case out of my bag,,I want to show you around. But I can't  see to walk on my own in these”
“Please take these off of me first I don't want to see what the the others look like with my thick ugly lens in them,when I choose the frames I was thinking of you,the day I collected them I would not let the lady take them out of the case or put them on me, I wanted to wait until you could do it”

Excitedly I removed her reading glasses,I opened the case and my gaze was transfixed on the round bright red,thick plastic oversized frames.
I had expected to see Myodisc lenses but instead they had enormously thick bulging C39 Franklin bifocal lenses,with fogged side shields the difference between the two parts of the lenses looked like a door step..
Alice was amazed how much better she could see now than with her old glasses,but she would still need to put her reading glasses on for close work. We spent the next hour walking around her Apartment.

“This will be your office George,It's next to mine, I think some of my managers are taking advantage of my disabilities I want you to be my eyes and ears for me please” 
“Next to it is your private room I will arrange to have your things brought up.

I loved how Alice kept looking up and down through the different parts of  bifocal lens,it was obvious from the way she squinted  that she could not see things in the far distance, what surprise was waiting in the other glasses case.

After we had eaten our evening meal Alice suggested we watch a movie.

“Will you manage to see it dear”

“I hope so Dear I know you want to see what's in the other case haha”
“Please take my bifocal off I don't want to see the shocked look on your face when you open them,I refused to try them on or even look at them at the opticians”

My hands felt hot and sticky and my trouser were tight and bulging.
I had seen people holding opera glasses at the theatre but never glasses like these.
The lenses were not as thick as her reading glasses,but unlike the small telescopic device attached to one lens,these had 2 long bright red binoculars attached to the centres of each lens.the remainder of the lens were fogged as were the side shields so her eyes would have to focus  only through the binoculars.
I placed them on Alice's face and hooked the cables behind her ears, letting my hands slowly rub her hearing aids,then tighten the strap behind her head.
Then I started to adjust each side of the binoculars until Alice could see the TV on the other side of the room

“Daring darling George I can see the TV now, O that's wonderful you have chosen the film of Marilyn Monroe wearing glasses. I walked towards the TV and took my glasses off and
I put Alice's new reading glasses on and adjusted the telescopic device.
Up to now we had only pleasured each other,but now was the time to take our relationship into a far deeper level.

When we woke we both still had our glasses on Alice slowly walked to the window and looked out.

“I never knew the view was so beautiful from up here, do I look stupid wearing these George”

“ No darling, Take my hand and  let's look in the mirror, 

After breakfast Alice had arranged a managers meeting.

“Which  glasses shall wear George,I normal wear my black sunglasses”

“I think you should wear your new bifocals and place your reading glasses next to you on the desk”
“I will sit next to you and help you change your glasses if you want me to”

The meeting went well at first.
They were shocked when they saw Alice wearing her new thick bifocals,I could see some of them hoping to see her put the strange looking glasses on that were beside her papers.
Just before the meeting finished there were a lot of papers for Alice to sign, she turned to me and whispered to me to change her glasses for her.
They got to see Alice with her reading glasses on but then when she refused to sign the papers,their faces soon changed when some stealing had been discovered.At that point I took over the meeting and said a full audit would take place starting  next week.but until then all the systems would be locked down.


Alice eyesight is so bad that she can't even see what she looks like without glasses on.
Recently she has kept asking me to take photos of her without glasses
I have made lots of excuses not to,How could I explain to her what her eyes really looked like.
So I had to eventually gave in, she spent the morning without glasses on,and I took some photos for her, 
She said it was nice not having the heavy glasses on, but she felt totally blind without them,
When she saw the photos she was in floods of tears when she realised how tiny and old her sunken her eyes now looked,

Alice wanted to have blue eyes, so we have tried coloured contact lenses,also blue hard scleral lens, neither of them were of any use as she could not see any better with them in and her eyes still looked sunken and closed.

Today we are going to collect a pair of prosthetic eyes for Alice to try.
To look at they are just like normal prosthetic eyes for a person that has had their eye removed or is completely blind.
The hard shell part of the prosthetic eye will just fit under her eyelids keeping her eyes wide open.They are a lovely bright white,the artist had painted 2 beautiful bright blue eyes,with piercings black irises

Alice said they were very comfortable, much better than the hard scleral lens.
Also not being to see anything was more relaxing than just blurred useless distorted shapes and the lights flashing.

We decided she should try them at home first,so I was taught how to put them in and take them out for her.

“Why are you putting my reading glasses on me George”

She screamed with delight when she saw the photos I had taken.

“Is that really me darling George they look beautiful just like real eyes not prosthetics, are you sure you not mind me being blind sometimes, I know in the future I might loose what sight I still have”

“You know you are beautiful whichever glasses you wear I would rather you wore these prosthetic eyes if you not wearing your glasses”

“Thank you darling I had not realised how small and closed my eyes looked without glasses on before ,I think because I couldn't see anything I didn't try to make them stay open”
“What is that box the eye doctor gave you”

I told her it was a birthday surprise and she had to wait till next month.
I put her thick bifocal glasses back on her .
