Finding ME part 3


I tidied the house while waiting for my husband secretory to arrive,it would be difficult communicating with her, as I had not found my other hearing aid 

The door light flashed, was it her?


She was tall and slim with short cropped blonde hair,wearing a tight low cut dress and high heels with heavy makeup,and false eyelashes. I'm sure her boobs are false as well.

I handed her the case that my husband had packed.

"My I use your bathroom please"

I could not refuse but wondered why she took
 the case with her.

As she came out of the bathroom she turned and looked at me.

"Sorry I was a long time I had trouble putting these contact lenses in that my boss gave me, they are big and the hard plastic covers all my eye"

"Do I look alright wearing these glasses, it seems strange only seeing through these little circles,I have always hated the thought of ever needing to wear glasses. But my boss has said he expects to see me wearing these when I walk back into to the office later today and I have to wear them all the time if we are going to get married , I'm going to America with him and he has given me a rise"


"Do I still look just as pretty wearing them"

"I'm sure he will be pleased he has this fetish about glasses"

"He said his wife won't wear them now that's why he left her"

"O is that what he said"

"Yes did you ever meet her"


"He said she was away and the cleaning lady would give me the case"


Um,so I was just the CLEANING lady .

“Just a minute he left something else for you"

I went into the bedroom and searched through my bedside draws,I found my big old black hearing aids that I used to wear a long time ago, and put 2 new batteries in them

Wearing them will teach her what life is like being with him.

"Your boss told me I had to give you these and help you put them in"

"What are they"

"Hearing Aids"

,"BUT I DON'T NEED HEARING AIDS"

"AND THEY ARE SO BIG AND UGLY

"I can't be seen wearing them,"

"Only old people wear them,my hair is short and blonde and they are black"
"I'm not deaf, I will look disabled, I can't be seen wearing them"

"O dear I'm sorry madam I'm only doing what he said,I can't let you take the suitcase if you don't wear them,maybe when you get to America you could talk to him about it,and ask him to get you a different colour but if you don't want to go to America it's ok with me,as he said I'm only the cleaner"

Haha to myself

"Ooo I want to please him, he said when we get there we will get married"
"I suppose I could only wear them in the house"

"I don't know madam"
"His wife had to wear them all the time"

"What even when you know what"

“Yes especially then"

"All your friends will have to get used to seeing you like this"

"She once told me he had a fetish about glasses and hearing aids and if she stopped wearing them she thought he would leave her"

"These were her Moulds I have cleaned them well, you will need to get your own moulds made for them later"

" O how the *** do you put these *****  things in,I can't bare looking at them let alone touching the things, ,what will all my friends think"

"It's ok Madam,don't worry. It's like you said I'm only the cleaner ,I will put the case back in the bedroom. Can you see yourself out"

“WAIT, Will you put them in for me please"

"I pushed the mould deep inside her right ear I had chosen the black mounds not the clear ones and the thickest tubing I had, haha.Then I hooked the first hearing aid over her ear,there was no way she could hide them"

"O that feels so strange I can't hear anything out of that ear,I thought hearing aids helped old people hear better "

"After I have fitted the other mould in you you won't hear anything till I turn them on so don't worry"
"This is the on and off switch,you will need get used to turning them off when you get into bed"

"What have you done I can't hear anything, I can see your lips moving but I can't hear anything,PLEASE  turn them on I'm scared"

"Is that better,"

"Yes thank you, but can you turn them up a little I hated not hearing, why does my voice sound so loud in my head when I'm talking 

"Is there a box to keep them in at night"

"No madam you don't understand your boss will want you to keep them in at nights,

"You mean I have to keep these big ugly things in all the time"

"Yes madam he will want you to be totally Deaf when you are sleeping together" 

I had put a little superglue on the edge of the mould and the side of the aids haha she won't be able to get  them out for 2 or. 3 weeks

"Why is everything  still so quite"she said

I slowly turned them up to number five.

"That's better I can hear the TV now,but my voice is so loud inside my head"

 "You will have to get used to that”


"There is a long mirror in the dining room go and have a look,I sure your boss will be pleased"

"Oooooo my god it's so hard to see to walk looking though these 2 tiny circles I can't see anything at the side, I look stupid ,And my beautiful eyes look so small"

"******** ****  These black hearing aids are so big and show so much against my blonde hair ,I used to have longggg hair, and I could have hidden them but my boss said to get it cut short as I would be very hot in America" 

"Is that what he said,I know he likes to see the hearing aids,but Don't worry you will soon get used to people looking at you"

"You mean people will keep STARING at me"

"Well yes, I expect so."You do look very different to when you arrived,your boss has this fetish I'm sure it will be worth it"

"Sometimes you might hear a person say (It a shame that pretty girl has to wear those strange glasses and such big hearing aids,she must be very disabled) just turn your hearing aids down a little then you not hear it"

"There is a coffee shop just up the road from here would you like me to walk there with you and we could have a coffee" 

"Yes please I'm scared to go out on my own and be seen like this"

"Just wait a minute while get my coat,could you hand me my cane please"

"Do you have a bad leg? Is that my you need a cane?,,but why is it white?"

"I'm virtually blind in my right eye and have very poor sight in my left eye.The cane helps me" 

"Shall we go"

"This is hard to see just looking through the 2 little circle.its like looking through a telescope, I can't even see the floor or sideways"


"How did his wife manage?"

"It's just practice I expect”

"You will eventually get used to them,

"I know it must be difficult for a pretty young lady like you to suddenly having to wear glasses,and hearings LIKE THESE for the rest of your life. Just remember never let him see you without them or he will leave you; 

"I think I will keep bumping into people 

"Just a minute I have an idea"
"Here try using this I have a spare cane it Will help"

"NO NO NO I can't be seen using that"


"Ok it folds up I will just put it in your bag for you incase you change your mind when we are outside"

"NO I WON'T CHANGE MY MIND"

"It's so difficult to see sideways I keep bumping into people,why don't they move"

"They don't know you can't see that's why my cane is white”
"Why don't you try using the cane"

,"NO NO NO I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT IT "
 "SO STOP ASKING ME"

"It's ok for you"
"You are a lot older than me,and you are only a cleaning lady, I'm 18 and a fashion model"


"It doesn't matter what you look like". 

"Ouch what was that, I think I have twisted my ankle" 
"Why didn't you trip over it"

"I felt it with my cane"

"O ***** **** it hurts"

"WHERE IS THAT ****** ,CANE I SUPPOSE I'M GOING TO  HAVE TO USE IT"

"Shall we sit outside*

,"NO  NO I can't be seen looking like this ,is there a garden out the back"

"Were is the lady's room I need it urgent it's all this stress"

"It's just beside the back door"

"I will find a table in the Garden"

I had to smile to myself as she made her way to our table"

She was walking slowly, nervously prodding the tables with her cane.
People were staring at her and whispering at each other 

Her eyes looked minute Peering through the tiny 22ml circles in the myodisc lens that  she was now completely dependent upon.
You could not see the long false eyelashes she was wearing,just the faded pink coloured NHS frames and 2 tiny eyes,The smudged eyeliner was running down her face where she had been crying.

The 2 black hearing aids  looked even larger against her short cropped blonde hair than I had expected. My hair was black and so they were not as noticable 
when I used to wear them.

" Hi is that better I have ordered to latte's I hope that is ok"

"Here is the lunch menu card you choose what you want,I will pay"

"Thank you"

"WHY  CANT I SEE TO READ THE MENU CARD"

"WHEN I AGREED TO WEAR THESE *****GLASSES I THOUGH I WOULD SEE NORMALLY

"Here put these on"

*What are they"

,"They are his wife's old reading glasses,did he not explain you need different glasses to read with now"

"You mean if I go out for a meal I have take THESE THINGS with me to read the menu"

"Yes you will need to change them many time like shopping to read the prices and on clothes labels,O and I forgot and to read your phone messages but your boss will enjoy watching you trying to see things and then reluctantly having to keep changing your glasses"
I don't like them they are blue it's not my colour, Why have they got those hooks thing to go around the ears 

"O I suppose that's better, at least I can read it now"
"Can I have the salmon please"
"It so much easier than looking through those 2 little circles,but they are so heavy and everthing beyond you is TOTALLY blurred"

*Here let me put the cord over your head then when you take them off you won't loose them"

*I can see your face much clearer now with these reading glasses on" 


"Why are your glasses so very thick and your right lens is so different to your left"
*AND YOU DON'T HAVE THESE HORRIBLE LITTLE CIRCLES TO LOOK THROUGH"

"Well I'm nearly blind in my right eye and because I don't have the circles in the lens they have to be thick and heavy"
 
"Can I try them please"

"I don't think so. They will be much to strong for you "


"PLEASE ,PLEASE 

"O ok if you really want to,but I must put my reading glasses on first,at least with them on I can see just s little if thing are very close"

"I love these glasses much better than seeing out of the little circles"


"Here is my phone please take a photo of me wearing them so I can ask my boss if he will buy me a pair like yours,if I'm going to have to wear glasses to please him I would rather they were this sort”

"I'm not used to taking photos.That's done now. Turn sideways so he can see the thickness of the lens and your big black hearing aids. I'm sure he will love a picture of them.Now put the others back on the ones with the little circles, That's good all done. How do I save it”

“O I pressed the SEND TO ALL BUTTON button,what is that”

"Can I have my glasses back now please I must go ,your bosses wife has a visitor coming soon and I must tidy the House"

"Bye"
