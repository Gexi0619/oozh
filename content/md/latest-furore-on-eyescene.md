I just noticed the latest furore on Eyescene, you know the usual sort of thing were someone gets upset about being linked to that site and perhaps there was some idiot making stupid comments on their Instagram page.

It struck me that there is scope for a story here. Perhaps someone who is so upset by such attention could be convinced that perhaps it's not such a bad thing really.

Or perhaps not.

Either way, the whole thing has its own fascination.
