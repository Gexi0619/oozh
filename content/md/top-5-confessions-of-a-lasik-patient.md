As some of you know I had Lasik in 2000 at age 41. Here are the top 5 things I noticed or confessions as I call them.
5. Your vision is not as good after Lasik as it was with glasses even though I was 20/20 R and 20/30 L. My left or non dominant eye was left slightly Myopic for reading.
4. Shortly after the procedure I walked into a store and someone asked are you high? I started laughing as it was a bright sunny day and I had simply forgotten to take my sunglasses off because I was still used to wearing glasses full time. We both had a good laugh.
3. While I only had 1 very minor complication which involved my right eye going to 20/25 for about a month night driving is not as good as it was with glasses.
2. What the surgeon's office either didn't know or don't tell you is Lasik only last about 8 to 10 years. I was told at 8 or 9 years out I needed glasses for night driving.
1. Despite only having glasses for 18 years and wearing them for 14 years (only the last 3 or so full time) I actually missed wearing glasses. I was relieved when my Dr. told me in 2013 I could wear my glasses full time. I was wearing glasses more then prescribed and now I didn't have to worry about running into my Dr. around town.
Note I may do an article on who I think should or should not have Lasik. I'm trying to figure out which forum to put it in and I'm leaning towards the psychology forum.
