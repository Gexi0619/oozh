We got in the car and Mike was so excited he didn’t even notice how quiet I was
 
“Babe I haven’t been able to see as good as I could with the trial frame in ages, and you know what the best part is? It always improves when you have the actual glasses. And they’re gonna be so thin, well maybe not that much cause you know the prism correction makes it thick anyways, but still I’m static to actually have that option. I wish surgery wouldn’t be as risky as it is, that would be an amazing option tho…”

All I heard was blah blah blah. I kept thinking about the “wife” thing, did he see me as his wife? Had that word been on his mind before? What did he meant? I do want him to be my husband but this caught me by surprise.
 
“Babe… babe are you listening?” He asked

“Ohh yeah Mike sorry, I got lost in my head” I said
 
“Are you ok? Are you upset I’m getting thiner glasses?” He said
 
“Ohh no honey, I’m glad for you. I know that’s what you wanted and I get to see you and enjoy my super myopic yet perfect guy each morning and at night” Came my response
 
“Then what’s wrong honey? I’ve been talking so much I didn’t realize how quiet you were until now. Are you ok?” He asked
 
“I’m just a little bit surprised about you calling me your wife at Dr. Ss” 
 
“Well, you kinda are don’t you? You’ve been there for me through thin and thick… literally! And I couldn’t love you more than I do.” He said
 
“I know but it is a big deal for me, you know…  I wouldn’t want you just saying that cause we haven’t even talked about it” 
 
“Ohhh I’m sorry babe I guess I should’ve waited a little bit, but now that we’re talking, would you see yourself getting married to me?” He said
 
“I do Mike, I love you. You were my crush, then my boyfriend, then a douche, then my boyfriend again. And you’re the person I’ve loved the most in my whole life. I do have to say I would want to have kids and I don’t know if that fits into your plans. And also I think we should go back to therapy but this time individually. We both have been behaving a little bit in a toxic way and we could benefit from going back to Dr. Charles” I said
 
“I do want to have kids with you Nikki, I love you more than I can say and I’m so sorry I haven’t been the man you needed sometimes. You’re the woman of my dreams, you’re the girl I want to spend my life with and it would make me the happiest guy to marry you someday. But this is not me asking you yet, I’ll make it special, I swear.” He said
 
What a nice way to calm me, his words were everything I ever needed to hear. I loved looking at his eyes crossing inwards and squinting, since the glasses he was wearing didn’t offer full correction. 
 
“We should get the swimming goggles once my glasses arrive honey” Mike said
 
“Are you sure? You said you never wanted to get swimming goggles” 
 
“Well I want to go to the lake again, and who are we kidding? We CAN’T be with our glasses off, so we might as well invest in a really nice pair of goggles and enjoy ourselves” He said
 
WOW! That took me by surprise and got me a little bit exited. 

We got home late so the only thing left to do was have dinner and go to sleep. I helped Mike with the contacts, he knew how to take them out cause he used to wear contacts ALL THE TIME but he loved when I did acts of service for him and this was one of them. 
 
I woke up really early and got myself ready to work. I took a nice relaxing shower, I got a little bit of make up on, made a hot cup of coffee and woke Mike up.
 
“Babe, I have to go to the office today. Do you need anything?” I asked
 
“Uhmmm” he moaned
 
“Babe, wake up It’s 6:30 am I have to go. Do you need anything?
 
“Good morning gorgeous. I only need a kiss please” He said, so I gave him a long nice kiss

“I left everything you need for the contacts routine here on the bedside table alright? I left my spare pair of glasses and maybe you can wear them with the glasses Dr. S borrowed you on top to get a clearer view before you put the contacts in” I said
 
“Thank you so much baby, you’re an angel. Have a nice day! Love you” 

“Love you Mike, if you need anything call me!” I said and left for work
 
I came back late and the routine was pretty much the same, having dinner, me watching greys anatomy and us falling asleep together.
 
The day came and Mike’s glasses were ready, not the actual full prescription glasses… Those were gonna take a long time to make, but the ones he was supposed to wear over the strong contacts. 
 
“Michael! I think you’ll be very happy with the outcome of these glasses. Here, have a seat and Melinda will get you fitted with them” Dr. S said
 
Melinda, the girl that wanted to convince Mike of having the surgery, came to fit him his new glasses and I just got such weird vibes from her…
 
“Wow Michael, you’ve got beautiful eyes. You’ve been told many times right?” She said

“Uhmm thanks. Not that many times actually, but thank you” Mike answered
 
“Ohh well, you do. Mike, can I call you Mike? I think you will really benefit from testing your eyesight with this combo and who knows? Maybe the next step for you will be the lens replacement surgery” She laughed a little
 
Did I say she gave me weird vibes? I meant I didn’t like her, at all. 
 
“I don’t think so. There’s not that much to win an a lot to lose, but thank  you anyway” Mike told her
 
“Ohh well, let me see” she said while taking the borrowed glasses off Mike and placing his glasses instead “Wow these look really nice on you, let me just adjust the earpieces a little bit” Melinda said. She heated the earpieces and bent them a little, then placed the glasses back on him.
“There we go, they look perfect on you. Your eyes already look perfect, don’t get me wrong” She had the balls to say
 
“Thank you, that’s actually a compliment I do hear a lot. My wife (turning his head towards me) always calls me her perfect guy” Mike smiled at me 
 
“You are sweetheart, my perfect guy” I said and this time I was glad he called me that. 
 
Melinda rolled her eyes and called Dr. S so he could ask a couple of questions to Mike. When the process was done we went home. 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 days had passed since Mike got his new glasses and contacts combo and it was a delight for me to have my super sexy blind guy 16 out of the 24 hours of the day. About 8 of those 16 hours we were asleep but the other 8 we had an amazing bath, sex and talk routine going on.

I had to go to the office again and Mike called me to ask if I wanted to go the new French restaurant to have diner. TBH I don’t really like French food but I wanted to have a romantic date with him so I said yes. 
 
I got home and saw Mike wearing a nice grey suit that made him look even better with a black shirt and brown leather shoes that perfectly matched his belt and his glasses.
 
“Wow babe, I didn’t know we were going that fancy. Give me 20 minutes and I’ll be ready ok?” I said
 
35 minutes later I came out of our room wearing a black long dress he loved, high heels, full make up and my glasses (which were black also). We looked so good together!! 
 
“Wooow, you look beautiful Nikki” He said
“Wait till you see me with nothing on” I teased him 
 
We drove to the restaurant and the reservation got us the best table on the place, it had an amazing view. 
I loved the way people looked at us, we looked so good and our glasses were so thick (well mine, Mike’s glasses were super thin).
 
We both had Quiches, onion soup, boeuf bourguignon and a bottle of Chateau Mouton Rothschild wine. 

“Nikki I have a surprise for you” Mike said
“A surprise? What kind of surprise?” I asked
“A nice one I think” he said while taking out a sport glasses case 
I took it, opened it and it was a pair of sports goggles!! 
“I got you those in your prescription. You can actually change the strap to have them being goggles or have them being sport glasses. I thought you’d like them” He said
“Woooow babe!! This is super sweet thank you so much. I love them!!” I took my glasses off and tried the goggles on. They were perfect!!! 
“Also I wanted to say this… Nicole, will you marry me?” He said while kneeling in front of me
“What? Wait wait” I took the goggles off and placed my glasses on “Are you for real Michael??” I said
“Yes, you make me the happiest I’ve ever been. You accept me for who I am and with you I feel safe, I want to be with you for the rest of my life… Will you marry me Nikki?” He asked again
At this point I was already in tears; I thought the goggles were the surprise!! 
“Yes Mike, of course I will marry you!!!” I yelled
People loooooove proposals and this was not the exception, everyone at the restaurant was clapping and a few of them were recording. The restaurant gave us a glass of champagne and a nice discount. 

We went home and of course we celebrated in the only war possible… 
 
We got off the car and started kissing each other hard, the kind of kisses you give someone you truly love and desire. 
 
His big manly hands caressing my butt while we kissed made me mad. He unzipped my dress and took me to the bedroom.
 
“I’ve got another surprise for you baby” He whispered in my ears and kissed my neck leaving a red mark. He got his belt off and made what it seemed like a trap but was more like two handcuffs together and secured me to the bed. Then he went and got two ties and tied my ankles to each side of the bed. 
 
I was so damn exited I was begging him to hurry and I could see him enjoying my begging.
 
“You seem to enjoy watching me being helpless when you bathe me, when you suck me, when we’re fully naked. But you almost never let me see you that way, so tonight is my turn” He said and he proceeded to take my glasses off. 
No need to say I’m absolutely blind without my glasses; my prescription, in case you don’t remember is  O.D.  -26.50  / -1.0 x100 &  O.S. -25.75 / -1.75 x90
“Place them somewhere safe babe, please” I told him
“Shut up, you don’t have permission to talk. I’m in charge right now, understood?” He said firmly
“Yes” I said
“Yes sir” he corrected me
“YES SIR” I yelled
I could hear him taking his clothes off, and it made me so hot and a little bit desperate that I couldn’t even make out his amazing figure. I suddenly felt his big manly left hand caressing my breasts and I could feel his right hand moving back and forth.
I felt his penis moving around my face, and I tried to follow it with my mouth but Mike kept moving it until he pushed it right in. I Couldn’t move that much and I almost throw up but he then moved back and pulled it out. This went on for a while and I thought he was gonna cum right there but suddenly he stopped and went away. 

“Mike?” I asked “Where did you go?” 
… Nothing
“Mike???” 
The lights were so low they made my already almost non existing eyesight worse. All of the sudden I felt Mikes tongue exploring my body and I almost had an orgasm right there. I hadn’t seen him, I thought he was away and it aroused me hard. 

He was the best when it came to the oral sex department and he kept me on the edge for a while, when I was about to burst he stopped with the tongue and pushed his penis into me. WOW what a feeling!! 
I had so many orgasms that night. Mike was by far the best lover I’ve ever had, he was amazing in bed. 
When we finished, he laid next to me and hugged me. I was still tied and couldn’t move but I loved the feeling of him hugging me and running his fingers through my nipples. We fell asleep and I woke up next morning with my numbed arms.
 
“What the…? Mike? Honey?” I said but no response came
“MIKE?!!!!” …. Nothing! 
15 minutes passed by and I got pretty anxious so I started moving till my hands got the belt loose and I undid the ties that trapped my legs. I had sore wrists as well as very numbed arms but in a few minutes I felt good enough to get up. 
Last night was amazing, but where had Mike left my glasses? I felt my way to the bedside tables and I couldn’t find them, I went to the bathroom but nothing was there. I went to look for my spare pair and I couldn’t find those either… Being this blind was no joke. 
I then remembered about the goggles he had given me last night so I went to the living room and I couldn’t find them. I was starting to panic when I thought to myself “Nicole you are a strong woman, you need to calm down cause this is what you wanted” and went to the bathroom.
Knowing your way around your house is really helpful in these situations so I decided to take a nice long bath till Mike came. I couldn’t find the bath bombs so warm water was everything I had. 
I kept my eyes closed and occasionally I opened them cause I got headaches when I had my glasses off for long periods of time. I heard the door:

“Good morning baby, are you awake yet” Mike said
“Michael you left me tied and without glasses!!” I yelled pretending to be mad
“Oh my… I’m so sorry, where are you?” He asked
“Right here, taking a bath” I said
“Ok, I’ve got anoooother surprise so close your eyes” Mike said
“Mike I don’t have glasses. I can’t even see my nose if I try” I said
“Ohhh yeah right, let me get them for you… Now close your eyes” He said “Ready? One, two, three… Open them” 
I did and he was wearing a pair of new super strong glasses. They were lenticulars so I could see a not so small circle right in the middle of the lenses containing his full prescription. 
“So..? What does my fiancée think? Dr. S called and said they were ready and I didn’t want to wake you up” He asked
“Woooooow! You look so good babe, I’m mesmerized!! My gorgeous fiancée” I said
“Oh and wait there’s more…” He took a case like the one from my goggles from the shopping bag he had and proceeded to take his glasses off and put a pair of sports goggles on. 
Those ones looked SO THICK. 

“These are my sports goggles, I really don’t like the thickness but we can exercise together if you want to. A few weeks ago I got your prescription and asked them to make me a pair as well” He said
Right here, right at this moment I knew I was right when I met him for the first time and I thought he was a cool guy. I’m gonna marry the love of my life and he is now in a process to accept he is an extremely myopic man and that makes him perfect… at least for me it does!
