The collector


Jennifer, you are wearing glasses!
I was so surprised, she had never mentioned to me. that she was going to have an eye exam, 
or that she had trouble seeing things clearly.
You sure look nice, wearing glasses, thank you, yes I like wearing glasses, I love my new look..
She let me try her glasses, and I loved the feel of the glasses on my face, what a nice feeling.
Looking through the lenses, my vision was a little fuzzy, then I looked at myself wearing Jennifer’s glasses,
and I loved my glasses look.
That was the day that I decided, I was going to wear glasses.




In our family, only my dad wears glasses, but he only wears them, when he is reading.
How? am I going to going to wear glasses?
Looking at my computer, I found a lot of information, about eye exams, and being prescribed glasses,
Now, I am getting some ideas.
I also read, that if you hold the book you are reading, very close to your eyes, might make you myopic ,
and then, you have to wear glasses, to see properly.
So now, I strain my eyes, as much as possible, when reading, I am holding the book, as close I can.
Sometimes, I get a headache, when reading so close to the page, but I won’t quit, I want to wear glasses.




To day, when visiting Jennifer, she mentioned to me, that she was going to have another eye exam, 
because the doctor had told her, he wanted to check my prescription, after I had been wearing my glasses,
for about six months.
I think, I might get an increase in my prescription, because I have noticed, I can not see as well lately.
Jennifer, can I wear your glasses for a little while, I think, I might need to wear glasses.
Sure, here they are, so I put Jennifer’s glasses on, and noticed that when wearing the glasses, 
now could see everything nice and clear, I might be myopic, like I want to be, so I have to wear glasses.




Jennifer, is wearing her new glasses to day.
I told her how lucky she was, and that I always wanted to wear glasses.
Well, I can give you my old glasses, they are no use to me anymore.
Would you? 
Sure, I will bring them to school to morrow.
That was the day, I started to wear glasses, and when I get my own glasses, Jennifer’s old glasses, 
will be the first pair for my collection.




I wore Jennifer’s glasses, whenever I could, and soon noticed, that I needed to wear the glasses, all the time to see properly.
When I told my mother, I had trouble with my vision, she would not believe me.
I told her I was having a problem, seeing what was written on the blackboard
Well, we will find out, and she arranged for an eye exam.




Having some knowledge, what took place, during an eye exam, and I had an idea, what I should do.




The day of the exam, I was so excited, I am going to wear glasses.
When the doctor asked me to read the lines, I hesitated, and told the doctor, the line was not very clear.
I heard a few clicks, and is this better?
So, I ended up with a prescription, a little stronger than I needed, but that was just fine with me.
My mother could not believe, I have to wear glasses, but she likes the frames, I selected.




Now, I have two pair of glasses, for my collection. my own, and Jennifer’s old glasses.
When Jennifer tried my glasses, she noticed that I have a higher prescription, then hers.
and was surprised, I needed glasses, with that strong prescription.
Reading, the prescriptions, now know, that Jennifer’s first pair, had a – 0.75 prescription.
Her second pair is, -1.00, and my prescription is -1.50.





I love wearing my glasses, and always love looking at other people, who are wearing glasses.
Noticing, that stronger prescriptions, showing rings at the edge of the lenses, made me wish,
my lenses would show rings, and show my facial cut in.
Someday, I am sure , I will wear nice glasses, just like that, with a higher prescription.


Some of my classmates, who wear glasses, know,I have a glasses collection, and
have given me some glasses, I now have seven pair of glasses.




Yesterday, I was at the mall, and as usual, like to visit the optical store.
I look at all the frames on display. and of course, try them, to see how I look.
There was a lady, getting her new glasses, I loved the looks of her old glasses, a pair of nice looking frames, 
with a what looked like a strong prescription. 
I walked out of the store, and was going to get a drink, when the lady who just, was in the store, 
to get her new glasses, came out of the optical store.
She seemed to be in a big hurry, and while walking out of the store, was trying to put her old glasses case in her purse. 
What the lady did not realize was, she missed her purse, and that she had dropped the glasses case.
I noticed the case, and walked over to pick it up .
While I was holding the glasses case, I looked around, to see, if I could see the lady, but could not find her, she was gone.
Now what to do?
I put the glasses in my purse, and went to buy my drink, and sat down to enjoy it.
Being curious, I took the glasses case, and opened it.
What a beautiful pair of glasses, I loved the colour and the shape of the frame.
I took my glasses off, and put the glasses on.
When looking around, I realized the glasses were to strong for me, I could not see very well, wearing them.
I put the glasses back in my purse, and went home.




In my bedroom, I just had to look at myself, wearing the found glasses, wow, I love the look , 
I can see even some rings at the edge of the lenses, and noticed some cut in of my face, looking at the lenses,
I loved how I looked, wearing the frame with stronger lenses.
Now, I want to wear these glasses, all the time.
I started to wear the glasses, at school, and after a few weeks, could see perfectly, wearing the glasses.
Not long after, I had a problem, that I could not see as well, wearing my prescribed glasses, that I had to wear when I was home.
I mentioned to my parents, that I had noticed that, my vision was not as good,
and I think, and should have an eye exam, and get new glasses
Cindy, not right now, you have an eye appointment in another month. 




At my next eye appointment, when I was ready to go to high school, my prescription, was up to -3.75.
the doctor explained to my mother, that when growing taller, myopia usually increases, and to expect more increases,
until I was mature.
My new prescription is almost the same, as the ladies glasses that I have been wearing at school.




To make my glasses collection grow, I am always looking, to find some more.
To day, I walked past an antique store, and I have no idea why I walked into the store, 
but I am glad I did, because when looking around, noticed a small box, with some old glasses.
When going through the box, noticed some old style frames, and some other very interesting glasses.
I asked for a price, and the lady told me the price, and showed me the glasses, her daughter had been wearing.
After counting the money, I had in my purse, I had enough money, to buy six more pairs of glasses.
The lady put them in a bag after I had paid her, and I went home with my glasses.




When, at home I looked at the glasses I had bought, noticed that that the glasses, her daughter had been wearing,
had quite a high prescription.. 
When I tried the glasses, everything I looked at, was very blurry.
I wish, I knew, the prescription of the glasses, the lady’s daughter, sure is a high myopic.




A few weeks later, I went back to the second hand store, to have another look at the glasses.
When I entered the store, a glasses wearing young lady, which I guess was the daughter.
She is wearing glasses, which made her eyes look very small, because of the strong prescription.
I mentioned to her, that I had bought some glasses a couple of weeks ago.
My name is June, I remember my mother telling me, that you purchased a couple of my old glasses.
Yes, I have a glasses collection, and I am always looking, for a pair that is different.
I would like to look, at the little box again, to have another look.
Well, I just put a couple pair of my recent glasses in there, they have -15.00 , and -16.00. prescriptions.
My new glasses have a -20.00 prescription.
I looked at June’s glasses, and wonder what it would be like, to wear a prescription that high.
After buying some more glasses, and a pleasant conversation with June, I went home.
My collection of glasses is growing, now I would like to find a way, to find out, what prescription strength they are.
That will be soon, because I am going to be an optician.




The two year course to become an optician, and contact lens fitter, went fast.
I still like to visit the antique store and talk to June, and buy some more glasses.
June and I are becoming friends, we get along well, and we both of have a glasses fetish.




I now am an optician, what a pleasure, to work with glasses, and looking after a person’s vision problems.
At my last eye exam, my prescription, did not increase, and is -7.50.
With that prescription and Inow, can wear different frames, to go with my outfit.




Today, when I met with June , she told me her parents had retired, and had given her the store.
I have, a large apartment over the store, and wonder if you would like to move in with me?
I accepted, now I can walk to work, and I like June, so I moved.






Chapter 2, is coming.
