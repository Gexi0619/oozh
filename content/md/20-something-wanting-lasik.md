A couple of years ago while in a large breakroom at work I used water and paper towels to clean my glasses. Chris a 20 something college graduate who was not wearing glasses asked if I would consider Lasik? I told Chris yes and in fact I did have the procedure done in 2000 but my vision had changed and I had to start wearing glasses again now full time. Chris mentioned he would like to have Lasik so naturally I thought he was wearing contacts. Chris said he had been prescribed glasses in college for night driving which he was having trouble with and if needed for seeing far away in school and was not wearing contacts. I told Chris I didn't think he was anywhere near bad enough for Lasik based on my experience. Chris did say he had to renew his drivers soon and wondered if he would pass the vision screening without glasses. About 2 weeks later Chris came in and said he had passed the vision screening without glasses but still wanted Lasik even if the procedure only lasted 8 to 10 years as was now common knowledge the big money was worth it. I have not seen Chris in quite a while since he transferred to a different department on another shift but I wonder if he has thought about Lasik anymore?
