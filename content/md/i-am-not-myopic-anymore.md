I am not myopic anymore.






I have a sister, Jenny, who is a year older than I am.
Jenny is so different than I am, in what she likes and dislikes, but we love each other.
Both my parents, are low myopic, and wear glasses, and they make sure we have our annual eye exam.
Jenny started to wear glasses, last year, she is myopic, and hates having to wear glasses.
I don’t know why she does not like to wear glasses, she looks great wearing glasses, 
and I can’t wait for my next eye exam, and be prescribed to wear glasses.






I love the looks of glasses, and I know I will look good wearing them.
Because there are some old glasses from my parents, I have been trying to wear a few of them.
I can’t see to well, when wearing most of the glasses, but I was lucky, and found a pair, 
that I wear, when I am alone. 
If I wear the glasses long enough, I can see perfect.
I love it when I remove the glasses, and everything in the distance looks fuzzy, I like that.
Lately, I noticed that my distant vision is not very good anymore, I am sure I am myopic now.
I can’t wait for our next eye exam, and get my own glasses,


When we had our eye exams, the optometrist told me that she was concerned about the change in my vision.
I am myopic now, and she gave me my prescription, which read O.D- 2.00 , O.S -1.75, and to make sure,
to wear my glasses, and to come back, in about 6 months, to check the prescription.
My mother was surprised, about me getting a prescription that high, for my first pair of glasses.
I love it, the stronger the better, I like the looks of lenses, that show depth, rings, and some facial cut in.


At my next eye exam, my prescription increased 1/2 diopter, and a new pair of glasses.
I am due for another eye exam in about 6 to 8 months, to check my prescription.




What a surprise, we have a new student in our class. 
Katie’s parent have just moved in to our town, I would like to make her my friend, she is my type.
A good looking, high myopic, glasses wearing girl.
It was easier than I had expected, 
At lunch time, I had a chance to sit with Katie, and we had a pleasant talk, and I invited her to come
over for a visit.




When Katie and I got together, we realized, we both like the same things.
When we started to talk about glasses, she told me that he present glasses prescription, is about -7.00. 
and she expects an other increase at her next eye exam.
Both my parents are high myopic, so I expect more increases in my prescription.
I had the chance to try her glasses, but they were far to strong, 
Sandy, you and I like high prescription lenses, and am sure, you like wearing higher prescription glasses.
I have some of my older glasses, you can try to wear them, if you want, so you can induce more myopia.
Yes, I sure would like to try the glasses, when I am at your place..



I am all excited, when I was going to Katie’s house for a visit, because I knew, I get a chance to try some higher prescription glasses.
After, saying hello, to Katie’s parents, we went to Katie’s bedroom,.
What a surprise, when I saw that Katie, had displayed all her glasses, on top of her dresser.
You noticed I am ready for you.
So much fun, trying all those glasses.
After trying all the glasses, several times, I made the decision, that I like to wear, Katie’s old – 4.00 glasses.
The -4.00 glasses gave me reasonable vision, and I am sure, it won’t be long that I will be able to see perfect ,
wearing the – 4.00 glasses.
I wore the glasses while we talked and played some games.
After a while I noticed that my vision, wearing the glasses, had improved, but I was also having a head ache.
Examining the case that the – 4.00 glasses had been in, was the prescription for the glasses.
On the way home, I wore my own glasses, and by the time I came home, my head ache was gone. 




After I came home, went to my room, and put Katie’s glasses back on, and not long after, started to get a headache again.
I sure was not very happy, now I had glasses with the prescription I like, but have trouble wearing them.
I was mad, when I put the glasses away, and wore my own again.
Knowing, that there was a reason, for my headaches wearing the – 4.00 glasses, I took some time, to look at the computer,
about eye exams, and prescriptions.
Now I think, I know what the problem is.
After finding the glasses case for my glasses, I opened it and found the prescription. for my present glasses.
I compared it to the prescription for the – 4.00 glasses and realize, that both the axis, and cylinder, are very different,
so now I know what caused the headache wearing the -4.00 glasses.
What to do now?
Well, if I had contact lenses, I might be able to induce more myopia.
Now, I have to find out more about contact lenses, and the best place, that I can think of, is the Optical store.




When I went to the optical store, I told the optician, that I would like to start wearing contact lenses.
Do you have a prescription? 
Yes, I do I had my eyes examined here.
The optician checked on the computer, and soon found my prescription.
First thing the optician did, was to explain to me the care and maintenance of contact lenses, and how important it is, 
to keep the lenses clean.
She took all the measurements of my cornea and my lens, to get the proper size lens for me.
Then she explained, how to insert and remove the lenses., and handed me a lens.
After a few tries, I was able to insert, and remove the lenses, and now feel more confident, about trying to wear contacts.




I am glad to see you are so good handling contact lenses, and before you order any, I will give you a few, 
so you can get used to wearing the contact lenses, and see how you like wearing them. 
Then she handed me a small box with -2.00 lenses.
I would like to see you again, in about two weeks, for a check up’
I wore the contact lenses going home, and found, that wearing the lenses, is more comfortable then I had expected.
.
When I came home, my mother asked me, why I was not wearing my glasses?
I am wearing contact lenses.
Where did you get them? 
At the optical store, the optician showed me how to insert and take the lenses out, and gave me a few,
to wear, to see if I like to wear contact lenses.
How are you going to keep wearing contacts, I am not buying them for you, there is nothing wrong ,with wearing glasses.
I will save my allowance, and buy the lenses on line.
Well I hope you know, what you are doing.




Now that I had the measurements, I checked the places, where I could buy lenses on line.
When I started my order was asked for a prescription, which I had but upped my sphere to - 4.00.
After filling out all the other details, my order was completed, and will be send to me.
Now I could not wait, for the delivery.




A few days later, my contact lenses arrived.
I was all excited when I opened the package, so I could, try wearing the higher prescription contacts.
After inserting the new lenses, I looked around, and was pleasantly surprised, that I could see reasonably well.
There was no problem wearing the stronger prescription all the time, because my family,
was used to see me wearing contact lenses.


Soon I was able to see perfect wearing the – 4.00 lenses. I would like to order some stronger lenses right now, 
but I am due for an eye exam, and I will wait till after the exam. 




I sure do not like to wear my glasses now, my sight is prefect wearing my contacts.
The day I was due for my eye exam, I wore my glasses, and when the doctor gave me my prescription, was so happy
I need – 4.00 glasses, and now can wear a nice new frame, because I love wearing glasses.




I love my new - 4.00 glasses, and I am looking forward, to get an even stronger prescription next year, 
after I order some – 6.00 contact lenses. 
But sometimes, things do not work out as expected.




Mother and I are going to the mall to day, to do some shopping.
However on the way to the mall, a car ran the red light, and we had an accident.
At that time, I had tried to get something out of my purse, and was slightly bent forward, when the cars collided
When the airbag was activated, it hit me in the face, and knocked me out.
The paramedics, transported me to the hospital emergency.
When I slowly woke up, realized, I had trouble seeing.
A nurse came over, and said well I am glad to see you woke up, how are you feelig?
I have trouble seeing, 
Yes we realize, you might have a problem, with your vision.
By the looks of it the air bag hit you, at your fore head and eyes, and we have a specialist coming to have a look at you.




Hello Sandy, I am Dr. Jones and want to have a look at your eyes.
He shone a light into my eyes, and mentioned that he would like to have an other look at my eyes to morrow,
and hopes, some of the swelling around my eyes might have gone.




The next day ,the nurse assisted me to get dressed, and put in in a wheel chair, and took me to the optical wing.
Dr. Jones, had pictures taken of my eyes, and now was looking in to my eyes again.
Sandy, I am sure we can fix your vision up like new, after the procedures, I am planning.
I will talk to your parents before we go ahead.




Dr. Jones talked to my parents, who then signed a consent form, so he could proceed with the treatment.




All I remember is, that Dr. Jones , if I am sure, used a laser, to do the procedure.
Sandy, I think, you will be happy , your vision will be near normal, and we will arrange for an eye exam, 
in a couple of days, after the swelling around your eyes is almost gone. 




To day, I had my eye exam, and was told I have to have, some astigmatism correction, and l have to wear glasses.
When I looked at my prescription, I noticed the sphere showed + 3.00 .
The next day when I got my new glasses, and put them on, was not happy, with my distant vision.
When I looked at myself in the mirror, noticed my eyes looked larger.
I am so upset, I am not myopic anymore.
