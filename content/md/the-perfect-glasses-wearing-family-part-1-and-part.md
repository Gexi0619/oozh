The perfect, family. part 1


Jim, and I, Katie, met in university, and it was love at first sight.
We were married, after we graduated, and both now have a good job.
Jim, is very handsome [well I think he is] an athletic figure, and dark hair.
I, am a strawberry blonde, brown eyes, not too tall, with a good size bust line, good figure, and nicely shaped legs.
We are new citizens in this city, and for that reason, we know only a few people, and have no real friends.
After joining a church group, of young married couples, we met a few interesting people.
Kevin and Kim, are a couple, we would like to be friends with.
Just before, we were informed that there would not be any more meetings, till fall, I got a chance to talk to Kim, and asked her if she would mind, to exchange phone numbers, so I could call her and have a chat, so we get to know each other, she told me she would like that very much.
We exchanged numbers, and I told her, I would call her in about 3 weeks, after returning home, from our vacation, she told me she will be looking forward to that call..


For our summer vacation, we spend a week, at a resort..
In the dining room we had a table, just for the two of us. 
After we had finoished our breakfast, Jim was busy going through all the literature, about attractions, and interesting things to see, and do in the area, while we were having our coffee.
While I was looking around, the table across the isle caught my attention.
A family of two girls and a boy, all in the age range from 7 to 12 years old, well dressed and groomed were with their parents.
What really caught my eye, was, that all of them, wore glasses, the girls looked adorable, the boy studious and handsome, all of them, including the parents, looked very attractive wearing glasses.
I never before had ever seen, a whole family, where all of them , wore glasses.
What really impressed me was, that all of them looked so attractive wearing glasses.
I was so surprised, being attracted to them, what was it? 
The glasses, or that they looked, to me, like the perfect family.
I mentioned it to Jim, and after he had a good look said, I can t believe, how nice they all look wearing glasses, the kids look so nice wearing glasses, it looks to me, like a beautiful, perfect family.


Jim, and I went sight seeing, he would point at something in the distance, and most of the time, I did not have a clue, what I was looking for, certainly not anything that I could see.
The weather was nice, and we were having a nice relaxing vacation.
We almost hated to go home, and get ready to go back to work.


After returning home, when I had managed, to get back into my regular routine, I had a chance to phone Kim, and have a chat.
After talking to Kim for a while, realized we had a lot in common.
We both, like shopping, cooking, and are very fashion conscious, also, both our husbands love playing, cribbage, and sports. 
We arranged to get together, at our place on Saturday night.
Kim, is a beautiful woman, with natural blonde hair, beautiful blue eyes, a good figure, 
and a big smile.
When Kim, and Kevin arrived, it soon seemed to me, as if we all had known each other, for a long time.
The men got along just fine, having a beer, while they were playing their favorite game.
We had a very pleasant evening, and we made arrangements, to go to Kim and Kevin 's place next Saturday,


Kim phoned me, at work to day, and asked me if I could meet her at the mall food court, about 7 to night?
I told her, I would be there.
When I came home from work, made supper, and told Jim about meeting Kim.
Jim, said that's O K , I was going to watch a football game to night. 
So I took the bus to the mall, to meet Kim..


When I arrived at the food court, saw Kim, and walked over to her table and sat down.
What 's up?
Katie, I did not tell Jim yet, but I failed the drivers vision test, to day, and won t get my license until, I go back there, wearing glasses.
I just had an eye exam, and I need you to help me select a frame. I am so upset, I don t know how to tell Kevin, and wonder, what he will say, when he sees me wearing glasses.
I told Kim, about the family, I had seen, while on vacation, and after looking at work at people who wore glasses, and how good you can look wearing glasses.
I am sure you will look fantastic wearing glasses, Kevin will love your new look.
Katie, why don t you get an eye exam to, perhaps, you need to wear glasses, and the boys might accept it easier, if we both wear glasses.
I have no idea, what Kevin will say, when he sees me wearing glasses.
Well, I am glad, I have perfect vision, and have no idea, what Jim would say, if he saw me wearing glasses.
Kim, let s go to the optical store, and have a look, and find you a nice pair of glasses.
When we walked in to the store, Kim told the optician, that I needed an eye exam, how fast can she get one?
Well you are in luck, I just had a cancellation, and we can give her an exam right now.
So, want to, or not, me and my perfect vision, was going to have my first eye exam.


I told the optometrist, I had perfect vision, and had the exam, just to please a friend.
A few minutes later, the optometrist asked me, do I drive at night?
I told him, I did not, my night vision was not very good.
Then, he asked me to read a line of letters
No wonder, I could not read all the letters he showed me, how could I, they looked fuzzy.
I heard some clicks, and was asked, which is better 1or 2, all the way up to 10.
Then the optometrist turned the lights, back on, started to write, and gave me a piece of paper.
Here is your prescription, you need to wear glasses, all the time, you are myopic, just hand it to the optician, she will look after you.
Me, wearing glasses, I can t believe it, my vision, is perfect.


When, I walked out of the examination room, and Kim saw me, carrying my prescription, said great,
I am so glad to see, that you, also need to wear glasses.
I was not a happy camper, I had no idea, what I would look like wearing glasses, and what Jim s reaction would be, seeing me wearing glasses?
The optician was very helpful, and after looking at our face shape, would hand us some frames to try, to see what we looked like wearing the frame.
I was so surprised, how glasses changed my looks, but after a while realized, I did look pretty good, wearing some of the frames.
Kim, has the perfect face, to wear glasses, she looks terrific, and it did not take her long, to find the perfect two frames, as there was a 2 for 1 sale.
At last, I am satisfied with my selections, and after the optician, took our measurements, told us the glasses would be ready for pick up on Saturday.


All the way home, we were wondering, how to start wearing the glasses, in front of our husbands,
and what kind of reaction we might get.
We decided, there is no use worrying about, it right now, we had till Saturday, to find a solution,
and we were sure, one of us would come up with, a good idea, of how their glasses wearing wives looked.


When, I went to work, the next day, I was bothered by an upset stomach, but later in the day, it settled down.
That night at home, Jim, told me about the receptionist at work, that she was wearing new glasses to day, and how attractive she looked wearing glasses.
I agreed, that glasses, sure can change a persons look for the better.
Good, Jim noticed and appreciates an attractive, glasses wearing person.
The next morning, when I had a shower, noticed, my breasts were more sensitive, and a little later, my stomach, did not feel to good, so I skipped breakfast.


I talked to Kim tonight, she has told her husband about failing the vision test, for her drivers license.
His reaction was, well, you might need to wear glasses, just for driving, no big deal, your insurance at work will cover the cost.
We decided, it might not be to bad, the only thing was, that now, we both are supposed to wear our glasses, from when we get up in the morning, till we go to bed at night.
What will our husbands reaction be, when they see both of us wearing glasses?


Saturday came, and we both were wondering, what the day would bring.
Early, in the afternoon, Jim, took me to Kim s place.
When Kim and I left, we asked the boys if they wanted Pizza, or Chinese food.
We were asked, to bring home the Chinese food
.
Two, very nervous girls, walked into the optical store.
Our glasses, were ready, and after a few small adjustments, we were two glasses wearing girls.
We went to the food court, sat down, and looked around.
So much, for my perfect vision, I could not believe the difference in my vision, wearing the glasses.
Kim s reaction was the same.
We looked at each other, I guess they were right, we sure needed to wear glasses.
Well, we both are satisfied with our new look.
Now, the real problem, how to show the glasses, to our husbands, who have no idea, that we are coming home, wearing glasses.,
We will have to think some more, about the right presentation.
Of course, we had to try each others glasses, and decided, I have the stronger prescription, and that we both look good, wearing glasses.

I mentioned to Kim, about not feeling to well the last few days, and my tender breasts.
Katie, have you considered, you might be pregnant?
Me, pregnant?
Thinking back, I now remember, the day we saw the glasses wearing family, Jim sure was in the mood
that night.
We checked at the drug store, and bought a pregnancy test.
Kim, suggested, I do the test, and then, get it confirmed by a doctor, before I tell Jim. 
We decided, it was time, to pick up the Chinese food, and go home, and fill our husbands stomachs, before we are going to have a fashion show, with both of us showing them, our new glasses.
