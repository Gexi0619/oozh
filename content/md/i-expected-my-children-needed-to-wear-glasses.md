Surprising, what can happen, during a pandemic.


I asked my husband to day, what he thought about the virus outbreak in China.
He told me, he is worried, that it might effect, the whole world, which would be a disaster.
Being the mother of four young children, you worry about things like that.
We have two girls, Amy, is 10 and Jenny, who is 6 years old, the two boys, are Logan, who is 12, and Kenny,.who will be 8, in a couple of weeks.
Fortunately they are all healthy, and are good students, and they all love outdoor sports.


Both, my husband and I are myopic, he is in the minus 6 range, I at my last exam was -4.50.and because we are both myopic, I understand, that it is heritable , I know my grand mother was myopic., so was my mother.
My sister who also wears glasses for myopia, has three myopic children.
To make sure, all our children's vision is well looked after, we have an eye exam, every year, and our next exam is in about 3 weeks.
I think, none to soon, because I have seen signs of myopia, in both, Logan and Amy.


Like my husband suspected, the virus was spreading fast, and not long after into our country.
Strong measures have been taken, one was to close all the schools, to stay indoors, and stay at least 1 1/2 meters, from any person you might meet, and to stay home.
My husband, is now working from home,
To stay safe, we order our groceries, by E mail, and pick them up the next day.
The worst part is, on a nice sunny day, the kids want to go the park and the playground, and you have to tell them, sorry, you cannot go to the park.
Fortunately, I had bought a lot, of second hand books, and other books ,where they can follow the number, and other games, hoping to keep them busy,


What worries me, is that they do not get out, in the sunshine, and fresh air, and our yard is not big enough, for playing games.
Unfortunately, I have no idea, how they are being educated to day, the old fashioned way, that I am taught, won't do, so that makes home teaching, for me more difficult.
All of our children, like reading, most of the time, when not reading, they play games on their laptops
I know enough about myopia, that it hereditary, close reading, and lack of sunshine, usually are , other major causes, to induce myopia.
Well, we will have to wait and see.
Unfortunately, they were all due for their annual, eye exam, in a few weeks, which of course is now on hold.
A couple of weeks later, we were informed, that all the children will be taught on line, at least that will occupy them, part of the time.
and they will be able, to keep up with their school work.
All of them doing so much close up work, I hear complaints, that they have a headache 
That night, I discussed it with my husband, and told him, I was very concerned, about the children's vision. 
He suggested, because we cannot have our eye exams, I get in touch, with Jim, next door, for some suggestions, I know he has a lot of knowledge about vision, he told me, vision and glasses, are his favorite hobby, 
He collects glasses, equipment and anything, that has to do with vision.


After I talked to Jim's wife, and told her my concerns, she assured me that Jim, will be glad to help, you, he knows quite a bit about vision, we are a glasses wearing family, and he loves it.


The next day Jim called. and asked, if it was all right, for him to come over, and talk to me, and my husband.
I told him we would be wearing masks, just to be sure. he agreed, and would be over shortly.
When he came, I told him about my concern, the vision of our children, and them missing their eye exam, and that I was sure, some of them should be wearing glasses.
I will be able to help you, I have always, been fascinated by vision and glasses, and have learned a lot, about vision and lenses.
Lately, I have bought, some real good, used optical instruments, including trial glasses and lenses, if you want me to, I can find out how good your children's vision is, and look after it, for the time being, until they get a professional exam, when this mess has cleared up.
I can give them only, a visual exam, 
Well, that would be wonderful, it will sure make me feel better, to know, that their vision is looked after.
I will need, to use your garage if possible, it would be the best place.
I would like, to have the patient, about 20 feet, which is about 6 meters from the wall chart.
I can do a visual, but not an eye health exam, and most likely, I can loan you glasses, that will be close to their prescription, if glasses are needed, which should help them for the time being. 
My husband said, that will be great, I will have the garage, ready for you to morrow morning.


The following morning, Jim came, to set up his equipment. 
He hung a Snellen chart on the wall, placed a chair, in the proper place, and then placed his box of lenses, and trial glasses on a table, and told us he was ready.


Jim, was glad, that he had a chance to use all his equipment, at last.
He had always wanted to be an eye doctor, but because of circumstances beyond his control, had not been able to continue his studies. 


Amy was first, after she sat down, Jim asked her to read the lines, on the wall chart, first with the right, and then left eye ,while he covered the other eye
She read down to the fifth line, when she complained, that the letters were hard to read, 
Jim fitted the trial glasses, on her, and inserted a -3/4 lens. for her right eye, she told him now she could read, that line, and even the one below it.
Then, had to put a - 1.00 in, for her left eye, to get the same results.
Then she was able to read down to line 7
Logan was next, his prescription was O.D - 150, O.S. - 1,25.
Kenny was next, and was -.50. on both eyes, Jenny's vision is border line for any correction.
I asked Jim to check my vision, and he came up with, the same prescription, as I had received the last time I had my eyes examined, which made me feel so much better, now, that my children will be wearing glasses.

Jim, discussed with us, what he had found, that both Logan, and Amy should be wearing glasses, and wanted to know, if they wanted Kenny to start wearing glasses, since he was a low myopic, or wait till he got a professional exam.
We decided, that if he had the proper glasses, for all three children, to please go ahead, I had watched Jim do the exam, which I thought was very professional, and knew he could do only the vision, but not the eye health exam.


Jim went home and went, through his large collection of used glasses. to find the proper prescriptions, he also tried to find a suitable frame, for each child.
Amy was the easiest, because her prescription, was identical to his daughter Kelley's first prescription.
For Logan, he found a frame, with the right prescription, that he was sure Logan would like., and also found a frame with the right prescription for Kenny.
Jim, was glad he had spend the time, after purchasing, a used lensometer, to check, all his 90 plus glasses, and mark them with their prescription. 


Jim came over, the next day, with the glasses, and all of them, are so happy with their improved vision, and even like the frames.
We both, thanked Jim, for all his efforts, that we are so happy, to know, that the children are looked after, for the time being.
Jim, then told us, he was so happy, to get the opportunity to play doctor, that what he had always wanted to do, but did not happen.Â
