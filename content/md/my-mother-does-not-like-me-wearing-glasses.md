My mother, does not like me wearing glasses !






When, you are growing up, your mother usually, makes you do, what she thinks, is best for you.
When, I grew up, I took, ballet and dancing lessons, a self improvement course, how to walk, sit, apply make up, and anything, to make, me a prefect young lady.
Corey, is my name, I am, at an age, that my body, has developed, in all the right places.
I love the looks, of my body, showing some nice curves, and I love my dark blond hair. 
After the summer, I will be going into my second year, of high school, and I am looking forward to it..
My best friend is Amy, we have been friends for a long time.


To day, when I was visiting Amy, she told me that she is due, for her yearly eye exam.
I don’t know, why, I have to go every year, I can see just fine, but my mother told me, because she is myopic, expects,,that her children will be myopic to. 
So far, me and my two younger sisters, are not wearing glasses.
Do you, want to come with me? Just you and I, Cindy, and Sadie had their eye exams, last week
Sure, I like to come with you.


We took the bus, to go to the optical clinic, and we enjoyed the day out, just, the two of us..
At the optical store, Amy, did not have to wait long, to get her eye exam started.
In the mean time, I looked at all the frames, on display, and tried some on.
There sure are, some fantastic looking frames available now, and I like the way I look, wearing some of the frames.
I was so busy, trying the frames, and looking at myself, that I was really surprised, when Amy spoke to me, and told me, that she loved the looks of the frame, I was wearing, 
Corey, those frames look fantastic on you, are you going to get them?
Amy, you know, I don’t need to wear glasses, and I know, my mother would not like, to see me wear glasses.
Corey, will you help me select a nice frame for me, I have to wear glasses..
Amy, try some of these frames, I think they will look great on you, 
It certainly did not take us very long, to find Amy, a suitable frame, that will look great on her..
The optician told us, the glasses would be ready in about an hour


On the way home, wearing her new glasses, Amy kept telling me, all that she could see clearly now, and that she could not believe, her vision had been that poor.
She looks great wearing glasses, and now, she is glad she has to wear glasses, she loves her improved vision, and likes her new look.


Both Amy and myself, are involved with many of the high school clubs.
At the dances, we are always well occupied.
I have noticed, that lately, I like to look at glasses wearing girls, and now realize, 
I like girls better than boys.
Lately, I have, turned down, a lot of dates with boys, boys are to aggressive. 
Amy told me the other day, I need another girlfriend.


Amy, went for her 6 month eye exam, and had an increase in her prescription, and now wears her new glasses.
When I was at Amy’s place, I asked her what she was going to do, with her old glasses?
Why ? Do you want them?
Yes, I would like to, I have tried your glasses a few times, and I now realize, I need to wear glasses, but if I can have your old glasses, I can wear them at school, so my mother does not know.
So, now I am wearing Amy’s old glasses, whenever I can.


My mother, suggested, I get my drivers license, which was fine with me, I know, I will flunk the vision test, and I will have to get my own glasses.


When applying for my license, I failed the eye test, as I had expected
My mother was very upset with me, flunking the vision test !
What was wrong with me?


Well, to day, I had my eye exam, and I will be a full time glasses wearer, I love it, my mother hates it.
My prescription is -1.50, and -1.75, I love my improved vision, and my new look


When, I started university, my prescription was was in the -4.50 . range.,
I love wearing glasses, and my new lenses, look so nice, and I can see everything, so nice and clear..


When at university, I met my kind of girl, a sweet glasses wearing girl.
Jennifer, is in my class, and we like to study, and spend a lot of time together.
Jenny, is also myopic, and wears, - 7.50 prescription glasses, she looks fantastic, and I love her.
We are both in our final year, and plan to move in together, after graduation.


After my last eye exam, my prescription went up to -5.50, and now, I can see, perfect again.


My mother lately, has been asking me, where is your boyfriend?
Mother, I have been busy studying, and have not met a boy yet, that i like. 
What, I did not know, was that she had lined up a man , that she thought, would be perfect for me.


I told Jennifer, that my mother was pushing me, to get married.
Well, perhaps we should get married, but by the sound of it, if we did that, she will disown you.
My mother wants grand children, but my 2 brothers should be able to do that for her.
Well, I am not going to worry, about that, right now, my studies for our finals, are more important.


I came home for the weekend, and that night, my mother asked me to get ready, to go out for dinner, your dad and I are due for a fancy night out.
I got all dressed up, and looking at myself, in the mirror, and was very satisfied, the way I looked.
After we were seated at a fancy restaurant, my mother said, Corey, do you have to wear your glasses, why don’t you take those strong looking glasses off, you look so much prettier, without your glasses.
Mother, I can’t see across the room, without my glasses, so my dad said, why don’t you do, what your mother asked, your plate is right in front of you.
What is going on ?
I cannot remember the last time, they asked me to be bare faced.
Reluctantly, I took off my glasses, and put them beside my plate.
I felt like a blind person, everything I looked at was fuzzy, however, like my dad had said, I could see my plate.
After a drink, I heard my dad say, hello Kevin, would you like to join us?
All I heard , yes, that would be nice, and all I could see was the fuzzy outline of a man.
I tried to find my glasses, but they were not, where I had placed them.
After the introduction, Kevin,, told me how nice and attractive I looked.
To be polite, I thanked him for the compliment, 
There is something wrong here, it looks to me, like a set up.
Then the conversation started, Kevin, said he was sorry, to be late, but he had trouble putting his contacts in.
Kevin, you wear contact lenses? My mother asked.
Yes, I am myopic, but I refuse to wear glasses, I hate the sight of glasses.
After all that, I had lost my appetite, and just picked at my food, If and when I could find it


Corey, your father and I want to make it, an early night, 
Kevin told me, he will give you a ride home, and then you two, can also, do some dancing, the music is about to start..
That sure, was a challenge, no glasses ,and I had no idea, what Kevin even looked like, and then to be stuck with him, for the rest off the night.
We had another drink, that I really did not want, and when the music started, Kevin asked me for a dance, and escorted me to the dance floor.
He sure was no dancer.
Kevin do you like dancing? I don’t know, this is my first time..
Well, if you don’t mind, I like to go home.
I suggest, we should finish our drink, and then, you can Just follow me, my car is in the parking lot someplace..
I finished my drink, and then followed the fuzzy, outline of a man, and I heard, yes, here it is, 
Go around ,to the other side, and I will open the door for you.
I managed to get seated, and I fastened my seat belt.
Leaning back, in the seat, I started to feel light headed, and wanted to go to sleep.
Kevin, talked, about wanting to marry me, and I remember telling him, to forget about that.
Then I went to sleep, or passed out, but, I sure, got a rude awakening, when I realized, I was laying on my back, while he was, having sex with me, 
I was all wet between my legs,
I told him to get of me, and hit him as hard as I could.
Not, till I am finished.


Kevin, while he got into the drivers seat, to drive me home, said, Corey you sure, are not much fun


The next morning, I asked my mother for my glasses. 
Last night, I had managed to find my dresser drawer, and I had found, my old glasses to wear, so I could see, 
Here are your glasses Corey, 
You left your glasses lying on the table, so I put the in my purse, I also think, you should start to wear contacts, Kevin does not like the looks of glasses.
Your dad, told me that he is a very good employee and your dad likes him.
Mother, please don’t mention Kevin, I hate him, and I am going back to university to day, and I won’t be home again, till after my final exams.


When I got settled in my room, I told Jennifer, about my night out.
She could not believe, how my parents, had planned all that.


I missed my next period, but with a lot of studying to do,, I did not pay to much attention to it.
My mother has phoned me a few times, asking when I would be coming home, for the weekend.
I told her. not until I finish writing my final exams, in about 7 or 8 weeks.


There is something wrong with me, and I have no idea what it might be, so I went to the medical clinic.
What a shock, I got, when I was told, Corey, you are pregnant, and received 
instructions, how to look after myself.


When, I told Jennifer, she said, now we can get married and have a family.
Jennifer, I think, that is a good idea.
That way, I will be married, and my mother, will have a grandchild. 


Jennifer how do your parents feel, about you marrying me ?
They are expecting it, they know I am a lesbian.


I notified my mother, that when I come home, I would like to get married, in a small ceremony, next Saturday, and the groom, will be coming home with me, Friday night.


We both finished our exams, and past with honours, and we both have a nice job,, to go to, in the same city, and we are looking forward, moving there, right after our wedding, to a nice apartment.


I met Jennifer’s family, and both her myopic parents are coming to the wedding.


Now, we are ready, to surprise my parents.


AND WE DID!!!


When we came home, first thing my mother asked, where is your future husband?
Right here, mother, meet Jennifer.
I mean a man.
Mother ,we are lesbians, and we want to get married, because I am pregnant, and you will have a grandchild, like you always wanted.


How did you get pregnant?


You remember, the night out, with Kevin, well he spiked my drink, and seduced me, that is how I got pregnant.


My parents, were speechless, they could not believe, that a nice boy like Kevin, would do a thing like that.


The wedding, as I had requested, was going to be on Saturday, Jennifer’s parents arrived on Friday, and I had them meet my parents
The wedding went as planned, and we did not waste any time, to go, to our nice apartment, and settle down, and enjoy married life.
In another week we start our new jobs.


Our jobs, turned out better then we had hoped for, and we are enjoying, our 
married life.
My parents, have been visiting, with us, a few times, I think mostly to keep an eye on my pregnancy.




We had our nursery all ready, when I delivered a baby girl, and named her Sadie.


7 years later.
Sadie is going into second grade this year, and at her yearly eye exam, was prescribed to wear glasses, for myopia, as I had expected.
She looks like a little lady, wearing her – 1.25 glasses, and is very proud of her glasses
.When, my mother, saw her for the first time, wearing glasses, was not happy, 
Glasses at that age ? 
What are you doing to my grandchild?
Mother, I did, what every good mother does, have them wear glasses, so they can 
see, and learn properly.
Jennifer, and I, love our daughter, and we will do , all we can to make her happy, 
We will try, to do, what we think is best, for our daughter. and we don/t mind, she has to wear glasses.
