I appreciate that endings to stories are not always as easy as the beginnings.  I have one which is possibly 80% written.  I know what the outcome will be, but how to get there reasonably quickly without just putting a full stop, or rambling on for several thousand words is another matter.  It makes me all the more appreciative of the efforts of others.
