Kelley and Corey are 17 year old twins , they will be going into their last year of high school.
 Kelley is a beautiful blonde, well developed sturdy athletic girl , who loves sports.
Corey is a well build , very handsome boy , who plays baseball, football and in the winter ice hockey.
They are good students, popular and well liked at their school, a lot of boys like to date Kelley, she has a date once and a while , but boys don t get her to excited.
Corey is to busy with sports and school work to worry about girls.
Both Corey and Kelley wear glasses for myopia, because their prescription is not very strong they only wear them at school , or going to the movies and when watching T.V.
The school year is almost finished and they are looking forward to an exciting summer of playing sports , camping and swimming.

The holidays had just nicely started , when their dad came home from work  with the news that he had received a promotion and they would be moving to a small city about 400 Km away.
On Saturday the family would drive there to see about houses that would be available and also to familiarize  themselves with the new surroundings.
Both Kelley and Corey are not very happy about moving, leaving their friends  and familiar surroundings , but since they have no choice decided to be positive , they should not have any trouble getting new friends.

The trip was very enjoyable , the scenery beautiful , and the weather was great
Both Kelley and Corey wore their glasses to day so they would not miss anything.
Their dad had arranged ea meeting with a real estate agent, who would show them available houses in different neighborhoods 
They were all impressed how nice and clean everything looked , and the choice of houses available.
They spend a lot of time looking at houses, then they saw a very attractive house and after inspecting it , they all agreed that of all the hoses they had looked at, liked this on best., it also was located close to the high school  and recreation center , which had an arena , swimming pool and sports fields.
Since they all liked the house their dad put in an offer to purchase.
The following week they were informed that their bid on the house had been accepted, and they all felt better about having to move.
Both Kelley and Corey were due for their annual eye exam , and their parents thought they better get it done before the move.
They were not surprised , when they were told they both had an increase in their prescription, and now should wear their glasses full time.
They had expected it , so they selected new frames frames that they liked and would not mind wearing full time.

When the move was completed , it did not take them long to get settled.
The next day Kelley and Corey went for a walk  to look around and to visit the recreation  center  and pool , and to check on schedules and prices.
On the way home they walked past the sports fields  where some fellows were throwing a football, one of them threw the ball at Corey , he moved fast  and caught the ball
Great catch , you want to play ?
Sure would like to, Kelley said go and play with them and meet some of the guys , I will walk home.
After throwing the ball for a while  they asked him, are you new here, we have not seen you before.
Yes we just moved here , my name is Corey.
Glad to meet you I am Bradley, said a good looking well build guy, we can use you on our high school team , we have a practice here tomorrow , you are invited.
Great you can count on me I will be here.
At the practice the next day everybody including the coach was impressed with Corey s play and he was invited to join the team.
After the practice Bradley, who had taken a liking to Corey invited him to his place for a drink.
While they were talking , a very pleasant, good looking girl with long curly hair done up in a pony tail joined them.
Corey I like you to meet my twin sister Ashley
I am glad to meet you Ashley, so you are twins, what a coincidence , believe it or not , I have a twin sister., she was with me yesterday , and I am sure she would like to meet you
They decide to meet at the food court at the mall.
Kelley was glad to go and when she and Corey arrived at the foo court , Ashley and Bradley were waiting for them., introductions were made, and they all knew right away they would be friends.
They had a great time getting to know each other, and when they left to go home , Kelley invited Ashley to come and see her the next day.
When Ashley came , Kelley was all excited , she liked that girl, she was beautiful, alive and full of fun.
She invited Ashley up to her bed room ,where they sat down and talked and talked and learning more about each other their likes and dislikes., and realized they had a lot in common.
Kelley how long have you been wearing glasses, you look so nice wearing them, and I just love the looks of people wearing glases.
This is my second pair , and I just started to wear them all day, because the prescription increased, my first pair I only wore them at school and going to the movies.
What is it like to wear glasses? 
Wearing glasses is great because they make you see properly , I also like wearing them because they make me feel confident, and I like the looks of them.
I just love the looks of glasses , and if you don t mind would like to try them sometime.
Here give my glasses a try, then you can find out what glasses are like.
Ashley put the glasses on. Oh they are pretty strong , everything is a little fuzzy, but they feel very comfortable, what do I look like?
Why don t you look in the mirror, I think you look great glasses really suit you.
Oh my goodness of what I can see , they look kind of nice.
I have my old glasses here, you can try them, and you might be able to see better with them
Yes I would like to try them. When she put the glasses on said yes , I like them , they look good , they feel kind of exciting, and I can see everything nice and clear wearing these  glasses they are great.
