Specs4ever asked a while back about should he continue writing stories. Of course he should and all those who do likewise. I read many of them, not all, and as is obvious I really like and enjoy those which touch on my own fantasies.  The stories written are principally written by the author to satisfy their own fantasy, this is very natural. 
 Another story telling technique which I enjoy is the interactive story, made possible by online communications.  My father told us children stories which he now admits had no predetermined end. As he told them he picked up our reactions and wove that into what he was telling. Like wise there are a couple of guys I have met here who use the internet to tell their fantasy but allow me to interject my own. We have to remember these are as the title states "fantasy" stories.
Story telling is an ancient art. It allows us to escape into our fantasy world. A world full of spex, strong minus lenses, strong plus lenses, cut in, lens thickness and the list goes on. GOC is another story telling, not written down but allowing us to live our life as we want to be and without words telling others how we feel.
