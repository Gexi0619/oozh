Back in the days when I was a cocky young kid of 17 I used to hang around the record store at the local mall with some of my buddies.  One Saturday morning as I was walking towards the record store I saw a girl who I was fairly sure went to my high school, although she was in grade 10 while I was in 11.  I didn’t know her by name or anything about her but had seen her around school just often enough to know she looked familiar. When I looked at her with her mom I found that my heart was racing and I was immediately infatuated. But my infatuation was not with the young lady.  My attention was focused on the mother.  Even though I could tell that her mother looked quite young I realized that there would never be any chance for me to get to first base with her. But the mother was exactly the lady I was searching for in my life.

You might ask just what it was about the mother that made her so desirable to me. She was very attractive, with long blond hair hanging down over her shoulders.  Her cleavage was quite substantial, although not excessive.  Like her daughter she was reasonably tall and quite slim and trim, and she fit into her jeans like she was poured into them.  But none of that mattered to me. What intrigued and infatuated me was the pair of glasses she wore on her face.  I don’t know what is wrong with me, but ever since I was a small boy women with glasses have attracted me like bees to a flower.  I have never, and will never reveal this to anyone, but I can not deny that the glasses that this lady wore were about the most perfect pair of glasses I had ever seen.  I knew that she was extremely nearsighted because of the way things looked much smaller when viewed through the lenses of her glasses.  And I could tell from the fact that part of her prescription was ground into the front of her lenses, along with the amount of lens that was showing behind the frame of her glasses that this was a pretty substantial prescription.  Possibly, to someone who didn’t like strong minus glasses, the glasses she wore could be viewed as being disfiguring on the pretty face of such an attractive lady, but to me they enhanced her beauty beyond belief.

I walked over to them and said to the daughter, “Hi, I have noticed you around school recently. My name is Brandon, Brandon Wilson.”

“Hi Brandon.  I am Lisa Archer and I am pretty sure you are a grade ahead of me.” Lisa answered.  

“That is what I though. I figured that you either transferred from another school into grade 11 or just came from junior high to high school this year.  How do you like it?” I asked.

“I like it.  Everyone is really nice.” Lisa replied.

I enjoyed talking to Lisa, but I enjoyed being able to get a longer and closer look at her mom better.  I finally said goodbye and wandered over to the record store to hang with my friends.  But hanging with my friends just didn’t do it for me that morning and soon I made up an excuse that I had to help my dad with something and I went on home. All afternoon I kept thinking about Mrs. Archer. The more I thought about her, the hornier I got, and I had to help myself jack off a couple of times. This relieved the tension, but of course it didn’t really help the long term problem.

When I got to school on Monday the first thing I did was to look for Lisa Archer so I could see where her locker was.  She was there, and I could not avoid being seen by her so I casually waved at her and proceeded on my way.  Later on, as we went to lunch I saw her heading into the cafeteria, and I went up to her and asked her if she wanted to sit with me.  I suppose she was pleased to see a guy taking an interest in her, and she accepted. We talked mostly about our families that day, and when I left her I told her I would see her again.

Lisa’s mom had captivated me, but after looking carefully at Lisa I could tell that she was pretty much a younger version of her mom.  I knew I should have looked carefully into her eyes to see if I could spot the telltale signs of contact lenses on her eyeballs, because if Lisa was anywhere close to being as nearsighted as her mom she would indeed be the perfect girl for me.  It took me a couple more lunches with Lisa before I knew for sure that her mom’s myopia had been passed on to her daughter and once I spotted the contacts she was wearing I started to look for other telltale signs.  And, every once in a while there were some.  When she looked at things in the distance Lisa would often scrunch up her eyes slightly.  This was something that a casual observer likely would not notice, but since I was searching for these signs I could tell.  As well, one day she was sitting in the cafeteria waiting for me to come in and I spotted her reading one of her textbooks. She was holding the textbook pretty darned close to her face, and that only confirmed that she was fairly nearsighted.

I gradually worked my way into being a fairly constant visitor at the Archer’s house. Her dad was a heavy equipment operator for one of the local road building companies and he must have made enough money that Lisa’s mom didn’t have to work, because she was home for Lisa and her brother Randy when they got back from school every day. Even though her glasses were pretty strong Mrs. Archer had good enough eyesight with her strong glasses to be able to drive because I saw her drop Lisa off at school on a couple of rainy mornings.  Randy was 3 years younger than Lisa, and he did wear glasses a lot of the time, but his glasses didn’t look to be really strong enough for full time wear.

I was having a hard time being able to go out on a date with Lisa.  Her parents had set a 10pm curfew for the kids, and they were not yet prepared to let Lisa break it.  I could almost understand their reluctance because I had found out that Mrs. Archer was only 17 and barely married when she had Lisa. Now she was still only 33, and I suppose that since she was so young it was one of the reasons she looked so hot to me. I was fairly content just to hang around with Lisa at their house though, because that put me within viewing distance of her mom and I certainly made the most of my chances.

In early November our school had a Sadie Hawkins Dance.  I was a little surprised when Lisa asked me if I wanted to take her to it.  I asked her about her curfew, and she told me her dad would allow her to stay out until 11 pm, but not a minute after.  We had a great time at the dance and I made sure she was home by 10:55 because I didn’t want to ruin any future chances.

That sort of broke the ice.  While Lisa’s curfew remained at 10pm, if we were going to be a little late all she had to do was call her dad and explain.  We made sure that this didn’t happen very often though.  Most of the time we went to the 7pm movie and it always ended in time for me to get Lisa back home. At least we were dating, and that was a plus in my books.  If I couldn’t have her mom as my girlfriend being with Lisa was the next best thing.

Lisa’s dad must have liked me, because the next summer he got me a job at the construction company where he worked.  I was only running a small loader at the asphalt plant but at least it was a start. He and I rode to work together most days because he left his car there and we rode out to the job site with the crew.  When Mrs. Archer wanted the car she would drive both of us to work, and would then come back to pick us up.  Every time she drove I couldn’t help but wonder just what she actually saw through her thick glasses.  She always was able to see the other traffic, and she never missed a red light, but I still would have loved to be looking through those lenses with her eyes.

One morning when she drove us to work I overheard her talking to her husband about the eye exams that she and Lisa and Randy were having that day.  I would have loved to say something, but I figured it was best that I keep my mouth shut.  The following day when we were driving to work I asked Mr. Archer how the eye exams had gone for his wife and kids.  He didn’t hesitate and told me that all 3 of them needed stronger prescriptions.  I expressed surprise at hearing that Lisa needed glasses, and that is when Dale Archer told me that Lisa had worn glasses ever since she was 5 years old, but had changed to contact lenses when she was 14.

“But Lisa’s eyes aren’t very bad are they?” I asked.

“Her eyes are a little worse than her mothers were at her age.” Dale told me.

“I didn’t even know Lisa wore glasses.” I said.

“Well, in that case, don’t tell anyone I told you. Lisa is pretty self conscious about her glasses, even though they are not nearly as strong as Mary’s are yet.” Dale said.

The following day was Saturday and I often came over to Lisa’s house after lunch. That day, as we were sitting together watching television I asked her how her eye exam had gone – knowing full well that she had needed stronger contacts.

“I needed an increase in my contact lens prescription.” Lisa said.

“Did you get new glasses as well?” I asked.

“I got a new pair of clear glasses and then my mom got my old glasses changed to my new prescription with sunglass lenses.” Lisa said.

“Are you ever going to let me see you wearing glasses?’ I asked.

“No.” Lisa answered.

“Why not?” I asked.

“My glasses look ugly. They are really strong.” Lisa said.

‘I don’t think your mom’s glasses look ugly on her. Yours can’t be that strong.” I replied.

“No, they aren’t. But they still look really thick.” Lisa said.

“Don’t you ever wear glasses?  It isn’t good for your eyes to wear contact lenses all the time.” I said.

‘I wear glasses sometimes around the house. Why do you think I asked you to always call before you come over?” Lisa answered.

“Probably so you can put your contacts in and I don’t get to see you wearing glasses.” I replied.

By the end of the summer Lisa had her new contacts, and likely had her new sunglasses and clear glasses as well, but I still hadn’t gotten to see her wearing glasses. Randy had gotten new glasses that were slightly stronger than his old ones, and now he wore them most of the time. Mary Archer had gotten new glasses that I thought looked just fantastic on her face. She had apparently tried a new type of lens that was called superlenti.  Prior to this new technology once the old style plastic CR39 lens reached its maximum thickness a person had to go to a lens called a myodisc to get their proper correction.  But the new technology didn’t look nearly as obvious as the fried egg look of the old type myodiscs did because the myodisc circle was blended into the area around the myodisc circle.  Mary Archer had gotten one of the first pairs of superlenti lenses that had been sold by her optician, and she had adjusted to wearing them quite well. She loved the fact that her lenses no longer looked as thick as they previously had appeared.

I thought that with her new glasses on Mary Archer looked gorgeous.  I told Lisa that, and I think that Lisa was a little upset that I thought that her mom was beautiful.  But to save myself I also told Lisa that since she looked just like her mom she was just as beautiful to me.

During the following year I graduated from grade 12, and my marks were good enough that I could have gone on to college.  But I didn’t know what I wanted to do.  I really liked running the loader at the asphalt plant and I went back to speak to the man I had worked under the previous summer.  He and I had gotten along really well and it did not surprise me when he hired me as a full time employee.  I also got to drive a much larger loader because I was now filling the batch plant hoppers. I still rode to work every day with Dale, and again on days that Mary needed the car she drove us both to work.  This summer Mary was using the car more frequently because Lisa had gotten her beginners permit, and she was driving her mom around.  But she would never get out of bed early enough to put her contact lenses in to drive her dad and I to work with her mom as a passenger.

The following year, with Lisa in her final year of high school, we started to discuss the possibilities of a future together.  I liked Lisa a lot, and I know she liked me.  She wanted to graduate, and then take 2 years of nurses training before we got married. I wanted to get married as soon as she finished school and then she could take all the nurses training she wanted to take.  This did not create a problem for us though and eventually I decided I would let Lisa do what she wanted to do.

I think Lisa was smarter than I was.  She had realized that having both of us live at home while she finished school would give us a better chance to save money  My parents did charge me for my room and board, but I was working long hours and I ended up being able to save a fairly good sum of money during that 3 year period.  We had planned our wedding to happen in late July after Lisa had graduated as a beginner nurse, and after Lisa graduated in June the rest of that month was spent in wedding preparations.  I did take an afternoon off to accompany Lisa to her eye exam as she felt she needed a slight increase in her prescription.  Her mom and Randy had also gotten new glasses a year earlier but neither of them thought they needed another eye exam yet but Lisa was sure she needed another increase and she felt she might as well have it covered by her dad’s health plan because mine didn’t have vision care on it yet.

Finally I was able to find out what Lisa’s prescription was. Her doctor insisted that she wear her glasses the day of her eye exam, and although she changed her clear glasses for her sunglasses when she went outside that was the first time I had seen her wearing any glasses in the 4 years we had been going together.  Lisa’s glasses were not nearly as thick and strong as her moms were, but they did appear to have a fairly substantial prescription.  After her eyes were examined she came back out with the slip her doctor had written for her and we then went over to the optical store where she always got her new glasses and contacts.

While Lisa and the optician were choosing a frame I managed to get a good look at Lisa’s prescription slip. Her right eye was now -14.50D and her left eye was -14.25 x -0.50 x 90. Her new contacts were going to have to be -12.50D. She had already told me that she had indeed required a slight increase, but I didn’t know just what that meant. Finally they had chosen 3 frames that the optician felt looked nice on Lisa.  She modeled them all for me, and I liked a pair that was a fairly small eye sized rectangular shaped plastic frame. Lisa liked that on as well, so we ordered her new lenses for that frame.  The existing frame that Lisa had her clear lenses in was a plastic frame with a much larger eye size, and Lisa wanted her new sunglass lenses placed in that frame.

“Why are you bothering to order sunglasses?” I asked.

“I always have had a pair of prescription sunnies.  I know, I don’t wear them very often, but I really need them if I have to wear glasses on a sunny day.  Anyway, it isn’t very expensive to have new sunglass lenses put in my old frames.” Lisa replied.

Lisa ended up ordering exactly what she intended to order and since her dad’s policy was paying for it I really didn’t care. I just hoped that once we were married I would get to see her wearing her glasses a lot because seeing her that day wearing glasses had aroused me a lot.

Finally the wedding day was over and after Lisa and I slipped away from the reception we drove for another hour to the motel I had reserved for our honeymoon night. We were so tired we just ended up falling asleep in each other’s arms that night.  But we more than made up for our lack of sexual involvement the following morning. When the 11 am checkout time rolled around we were all showered and ready to go.  Lisa searched her purse just before we left the room and she exclaimed “Oh darn!” 

“What’s wrong honey?” I asked.

“Do you think my regular sunglasses are in the car Brandon?” Lisa asked.

“I can pretty much guarantee you that they aren’t. If they are not in your purse you might have left them in the limo.” I replied.

“It is so bright out I can’t go without sunglasses today. My eyes will get sore and I will have a massive headache.” Lisa said.

“Do you want to see if we can find a place where we can buy you a cheap pair?” I asked.

“Cheap ones give me bad headaches.  Would you mind if I took my contacts out and wore my prescription sunglasses for today?” Lisa asked.

“Personally I wouldn’t care if you never wore contact lenses again. You look just as nice wearing glasses as you do when you aren’t wearing them.” I answered.

For the next 14 days Lisa wore her sunglasses when we were outside during the day and her clear glasses all the rest of the time.  By the time our honeymoon was over and we were driving back home I had gotten so used to seeing Lisa wearing glasses that I was beginning to hate the thought that she would likely go back to contact lens wear as soon as we got back to the house we had rented.  It surprised me the first morning we were home when Lisa showered, did her hair and got ready for work without putting in her contacts.  I had to leave first, but as I went out the door she still had her glasses on, and I commented her on how nice she looked.

“You really don’t mind me wearing glasses do you Brandon.” Lisa stated.

“I love you either way, but as I said before I wouldn’t care if you never wore contacts again.” I replied.

That didn’t happen.  But Lisa did change her contact lens wear schedule a lot.  Now she wore contacts for special occasions and she often wore her glasses to work.  It seemed that she would wear contacts 2 or 3 days a week, and the other days would be glasses days.  It had taken her the 2 weeks of our honeymoon to get used to wearing glasses again and I was very thankful that her expensive nonprescription sunglasses had been misplaced for our honeymoon.  The limo company had saved them for her, and I really couldn’t thank them enough for the wedding present they had given me.

Now when I look at my wife on her glasses days she looks just like her mother did the day I first spotted them at the mall.
