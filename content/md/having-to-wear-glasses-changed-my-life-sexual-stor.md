Nothing is going right these days
My dad came home last night and told us, that he had a promotion and we are moving.
That is not all, to day I had an eye exam, and was told I need to wear glasses
Me wearing glasses, I can t believe it, they told me I am myopic, I don t believe it.

When I came home, did not get much sympathy from my family. 
My dad told me, wearing glasses is no problem, you soon will appreciate wearing glasses, they sure help you to see properly.
He told me I have worn glasses since I was your age and would not want to be without them.
My older brother who wears glasses, welcomed me to the glasses club, and told me, it won t take long and you will be a happy glasses wearer.
My mother felt sorry for me, suggested she go with me, to help select a nice frame.
The next day mom and I went shopping for glasses,
It took us a while to find the right frame, I must say she was a big help.
When the glasses were ready and I put them on realized right away, why I was prescribed glasses.
Looking around noticed things I have not seen for a while, everything looks so nice and clear wherever I look.
When I looked at myself in a mirror, was pleasantly surprised, I think I look studious and more grown up.
At supper that night, received a lot of compliments, I feel a little better now having to wear glasses.

We have now moved into our new house, in as far as I am concerned a strange city.
I[Megan] still don t feel very good about the move.
I left behind all my girl friends, and familiar surroundings, I feel like a fish out of water.
I do like our new house, and my nice spacious bedroom
I am now busy getting everything in place in my new room.
I love the nice love seat, so great to curl up on, and fantasize. 

A few days later our doorbell rang.
When I opened the door,  smiled when I saw a pretty girl, standing there.
Hi, I am Ashley, I live a couple of doors down the street, when I saw you I guessed you were about my age, and wanted to meet you and say hello..
I am Megan, I am glad to meet you Ashley.
Ashley is a very personable, pretty girl with a beautiful head of curly hair.
We soon became friends and realized we had a lot in common, and also will be in the same grade in high school. 
The next day, Ashley showed me around town, the high school, parks and arena, but most important where to go if you enjoy shopping.
When we stopped for some refreshments, I asked if she had a boy friend.
She told me no, my experience with boys is nothing to write home about.
I really enjoyed the trip with Ashley, I am so lucky to have found a friend. 

A few days later Ashley and I took the bus to the mall.
We had a great time looking around.
When we walked past the optical store, I asked Ashley if she minded if I went in, I needed to get my glasses adjusted.
Ashley said sure, I have never been in an optical store. 
When we entered the store and Ashley looked around, told me she could not believe the large selection of glasses available.
After I had my glasses adjusted, and we looked around, Ashley told me she wanted to try some frames.
She would like to find out how she would look wearing glasses.
She tried some different frames and told me how surprised she was, that she could look so attractive wearing glasses.
I told her she looked fantastic wearing glasses,  and you have the perfect type of face for wearing glasses.
On the way home on the bus, Ashley asked me, what is it like having to wear glasses.
I told her that the improvement in your vision is unbelievable, the frames are very light and comfortable, and most of the time you forget you are wearing glasses.
Ashley told me that she had never looked through prescription lenses, what is that like?
So I handed her my glasses, here try them.
Ashley put them on and looked around, everything looks a little fuzzy, but I love the feel of the glasses on my face, how do I look?
You look very nice wearing glasses.
After she handed me my glasses back said, I would like to try them again some other time, I just love the exciting feeling I get, when wearing the glasses.

A few days later Ashley and I got together to do some home work.
We were in Ashley s bedroom where her computer and desk are.
The topic of the lesson we were working on was about sex and same sex relations.
Suddenly Ashley asked me if she could wear my glasses again.
I handed her my glasses and after Ashley put them on, smiled and said I just love the sexy feeling I get when wearing glasses,.
Excuse me, and she left the room wearing my glasses.
When she came back into the room about five minutes later said,  thank you Megan for the loan of your glasses, I am sure now, that I want to wear glasses, I just love the feel of them. 
Ashley asked me if I had any suggestions, besides going for an eye exam.
I told her I would have to think about it.

When I was talking to my brother, I asked him if he still had any of his old glasses, that I needed a pair to use as a prop in the drama class.
He told me he has three pair, I will give you the two oldest ones, I need my latest pair for when Brandon comes to see me, he likes wearing those glasses.
After going through his desk drawers, came back and handed me the glasses.
I thanked him and went to my room and looked at the glasses Logan had given me.
One pair which must have been the first pair he had, were not as strong as my present prescription.
I looked at the frame, a nice brown plastic unisex type frame.
The other pair were a little stronger than then my present prescription, and to my surprise I could see well when wearing them, and realized I most likely was due for an increase in my prescription. 
I was so glad to have the glasses Logan had given me, now I knew what I was going to do.

On Saturday night my parents had gone out, and Ashley came to visit me, my brother had his friend Brandon over.
I asked Ashley do you still want to wear glasses?
Megan you know, I want to wear glasses, why are you teasing me?
I handed her a glasses case, this is for you.
When Ashley opened the case and saw the glasses, smiled and put the glasses on right away.
She looked around and said, Megan these glasses are fantastic, I can t believe how well I can see wearing them.
She walked over to the mirror and looked at herself, I love the way I look wearing the glasses.
Megan I don t know how to thank you, then Ashley came over to me put her arm around my neck and kissed me on the mouth.
This was the first time a girl ever kissed me, and surprisingly I kind of liked it.
Ashley said these glasses make me feel so sexy and went to the bathroom.
When she came back, told me that the guys were pretty loud, and had heard them saying, let s do a sixty nine.
Do you know what that is?
I told her I did not know what it meant, all I know is that Logan has told me that Brandon likes to wear his old glasses.
Well it sounded as if they are having a real good time.

Ashley was so happy having glasses to wear, that she wore them all night.
She kept on telling me how well she could see, and how she loved wearing the glasses.
When I sat down on the love seat I have, Ashley did not waste any time to sit beside me.
All she talked about was the glasses and how she loved wearing them.
When I told Ashley she could take the glasses home with her, smiled and told me I deserved another big kiss and hug which we both enjoyed.

The next day, I asked my brother what it meant doing a sixty nine.
Where did you get that?
Well when Ashley went to the bathroom she heard one of you say well let us do a sixty nine. 
Oh, that is just guys talk, Brandon likes to wear my old glasses, he just loves the feel of them on his face, he might have said something that Ashley heard, nothing special.

Since we were studying about sexuality, I started searching on my computer.
I now start to understand why I never cared to much about boys, and why I always felt more comfortable with girls, and now start to realize I might be a lesbian.
I like Ashley very much, I am almost sure that I love her.

Last night I had a wonderful dream,  I went with Ashley to get her new prescription glasses.
When we came home had so much fun trying each others glasses, and how we got carried away and started to kiss each other, and cuddling up 
I was so sexually aroused when I woke up, that after satisfying myself, wondered what now?

The next day when working on the computer found the information about a sixty nine.
Was my brother gay?
 I am pretty sure I am a lesbian?

A couple of weeks later Ashley told me, that her mother had noticed her squinting often, and had made an appointment for an eye exam,
When the day for her exam came, I went with her.
She was so happy when she came out of the examination room, and told me she was prescribed glasses.
After trying some frames and finding one that she just loved,  told me she wanted to order the glasses on line.  
When I order them on line, I can add an extra diopter and increase my myopia, and become very myopic, I love love the look of stronger lens
We had a ball ordering the glasses on line. 
Ashley ordered three frames that all looked exactly the same, but each one, one diopter stronger.
She told me she had read up on inducing myopia and that was supposed the way to do it.

Ashley told her parents she was prescribed glasses, and her glasses would be send in the mail.
As soon as I get them I will show you how I look wearing glasses,
When we came home from school about a week later, Ashley s mother handed her a parcel that had come in the mail.
We went upstairs to Ashley s bedroom to unpack the glasses.
We both tried the three pair she had ordered, and I found trying all the different prescriptions very arousing.
Ashley you look fantastic wearing the glasses, you look good enough to kiss.
Well, what are you waiting for?
So I walked over to her and we had some very satisfying hugs and kisses.
Ashley wearing her new glasses, went downstairs to show her mother how she looked wearing glasses.
Her mother told her how nice she looked, but felt so sorry for her, that she had to wear glasses.
Ashley told her I don t mind, I can see so much better now.
So Ashley is now wearing her glasses full time, and not long after started to wear the stronger prescription glasses she had ordered.

Ashley was asked for a date to day by a guy, who according to all the girls at school, is the best catch there is.
She told me she did not like boys very much, and had told him no thanks.
I am sure Ashley is like me, and that we both are lesbians.

My dad had a short business trip and my mother went with him.
When Ashley came over to see me, she was wearing her strongest pair of glasses.
Sitting on our love seat, we had a few hugs and kisses, while we exchanged glasses .
Both of us were now sexually aroused, I gave Ashley a kiss and said, let s go to bed.
It did not take us long to get undressed and hitting the pillows.
We enjoyed our first sleeping together experience, and after wards showered and washed each other.
Now we knew, we were a couple. 

Time goes fast, we have graduated high school and both Ashley and I will be going to college in the fall.
After my last eye exam I had an increase in my prescription, and it now reads -2.75 for the right and – 3,00 for the left eye and a little bit of astigmatism.
Ashley was happy when her prescription went up, she is now -3,25 on the right and -3.00 on the left eye, she just loves the looks of her new lenses.
We both enjoy sitting on my love seat exchanging our glasses,
Ashley and I always get aroused, but we don t have to go to the bathroom anymore, we both know what to do about it.

To day my brother came home wearing new, stronger looking glasses.
I complimented him on his new look, and asked him if he still did sixty nines with Brandon.
Yes I do, and even some other things, I guess you now know by now that I am gay, please let s keep it a secret.
I told him I understand, you can trust me.

Ashley and I are room mates while we are going to college, and are planning to live together in an apartment after graduating, we love each other, and we sure love wearing glasses.

Both of us graduated and are now licensed opticians, and are working at a large optical store.
We both love our job, and now are living in a nice apartment,
Our parents know what we are and have accepted it.
We both love wearing our glasses and our prescriptions are now in the – 4 to -5 range.
At our last vision exam were told, that there was no increase in our prescriptions.
The optometrist told us she expects no more big changes. 
We don t mind, we now like the way our lenses look.  
Now we  can start to build a wardrobe of glasses, so we can wear different glasses to go with the outfits we wear that day.
There we are, a pair of glasses wearing Lesbians, who love each other, love their job, and of course most of all love wearing glasses, how lucky can you get.
When I think back to the day that I was told I had to wear glasses, and how I hated the thought of wearing glasses.
Having to wear glasses changed my life.
How lucky can you get!!!!
