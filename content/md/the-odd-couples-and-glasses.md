Trevor a 12 year old  is a very athletic boy , who loves riding his bike, playing soccer and baseball.
His close friend Jeff who lived next door has moved away, and he sure misses him.
New people are due to move in Jeff s house next weekend .
Trevor hopes there will be a boy his age , so he can have a friend next door.

The weekend came , and the new people moved in next door.
Trevor was not very happy  when he noticed a girl about his age , and a younger boy.
Trevor was really surprised when he was ready to go on his bike , holding his baseball glove , when the new girl from next door approached him, and asked if she could go with him.
He did not know what to say,
Just a minute and I will be ready.
There she came with her bike and a baseball glove and said let s go.
On the way to the playground  she said my name is Kate, what is yours ?
When they arrived at the ball park , Trevor soon realized that Kate knew how to play ball , she could catch , throw the ball better than a lot of guys.
Soon Trevor was looking forward to play ball with her , and so became close friends.

About a year later , when Trevor came over to see Kate, he could not believe his eyes.
Kate was wearing glasses.
What happened ?
We always have a yearly eye exam, because myopia runs in the family.
I now have to wear glasses I am myopic.
Well you look very nice wearing glasses, I like the look of your eyes behind the lenses.
Do you like wearing the ?
I don t mind , I can see so much better now, and I am getting used to wearing them. 
Trevor asked many questions about glasses , and of course had to try them on.
He soon realized glasses were exciting and fascinating.
He noticed that Kate when wearing glasses did everything as good if not better .
Wearing glasses sure did not slow her down.

When Trevor  and Kate were in high school , Kate had another increase in her glasses prescription.
Her glasses now showed some nice rings,
Trevor sure liked the looks of glasses , and would not mind if he had to wear glasses.

When Trevor applied for his drivers license , he failed the vision test.
He was prescribed glasses, and when he got his glasses  was surprised how much better he coul now see.
He liked how good he looked wearing glasses.
He received many compliments  when he wore his glasses to school
A few days later Kate told Trevor that Ashley had told her how sh loved his new looks , and would not mind going out  with him.
Trevor had noticed Ashley before, she is a very pretty , has beautiful hair , and is very popular,
He never expected that she might be interested in him.

The next day after school.Trevor approached Ashley and asked her if she would like to go out with him?  
Ashley told him she would like to , and they agreed to meet at the mall food court  Saturday afternoon.

Trevor was all excited waiting for Ashley , and when he saw her  got up and greeted her with a great big smile.
They sat down, and Trevor asked her what she would like?
Ashley looked at the menu board , and finally said I would like a chocolate milk shake.
Trevor went to the counter placed the order, and then took their drinks to their table.
They talked about school, and their friends  and then Ashley told Trevor how she liked the look of him wearing glasses
What is it like to wear glasses?
Trevor told her he liked wearing glasses, they had improved his vision , and are comfortable to wear.
Ashley the told him she loves the looks of glasses on men and women.
Kate looks fantastic wearing glasses.
I think I have a thing for glasses.
May I try your glasses?
Trevor handed her his glasses, she put them on , smiled and said I sure like the feel of glasses on my face.
She looked around and told him everything looks fuzzy.
Do you think I need glasses ?
You need an eye exam to answer that question.
How do I look wearing glasses ?
I think you will look terrific wearing glasses if you select a proper frame.
Ashley gave Trevor his glasses back.
I think I would like to wear glasses , let s go to the optical store and try some of the frames to see what I look like wearing glasses.

In the optical store Ashley was so excited, she loved the looks of herself wearing the glasses frames.
Trevor could not believe how nice Ashley looked wearing some of the frames.
He now was hoping Ashley would need to wear glasses.boy she looked good.
On the way home Ashley told Trevor she would have to check with her parents about making an appointment for an eye exam.
I hope I need to wear glasses.

At school Trevor was noticing that Kat was spending a lot of time with Megan, a good looking glasses wearing girl.
He asked Kate about her new friend .
Kate told him  I like girls best , I am a lesbian , nobody knows. 
but you are my closest friend  and trust you with my secret
Trevor said you can count on me , that is what friends are for.

The next time Ashley and Trevor had a date they went to see a movie.
When they were seated and waiting for the movie to start , Trevor asked Ashley if she had her eye exam yet.
She told him her dad had to check his insurance coverage at work first , before she could make an appointment.

When the show started , Ashley told Trevor she would like to try his glasses again.
When Ashley was wearing the glasses  she was not happy.
When wearing the glasses everything looked fuzzy, she would have liked to see everything nice and clear.
When the movie was finished , Ashley told Trevor how disapointed she was not being able to see better wearing his glasses.
All I have is a headache , perhaps I don t need glasses.

When Ashley came home from school, her mother told her that she had booked an eye appointment for her. Monday after school.
Ashley was not very excited about going for an eye exam , she had not been able to see wearing Trevor s   glasses , and now was sure she did not need to wear glasses.

Ashley and her mother went to the optical store.
Ashley was very nervous when she went into the examination room
The doctor was very pleasant and very thorough.
Ashley had no trouble reading the wall chart , but had trouble reading the fine print.
When the exam was finished the doctor told her she was farsighted  and had some astigmatism , and should wear glasses.
Ashley was surprised and happy , she would be wearing glasses.
Her mother helped her select a frame that Ashley liked very much.
When her glasses were ready , and she put them on and looked at herself in the mirror
Loved her new look , her eyes looked a little bigger and so nice , she loved it.

Kate asked Trevor how he would feel about double dating.
Trevor told her it was a great idea.
The next weekend the four of them went to see a movie
After the movie went to the food court for some refreshments,
While the were enjoying the conversation , a couple of friends from school came over and sat with them.
Sandy , a pleasant girl ,and Kelley, a glasses wearing red haired girl.
It did not take Trevor long  to figure out they were more than friends.
The food court at the mall was a great meeting place .
A few minutes late Jeff and Bob joined the group
 Trevor knew they were gay.
At on point the conversation , they talked about forming a club  for lesbians and gays at school.
Trevor thought it was a good idea , they all agreed.
Since all of them were in their last year of high school, the club might help some of the younger students 
with the orientation of sex preferences
They decided to approach the school principal.  

When they approached the school principal, he agreed, .
With all the changes in the laws , and a greater acceptance of other peoples sex preferences, they were allowed to form a club.
They decided that the first important item was to create an understanding and acceptance of a persons sex  choice.
and to see guidance from the L.B.G.T.organization.
The club was a succes , they were very pleased that there were so few negative reactions.
The meetings were well attended.
With the proper guidance  a lot of them now came out of the closet , aand that made life much easier.

After graduation the couples enjoyed going out as a group 
Now that they were older started to enjoy the bar scene.

A few years later Trevor and Ashley were going to get married,
Kate and Megan were to  be the brides maids and Kate s younger brother the best man.
The close friendship remained , and when because of the new laws , Kate and Megan were going to be married 
Trevor was the best man for Kate and Ashley the bridesmaid for Megan.
When they were happily married Kate  thanked Trevor for being such a good friend.
Kate had another surprise  , Megan now started to wear glasses , she was hyperopic and looked fantastic wearing the stronger plus lenses.

Trevor and Ashley had a baby girl and named it Kate, and also asked Kate and Megan to be the god parents.
They were thrilled to be asked and accepted the responsibility
 Baby Kate was very spoiled with so many doting on her.

It all comes to show to be open minded , and that it does not matter what your sex preference is,
that way everybody will get along just fie,
