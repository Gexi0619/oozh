My name is Ashley, I am 7 years old, and in grade 2.
I love the looks of eyeglasses very much.
My mother wears glasses , she looks so nice , her lenses seem to sparkle .
Her eyes look  so nice , I thinks she looks beautiful wearing glasses .
I would like to have to wear glasses , just like my mother , and look just as beautiful.

There are  two students in my class wearing glasses, but their lenses look so different than my mother s.
The lenses seem to magnify , and make their eyes look larger.
I asked my mother about the magnifying lenses.
She told me there are different type of lenses . depending what your vision problem is.
Some people have trouble seeing things far away, like I do , they are myopic and wear lenses that minify 
Other people have trouble seeing things that are close , like reading , and wear the glasses that magnify.

I hope that when I have to wear glasses , I will have the same type of lenses as in my mothers glasses.

I had an eye exam last year , the optometrist told me I have nice healthy eyes and don t need to wear glasses.
He would like to have another look at my eyes in about a year.
All he did was shine a light in my eyes , and had me read the letters below the big E.
I am looking forward to my next eye exam , and hope he will tell me then that I need to wear glasses.
I love eyeglasses.

Another girl in my class cam to school to day wearing glasses
She told me she had trouble to read what was on the blackboard , and now wearing glasses , she can see everything far away nice and clear.
She let me try her glasses , I noticed everything looking a little brighter , I loved the feel of the glasses on my face, and hated to give them back/
I was so jealous that she has glasses now , and with the type of lens I like.

At school I have noticed that more of the older students in grade 5 and 6 are now wearing glasses 
A lot of them wear the same type of lenses as in my mothers glasses, that she told me were for myopia 
I think that boys and girls who wear glasses look so much nicer, and more mature.
Perhaps when I am a little older , I will be glasses like that, I can t wait

We went to see grandma .
I could not believe my eyes when I saw her.
She was wearing glasses with very strong lenses which made her eyes look very big.
I felt like little Red Riding Hood  and saw the wolf with the big eyes
I asked her about the glasses, and told her what I thought she looked like.
She laughed, and told me her eyes looked that big , because her prescription now is so much stronger.
I can see much better now , and I like my new glasses.

When we went home , I was still thinking about the strong glasses grandma was wearing.
I asked my mother , that when I looked at grandmas  and your glasses, what can a person see when they are not wearing their glasses ?
She explained to me that without wearing her glasses , sitting at home at the kitchen table , she would not be able to read the numbers or the letters on the calender hanging on the opposite wall.

When we came home , I sat down in the kitchen to look at the calender on the wall.
The numbers looked a little fuzzy , but I could read  the letters.
I was dissapointed I could read the letters , now I knew I did not need glasses.

Before going into grade 4 , my mother had made an eye appointment for our annual eye exam.
I was not very excited about going, every time it was the same .
The optometrist would tell me that my eyes were healthy , and I did not need glasses.
So what is the use going for another eye exam.

When we  entered the optical store , my mother went in first for her exam.
While waiting I walked around the store.
With all those beautiful glasses frames on display, I could not resist trying some of the frames.
The optician came over and suggested a frame that she thought would look good on me .
I tried the frame , and when I looked at myself , could not believe how different I looked .
I had never realized that wearing glasses would change my appearance that much, I liked that look.

When I had my eye exam , as usual the optometrist looked into my eyes with the bright light,
Next I had to read the letters on the wall.
I had no trouble with the first two lines , but ion the next line the letters were a little fuzzy ,, and I could hardly make out the next line.
The next surprise came when the optometrist put what looked like a big pair of glasses in front of my eyes.
I had to read the lines first with my right and then with my left eye.
When I had trouble reading the letters , I would hear a few clicks  and everything came into focus.
Then he asked me which is better 1 or 2  and so on.
The exam was so much more interesting  than the ones I had before , I enjoyed it.
When the optometrist was finished said , Ashley you are myopic and have some astigmatism and will need to wear glasses.
I could not believe it , my wish fulfilled , I was going to wear glasses.

The optometrist than talked to my mother and told her I should wear glasses.
She told me she was not surprised , she had noticed me squinting quite a bit lately.
With my mothers help we selected a real nice looking frame.

When I got my new glasses and put them on could not believe the fantastic feeling of seeing everything so nice and clear.
What a wonder full feeling.
When I saw my face ina mirror , could not believe how different I looked , more grown up,.
I sure like my new look.
Both my parents told me how nice I now look wearing glasses.
I am very proud of my glasses , I like the look and fell of them on my face.
I am so happy.when I go back to school I can show everybody my new glasses.

The next Sunday we went for a visit to my dad s brother.
I got all dressed up and proudly wore my new glasses.
When we arrived at my uncle s place ,my aunt complimented me how nice I look wearing glasses, I don t think my uncle noticed them he never said a word.
My aunt suggested I go and say hello to the boys they were in the T V room playing video games.
Both boys are a little older than me.

When I entered the room ,they both looked at me.and then I heard.
Ha, Ha, come and see miss Ashley 4 eyes ,
Look at the stupid glass she is wearing. 
We did not know you were blind Ashley.
I ran out from  the room in tears , took my glasses off and put them in my pocket. When my mother saw me she asked why I was not wearing my glasses.
I told her they were hurting me behind my ears.
Well we will have to get them adjusted.
We left shortly after , and I was glad to get away from those bullies.
On the way home I put my glasses back on and really appreciated my improved vision.

The following week ,it was back to school time.
Going to school I was wearing my glasses , when I came closer to the school, I took my glasses off .
I wanted to wear  my new glasses, and show them off , but did not want to hear any remarks ,like I got from my nephews.
When in my classroom , I noticed I could not see to well, and squinted so much I got a head ache.
For the next week I did not wear my glasses in school, I was so afraid somebody would make a nasty remark.
It all changed , when my class mate Kelley told everybody that she had  an eye exam, and she will be wearing glasses now.
I am picking my glasses up to day after school and will be wearing the tomorrow.
Now I had the opportunity.so I told everyone , that I also would be wearing new glasses to morrow.
So the next day at school both Kelley and I wore our glasses. 
Our class mates told both of us that they liked them , and a few wanted to try them.
I was so happy there were no nasty comments, and now could enjoy wearing my glasses.

The next year when I had an eye exam , I had an increase in my prescription
I liked the improved vision when i put on my new glasses.
But it certainly was not as exciting as the improvement in my  vision , when I put on my first pair of glasses, it was fantatic.
