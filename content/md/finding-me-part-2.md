Finding ME 2 /6
 I found my reading glasses on the bedside table,

I made my way back to the lounge. The light was better in that room.
As I put my reading glasses on it seemed very strange only be able to read out of one eye but it was so much easier to see the phone message. Gone had the double vision 

The message was from Annabelle, I lit another cigarette and let it hang from my mouth, as I read her messages.I was taking long drags on my cigarette and shaking,
She wants to come and see me after lunch

Linda started calling me I quickly changed my glasses and picked up my cane.

Linda was sitting on the floor it front of the TV 
Her eyes seemed so tiny looking though her thick lens.

"Mummy why is there smoke coming out of you nose"

I had been practicing exhaling out of my nose and in my rush I had forgotten I still had a cigarette in my mouth .

"Mummy will tell you when you are older dear"

I went to take her glasses off to wash her face she screamed "Mummy I need my glasses,".

It was time to get ready for Annabell's visit I showered  and choose a nice dress,
My husband never liked me wearing makeup,but he was away and I just felt I wanted to look special,
My sight is so poor now that I found it hard to focus close,I just hoped it look nice.

I was sitting waiting for Annabelle my heart was racing,I so wanted a cigarette but was afraid I would smell of it,

What was happening to me,I have never had this strange feeling before.
I had many boyfriends before I was married,but this feeling is different.

How should I greet her, my mind was racing and my heart was beating, should I shake hands or a kiss on the cheek or a hug.

The lights flashed, it was the door she has arrived.
We're is my cane?

I opened the door,she looked wonderful,she was wearing a beautiful pair of bright red glasses the lens were bulging out in the middle making her eyes look even bigger than I remembered seeing yesterday.her bright red lipstick tasted so nice as she kissed me our thick glasses clashed together.as she pressed her breasts against mine,then I suddenly felt her tongue pushing into my mouth.

As we broke for air we both looked at each other,I stutterd "I have been thinking of you all night"

I took hold of her hand and guided her to the settee.

"Where shall I put your cane"I stammered.
"If it's ok I would like to keep it beside me"

"Would you like tea or coffee or a glass of wine"

"A glass of wine would be nice I think we can toast to our new relationship"

My mind was racing agan? What new relationship did she mean.

It was difficult carrying the tray with one hand and using my cane with the other ,I put the tray down and started to open the wine. 

Annabell looked at me "Why don't you put your reading glasses on I'm sure you will see better to open the wine"

I reach over to the side board and picked them up, are you sure you don't mind seeing me wearing them"

Annabelle smiled"Of course not,Come here let me put them on for you"

She gently took my distance  glasses off. Without my glasses on I felt completely naked and totallyVulnerable,I had never let anybody else do this before.except when having my eyes tested,and that was different.

"Wait I need to put my own reading glasses on as well "Annable said
I heard the click of her glasses case open,my heart was racing again.

As she came close to me her breath felt warm.
She slowly put my reading glasses on,now I could see ,her eyes they look so big and beautiful.

"There is that better, I know you liked seeing me wearing MY reading glasses and my big eyes"

I notice Annabelle looking down at the tray.
In my haste I had left the packet of cigarettes there..

Annabelle looked surprised."Do YOU smoke Amber"

I felt guilty and could feel myself going bright red.

"Um NO NO um what I mean is I never used to, I hated the thought of smoking ,my husband used to try to force me to try but I always refused.
"Then when I came back from getting my new glasses I was so nervous of what he would think of me wearing my new glasses with such thick lens, he always insisted I wear myodisc lens ,even though it was hard to manage looking through those tiny 22m circle,I get frightened when he is angry"
"I wanted to please him so I thought I would try a cigarette just to please him.It made me cough a lot,but I did fell a little calmer so,a little later I tried another this time I tried a menthol it did not make me cough as much, but I did not like the cold taste in my mouth and I didn't get the same calming feeling.so I tried another Marlboro red. This time I had a cup of coffee with it"
I tried to do some cleaning to keep me calm ,but it did not help so I kept going back and lighting another until the packet was empty"
"I felt happier and light headed also I thougt he would be pleased to see me smoking now ,after always refusing to'

"but he did not seemed interested in me; he just said what are those thick things you are wearing"

"Do you like smoking now Amber"

"Yes I'm afraid to admit it but I do,I never thought I would say that"

" What about you,Do you smoke Annabelle"

"No I Don't . But if you want to smoke it's ok with me"

"Thank you it helps the stress so much,I'm afraid I'm addicted already"

"You should not be stressed when you are with me"

"I love your new Glasses that you got yesterday with the thick lens,they look much sexier than seeing you looking though those tiny circles"

My face went red she said my eyes looked sexy 

Annabelle smiled 
"My father made me a pair of myodisc lens when I was 12 he thought they would make me look less disabled, they were ok as the circles were large so I could see ok , but each year my sight got worse the circles got smaller 35 mm next 28mm then 22mm finally my father had a special pair made with 15mm ,

"When I was 18 I went to study at university”
"In my 3rd year we started doing practical work, we had to use C39 blanks because of the cost,we were split into pairs and each had to test the others eyes,my working partner was shocked when she saw the results, both of my eyes  were over plus 28 now"
"Even though she had perfect eyesight she would still have to make a pair for herself and wear them full time for the rest of the term to understand what it was like to wear glasses,so without telling her what  I had done I added a minus 1.00 she could still just read line 7 on the test card with these lens in the test frame and I told her she was a little myopic ,she was surprised but did not question it."
"Because of my high prescription I asked if I could use a thinner lens blank,This was refused as they only had C39 blanks"
"I did not fit the lens in the frame correctly so all the lens pertruded out of the front like 2 paper weights ,but I loved not looking thought the 2 little myodsc circles,so since then I have always worn C39 lens mounted forwards then I can wear false eyelashes"


Annabelle watched me intensely as light the cigarette,I took several long drags and before slowly exhaling.

"Have you ever tried smoking Annabelle"

"No my father would never let me try"

I moved closer to Annabell,I took a long slow drag on the cigarette and instead of inhaling it deep into my lungs I let the smoke drift slowly out ,I saw Annabelle’s nose twitch as the smoke reached her nostrils  I took a second even longer drag before exhaling it towards her.As the smoke cleared I could see her coughing a little and her eyes were watering.

"Open your lips I will hold the cigarette, now close your lips and you just suck a little ,now blow the smoke out”
.
Annabelle pulled a funny face and coughed a lot.

"Try again,slower this time,that's better*

Annabelle coughed again.

I looked at her bright red lipstick on the filter.

I had to put the cigarette back in my mouth, the taste of her lipstick sent shiffers down my body

Annabelle relaxed her lips as I placed the cigarette back between them.

"This time I will let go and after you sucked in,then
you take the cigarette out yourself  when you are ready and you hold it"

Haha " hold it between your 2 fingers "

I picked up another cigarette and lit it.

"Watch me. Thats better,now inhale the smoke a little longer this time"

,Don't tell my father I feel like a noughty school girl haha"

"Once more then that's enough ,I never smoke it close to the filter"

Annabelle looked at me and smiled "I feel light headed and a little drunk"

"You sit there and relax I will get us a coffee and some canapés"

,,"Let me put your distance back on for you or you will fall over "she said 

It was so nice Annabelle taking my glasses off again, it was something I had never let my husband do.All I could see was a blurred face coming close to me and her warm lips kissing mine.
She then gently put my distance glasses on and adjusted my cochlear hearing aids behind my ears.

When I returned with the coffee Annabell had changed her glasses and her thick reading glasses laying on the coffee table ?

I must have been staring at them because Annabell said "Would you like to try them on, I could see you liked seeing me wearing them"
" You won't be able see anything through them but I could take a photo of you wearing then and send it to your WhatsApp"

"Ooo yesssss please I was shaking with excitement"

I could see nothing through the lens but the feeling was ecstatic I could smell Anabelle’s perfume on them she took several photos some from the front and some from the side then she pulled my hair to one side exposing my cochlear hearing aids and the magnet button holding it in place 

"There that's better you should wear your hair up,then l could decorate your aids for you in nice bright colours instead of them being black and you hiding them"

I did not want to take her glasses off.But Annabelle slowly lifted them off and replaced my reading glasses on me.

"There you can see the photo now "

I couldn't believe it was me.
My eyes looked so large and beautiful.I could see what see ment about my hair and and hearing aids 

I looked up to say thank you but gasped Annabell was wearing my thick distance glasses,she looked so different and sexy with her tiny eyes.

,"Your turn to take my picture now" She said with a smile.

I enjoyed taking several pictures of her,then she said ,”Will you hook one of your hearing aids over my ear and take another photo" 

"Thank you,can you put my reading glasses on for me then you can have your glasses back" she said 

I don't know what came over me but instead of doing that I put her thick reading glasses  back on and started kissing her.

We both just layed back on the settee and cuddled while still wearing each others glasses.

The door light suddenly flashed, we quickly put our own glasses on.
It was Annabelle's father he had come to collect her.

We never had time for a proper good bye.

I cleared the wine bottle and drinking glasses from the coffee table in the lounge picked up my reading glasses and the packet of cigarettes and took them with me to the bedroom incase Linda woke early.

I was just about to get into bed when I received a  message from Annabelle.

In the rush she had left her reading glasses behind,but as she needed them for work in the morning she had made herself another pair,so if I found them not to worry.

Also their shop closed at lunchtime tomorrow so she suggested she and her sister would come over,and we could go out for the afternoon together and her sister would look after Linda.

I went straight back into the lounge and found Annabelle”s glasses case and took it with me to the bedroom.

As soon as I got into bed I went to take my cochlear hearing aids off but I only had the left aid,the right was not there,then I remembered Annabelle had it on when I took her photo so it must have come off when we were laying on the settee,I would find it in the morning.
I put my own reading glasses on and excitedly opened Annabelle's case.

I loved the look of the sparkling lens,then I put one finger on the inside of the lens and the other on the outside as I moved my fingers across the lens they were flat at the back but I loved the feeling of the thick bulge in the middle at the front I kept moving my finger back across the lens the more I did it the more excited I got,it was as if I was playing with Annabelle’s breasts.
I could still smell Anabelle's perfume on them.

I HAD TO PUT THEM ON 

As soon as I felt the weight on my nose the adrenalin started rushing though my body,

I woke early the next morning,had it all been a dream,I lent over and put the bedside light on,everything was even more blurred than usual I went to rub my eyes then realised I still had Annabell reading glasses on.
My hand thumbled across the bedside table searching for my glasses,
My fingers touched the cigarette packet,I had never smoked in bed,but suddenly I wanted to while I still had Annabell's glasses on,I lit the cigarette layed back leaving it in my mouth taking long slow drags inhaling it deep into my lungs before exhaling it out of my nose I closed my eyes and imagined I was Annabelle,just before it was finished I took it out of my mouth and lit a second from it then a third.

I felt my phone vibrate it was another message coming in 
 Before I had time to take Annabell's glasses off I felt a tug on my arms ,it was Linda  she had one of my hearing aids in her hand  she knew I couldn't hear her without it.
I hooked it over my ear and placed the button on the magnet and turned it on.

"O Mummy you have such big brown eyes , why have your eyes grown so big  and you have smoke coming out of your nose again "

" Can I have big brown eyes like your"

"Just go into the kitchen Linda I will come and get your breakfast

I took one last longgg drag on the cigarette.
I took Annabell's glasses off and and put my own back on and picked up my cane 

I made our breakfast and sat down opposite Linda.

" Mummy were have your eyes gone they so tiny I can't see them ,please make you eyes big again" 

"Later I will dear I have a message to read" 

I put my own reading glasses on.

"O Mummy why have you only got one eye now?
"Can you make more smoke come out of your nose,like the dragon on TV,

"Later I will. Go and play with your toys now"

I was disappointed I thought it was from Annabelle,but it was from my husband.

He is going to America on business and is not not coming back.
He wants a divorce, and his secretary would call in about an hour to pick up a case that he had packed.

I did not know what to think if it had happened last week I would have been devastated 

But what did Annabell mean when she toasted to a new relationship.
