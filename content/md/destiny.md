“Analie got her braces off.  Doesn't she look cute? My colleague Dan said as he showed me a picture of his daughter.

“Yes, she does. Very nice.” I replied.

Wow, I thought as I looked at the picture. Analie is hot.  But then for me hot isn't always a real fox. Hot for me was what this 14 year old was going to grow into.  You see, I have a little fixation over girls who wear glasses, and as the glasses get stronger the girl becomes hotter and hotter. Of course she has to be attractive, and from the look of the picture Analie was a very attractive looking 14 year old.  And for a 14 year old her glasses were already quite strong. The cut in that showed light behind the lenses on both sides of her face was amazing, and with the glasses of today, with their high index lenses, the only way a person can really make an educated guess at the strength is through the cut in.  I was almost willing to bet that Analie already had a prescription of -15D in her latest glasses.  That was enough to make me very horny, but somehow it didn't seem right for a 46 year old guy to get an erection over the 14 year old daughter of a co worker.

My name is Kurt, and I work for an advertising firm on the 12th floor of an office building downtown. I am married to Sarah, my wife of 20 years. I have 2 children, a daughter Melissa who is almost 18, and a son David who is 15.  My wife is a schoolteacher, and really enjoys her work. Melissa has just started her first year at university, and is still living at home. David is in grade ten at the same high school his sister attended.  I am 46 years old, and Sarah is 2 years my junior. We have had a good marriage, and I have been very happy.  I golf a little, read a lot, and spend quite a bit of time on my computer. In other words, we are a pretty typical family in today’s world.

The only thing out of the ordinary is my little fascination for girls who wear glasses.  I was attracted to Sarah, who now wears mostly contact lenses, because of her glasses when we started dating.  And I was not as disappointed as a father probably should have been when our daughter Melissa needed glasses when she was around 10.  Sarah still has what I would consider a fairly mild prescription, and if I had known when I married her that her prescription would not likely increase much I might have changed my mind before the wedding.  Her prescription now, after 20 years of marriage is still just -5.50 x -0.75 x 82 for her right eye and – 5.75 x -0.50 x 120 for her left eye.   Melissa has a little higher prescription, but still hasn't quite broken the -10D mark, although I hope that university will give her a little push. David also needs glasses, but he won't wear them, as his prescription is only -0.50 and -0.75.  He might need to wear them once he gets his driver's license, but for now he refuses to, although I think he is interested in glasses because of the way he looks at his mother and his sister when they are wearing theirs.

I have a couple of other hobbies other than golf.  David and I build and repair computers.   I got hooked on fixing computers when David wanted to build himself a new gaming computer when he was around 10 years old. So he and I researched all the necessary components, and we ordered them online. When we finished we had a really dynamite computer for David.  Then we went on and built a new system for the house computer.  One of David's friends wanted to buy his gaming computer, and although we sold it for about the same money as it cost us to buy the components for his next computer we built we had fun, and learned a lot.  In the past 5 years we have built quite a few computers, and we learned even more about troubleshooting computer problems and error messages.  

My other hobby is one I keep pretty well to myself.  I mentioned that I had a fascination towards glasses, and I certainly do.  It is a little more than a fascination though, and it leans very strongly towards a fetish. I have managed to accumulate a fairly extensive collection of pictures of girls wearing glasses on my laptop.  I don't keep this out in the open for anyone to find, but I do have it hidden on my hard drive, readily accessible to anyone who knows where to look, but in an innocuous sounding file hidden within the operating system files.  I spend quite a bit of time searching the internet for pictures, and I have about 10 GB of these pictures. I also like reading stories about girls who wear glasses and have been fortunate enough to find a site or two that has some pretty good stories on there.  I consider this a pretty harmless hobby, although I have recently been experimenting with something called GOC that I learned about from reading some of the stories.

Today was not a GOC day though. I was with David, and we were over on the other side of the city at a very large computer component retailer purchasing a new motherboard for one of David's friends.  My cell phone gave a chirp, and I answered “Hello”.

“Kurt, its Dan.  Are you really busy today?” Dan asked.

“Not really. David and I are at Computer Shack, buying some parts.” I replied.

“That isn't too far from my place.  Now I don't feel so bad about asking.” Dan said.

“Asking what?” I asked hesitantly.

“Analie's computer froze up.  She was working on a presentation for school, and now we can't get the computer to start up at all.  At first we just get a blue screen, but now when it boots up we get something saying operating system not found.” Dan said.

“David and I will pop over and see if we can do something. But don't get your hopes up. That sounds like maybe the hard drive is pooched.  Do you know how old the computer is?” I questioned.

“Only about 2 years old.” Dan replied.

“Then it likely came with a sata drive.  They have 500GB sata's on sale for $59.95. I'll pick one up for you just in case and if we don't need it I can always use it. We will see you shortly.” I said.

“Thanks Kurt. I really hesitated calling you, but the usual guy who fixes our computers isn't open on the weekend. I remembered that you are always talking about computers around the office, so I took a chance and called.  I will be waiting for you.” Dan told me.

I was looking forward to seeing Analie in person. The picture Dan showed me a few weeks earlier had only whetted my appetite for another look, and now I was getting my chance.  I explained to David what we were going to do and he sort of grunted “Yeah, OK, whatever.” unenthusiastically.  I suspected that his enthusiasm would be heightened after a look at Analie, but I didn't know for sure.  I had asked him once why he didn't wear his glasses and his reply had been that they were not strong enough, and they looked like they were fake.  I didn't press the issue, but I sort of wondered if, like me, he liked the looks of glasses that had some obvious power to them.

On the short ride to Dan's house I discussed what Dan had told me with David. We had seen something that could have been like this once before.  A program had hung up, and the owner of the computer had thought the computer froze, so he shut it down using the power off button on the power supply.  Then when he started it up it had asked him to do a repair by inserting the systems disc, but the systems disc couldn't find any hard drive.  We managed to fix it by pulling the hard drive and checking it in an external hard drive case hooked to my laptop. Once the other computer recognized the hard drive we took off his important data just in case, and then put the hard drive back in the original case, did a F8, and had it boot up in safe mode. Then in safe mode we did a system restore.  This solved the problem, so the owner was thrilled.  David and I were not really sure what had gone on, but we were happy it was fixed, and the owner gave David $100.00, so David and I were pleased.  We had suggested that he buy an external hard drive for backup, and he did, so he was now fairly safe against a catastrophic failure.

When we got there Dan and Analie were waiting for us.  In person Analie was even more attractive to me than she was in her picture. And I could tell that David was very attracted to her as well.  After getting a good look at her glasses in person I revised my estimate downward a little.  Instead of -15D I suspected that these glasses were likely a bit closer to -14D.  But she looked so good wearing them that they looked like jewelry on her face.  The light shimmered off the flat fronts, and when she turned her head a little you could see an amazing number of power rings at the nose side of one lens and the temple side of the other lens.  I already knew that this was one shortsighted little lady, but she was a real beauty as well.

I let David and Analie head up to her room to look at her computer and Dan and I sat in the kitchen having a cup of coffee.

“Thanks for coming over right away Kurt. Analie was really distraught over the fact that all her work over the past week might be lost.” Dan said.

“No problem Dan. Like I said, David and I were already in the area and we didn't have anything better to do than help a friend.  Analie is quite pretty isn't she?  Did she get new glasses since you showed me her picture with her braces off?” I asked.

“No, those are the same ones. She had another increase in her prescription around the time she got her braces off, and had to get those glasses which were quite a bit stronger than her old glasses.  Natalie and I are a little worried about how bad her eyes are now.” Dan said.

“Does the doctor have anything to say about a reason for her eyesight getting so bad?” I asked.

“He just says that some kids have their eyeballs grow a lot longer than other kids. He isn't as worried about it as Nat and I are.” Dan said.

“Of course not. Analie isn't his daughter.  I would be worried if I was in your shoes.  Is there a family history of high myopia?” I asked.

“Natalie's grandmother had very bad eyes.  And one of her mother's sisters was extremely nearsighted before she died.  So it is possible there is a genetic influence there.” Dan said.

We had been taking for about half an hour when David and Analie came downstairs.  Analie had a great big smile on her face, and her minified eyes sparkled behind the strong lenses of her glasses.

“He fixed it Daddy. David fixed my computer and saved all my work!” Analie exclaimed excitedly.

I could tell that David had already been thanked. He had a trace of pinkish red lipstick on the top of his upper lip.  I kind of motioned to him to wipe it off, and he took the back of his hand and did just that.  Dan and Analie were both very grateful, and they wanted to pay us for coming over. I refused to take any money from Dan, and David refused payment as well, so they were very pleased.  I think I went up a few notches in Dan's estimation of me, and I know that David had a real in with Analie if he wanted it.  David is a good looking kid and is fairly tall for his age.

As we were leaving Analie gave David a big hug and another kiss, right in front of Dan. Dan didn't say a thing, other than thanks again.

“Analie is pretty cute isn't she?” I asked.

“Oh man, she is gorgeous Dad.” David replied.

“Pretty strong glasses though.” I said.

“So?  Mom and Melissa wear glasses, and Melissa's seem pretty strong too.” David said.

“As long as it doesn't bother you it doesn't bother me.” I replied.

I knew that David and Analie were talking on the phone a lot. I am sure that they were also texting and tweeting and were now friends on facebook. Actually I know they were friends on facebook, because I had gone into David's facebook account, found Analie's name and went into her site and I downloaded a bunch of pictures of her for my picture collection.  I would have loved to have her for a daughter in law, but if they were no longer friends I didn't want to loose the ability to save her pictures.

David took Analie to her junior high prom. He looked very nice in his tux, and I drove him over to pick Analie up and take them to the prom. She looked absolutely gorgeous.  David is around  6'1”, and quite slim. Analie was just the right height for him at around 5' 7” or so. With her high heels on she came up to within a couple of inches of his height.  I was a little surprised when I noticed that Analie was still wearing the same glasses she had just gotten a few months earlier instead of contact lenses, because I figured that no girl would wear glasses to her prom.  But I didn't say anything other than to dwell in her beauty. Actually I was pleased that her eyes had apparently not gotten any worse, because at age 15 her prescription was already very strong.

At the time of the prom David was very close to getting his type 1 license.  This meant that he could drive, but only by himself or with another fully licensed driver.  Soon after the prom David did get his license and now he could drive to Analie's, but they couldn't go anywhere unless Dan or Natalie, or I or Sarah was with him. And he couldn't drive on a freeway, but had to stay on the surface streets.  These restrictions stayed in effect until he got his type 2 license. The type 2 license allowed passengers and the use of freeways, but restricted this with a curfew of before midnight. Then he had to go no more than 5 years before he took his final test, but I was sure that he would pass as he already seemed to be a pretty good driver.  He had passed his eye test without wearing his glasses, so he continued not wearing them.

Now that David could drive himself around he spent a lot of time with Analie.  I am pretty sure that they ignored the restrictions about passengers, because they often were at the mall together, but I didn't ask and he didn't tell me.  I was very happy when he got his type 2 license after 90 days though.  He and Analie seemed to be perfect together. Now that he could drive her around they sometimes came over for Sunday dinner with us.  Sarah liked Analie a lot, but of course she wasn't happy that Analie wore such strong looking glasses. She couldn't say much though, because of her own glasses.  She did ask Analie if she had ever tried contact lenses one Sunday night, and Analie replied that she had, but she had very dry eyes, and the contacts were uncomfortable enough that she couldn't wear them after only 3 or 4 hours, so she had given up on them.  Melissa, who was now only a year away from graduation, also seemed to like Analie a lot and sometimes David, Analie, Melissa and Kevin, her current boyfriend, would all go out together.

Nothing much changed over the next year.  Melissa graduated from university and went off for a year of teacher training.  David was still spending his spare time with Analie, who had turned 16 and was now getting her drivers license.  Either Analie knew she needed new glasses before she went for the eye test for her license, or she had gone for her yearly exam because she ended up needing stronger lenses once again.  Now I was able to ask her what her prescription was, and she showed me her prescription that told me she was now -15.50D in both eyes. I thought it a little unusual that she was exactly the same in both eyes and had no astigmatism, but I suppose that is why she was able to get to 20/20 on the eye test for her license.  Her new glasses were a rectangular black plastic frame with wide temples on the outside and the inner side was a dark burgundy.  They looked wonderful on her.  Dan was going to pay for a very expensive pair of 1.74 plastic hi index lenses for her, but David told him not to waste his money.  He didn't mind Analie's glasses at all, and it didn't matter to him how thick they were. So Analie ended up with a 1.67 hi index lens, which made her lenses just a little thicker than they could have been.  But David was correct in thinking that spending any more money at this time would be a waste, because Analie would likely need another increase within a year or so.

David graduated from high school, and decided that he would take software engineering at the local university. I was pleased, because this was a cheaper option than leaving home to attend university in another state.  And to be quite truthful, I loved having David and Analie around. It wasn’t as if she hadn't been attractive before, but now she was a real looker.  Her face was a bit rounder than it was long which made her cheeks appear full, and her chin had a gentle curve that started below her ears and dropped to a small rounded point that made an area that framed her luscious lips. Her mouth was just the perfect size to fit in the area, and when she smiled her perfect white teeth and her partially opened lips made for an inviting friendly smile. Her long black hair was parted on the right side, and hung down on both sides of her face. Her glasses managed to catch the hair on the right side and stopped it from coming across in front of her face, and the hair on her left side draped down over her shoulders, with the hair to the front gently cascading down onto her left breast.  She had grown another inch and was 5'8” tall.  She was nicely endowed in the breast department, and she had well formed slim legs that ran right up into a perfectly formed rear end.  I could look at her for hours and I considered my son to be a lucky man.

Analie was in training to be a dispensing pharmacist, and she was now working at a pharmacy after school.  I had a suspicion that they were talking marriage as soon as David graduated from university, and I was going to happily give them my blessing.  I had dreamed of having Analie as a daughter in law ever since the first day David and I met her.  During the 4 years that David was in university Analie had 2 increases in her prescription, and the lenses in her newest pair of glasses were -18D.  I loved the increased power.  They didn't seem to increase her cut in that much, but the power rings were a lot deeper.  She had gotten a new frame as well, and now she had a black metal frame with wide open wire temples.  The frame was sort of a rectangular shape, but the corners were all rounded off, and the frame didn't look as harsh as it might have.

I often thought back to the day that Dan had called me.  By chance David and I had been together, and we had been able to go right over to their house. That, to me, was destiny.
