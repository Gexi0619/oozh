Boobs chapter 3


Because, my ankle, had healed enough, I was able to do some work again.
Trevor, did not really wanted to leave, and after making some business calls, during the day, would come, to help me with the chores, and enjoy, my mother's cooking, and he spends most of the nights with us. most likely, because, I like to sleep with him.


I started to notice, that my vision, needed attention again.
When I mentioned it, one night during our mealtime, both my mother and Trevor, suggested I should have another eye exam, my last exam, was over a year ago,.and I am still young.


At the eye exam, the optometrist, was surprised, that I needed, a full diopter increase, so now I will be wearing -6.50 lenses in my glasses, the best thing about it is, Trevor will love, the looks of my new glasses.


After I started to wear my new glasses, Trevor found, more excuses, to stay at our place, at night.
Well, like the saying goes, when you play with fire, you might get burned.
I missed my period, so will have to get ready, for another baby.


When, I told Trevor, that I might be pregnant, he said, wonderful, let's get married.
We had a small wedding , Amy was my bridesmaid, and Vicky, was the flower girl, and Trevor's brother Kevin, his best man.
We were married, in our local church, and the church ladies group, looked after the food, for our family dinner.
Trevor's brother Kevin, and my mother looked after the farm, and Vicky, while we had our 3 day, honeymoon


We settled down, and enjoyed our married life.
Trevor and I work like a team, the farm prospered, and with Trevor's part time selling job, we were financially very comfortable.


My pregnancy, went well, and this time, no more vision problems.
Time went fast, and I gave birth to a boy, who we named Archie.
Vicky, likes helping grandma, look after her brother.


Trevor, made plans, to build a barn, to store feed and fertilizer, so he can sell everything, from our home.
He will try, to do as much as possible himself, to cut down on labour costs
When, he was trying, to hammer some stakes in, for the out line of the new barn, he hit something very solid.
So he took a shovel, and started to dig, and found a steel box, in fairly new condition.
When he opened the box, almost fainted, it was full of money., he took the box to the house and showed it to me
My mother was there, when we counted the money, and we could not believe, there was over $ 20.000.00 dollars in there.
Who did the money belong to ?
Should we notify the police? 
My mother said, Amber, you and I, are get finally getting paid, for all the work we have done, in the past 20 years, around this farm.


It was not long after, Archie was born., I became, pregnant again, and we had another healthy boy, and we named him, Shawn, and a year later we had another girl, Sadie.
That is when I decided, enough, is enough, and had my tubes tied.


Trevor's business grew, better then expected, and to cut down, on our daily chores, we sold our dairy cows, and now have a beef herd, and chickens..and this will give us more time, to spend with our children.


Vicky, will be going to school, this fall, so we decided, to have her eyes examined again.
Archie sometimes looks, to me, as if he might be cross eyed, so he came with us.
After the exam, the doctor told me, that Vicky ,is a very low myopic, and if we wanted her to wear glasses, she would be wearing, -.0.50 lenses, 
Vicky was listening, and told me, she wants to wear glasses, just like mommy and daddy.
Archie, has to wear glasses, because he has a lazy eye, and astigmatism, he will need, to have another eye exam, about six months, to see if his present prescription, has to be changed.
Certainly, not what I had expected, I had expected that Archie might need to wear glasses, but I had not expected, Vicky, to be myopic already.
The children selected the frames that they liked, for their new glasses.
Vicky's would be ready in about, one hour, but Archie's glasses, would be mailed to us, as soon as they are ready.
We did some shopping, for Vicky's, new school clothes, before we went to pick up her glasses.
You, never saw a girl, more proud of her glasses, and could not wait to get home, to show Daddy, her new glasses.
When we came home, Trevor, when he saw Vicky, said,, is that you Vicky, you look so different, and more beautiful, than you did, at breakfast this morning, 
Yes daddy, I am Vicky, I wear glasses now..
When Archie's glasses came, he had a hard time, to get used to them, but he persevered, he wanted to wear his glasses, all the time, just like Vicky...


Our neighbour died of a heart attack, his wife Eleanor, was my mothers friend, so they decided, to live in Elanor's house, and Trevor, and I are now renting both farms from the ladies, to give them some extra income.
Both Vicky and Archie, are quite tall for their age, and now, are able to drive a tractor, and like to help us, when we need them.


Shawn, and Sadie, who is 5 years old now, had their eye exams, before going to school.
We were really surprised that both are Myopic now, and that Sadie, already has to wear a -1.25 prescription, we expect she will be a high myopic.
Like the rest of the family, both Shawn and Sadie, wear their glasses all the time. 


Looking at all our glasses wearing children, there is no doubt, that poor vision,
passes on, from one generation to the next. .
We are fortunate, they all, wear their glasses, without any complaints.

Trevor, and I are very fortunate, to have a healthy, beautiful glasses wearing family, and my mother agrees.
