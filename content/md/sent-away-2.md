New sent away 2a


The last 5 days have been so difficult my mouth has been so painful and my body has been craving for the nicotine,
Hidi has been smoking 30 a day and exhaling the smoke towards my open mouth 
Today I'm having  my first proper smoke since my teeth were removed.Hidi lit the cigarette for me,I found it very difficult to hold it in my loose floppy lips when I tried to suck on it was difficult to control it.
The hot smoke seemed to burn my gums where my teeth had once been and then the nicotine rushed straight into my lungs just like the first cigarette I ever smoked and I was coughing violently.
I was going to have to lean how to smoke again

The last 5 days Hidi had gone from only smoking 2 a day to over 30 some days to help me 

 Yesterday I noticed  she was walking around with a cigarette in the corner of her mouth taking long slow drags on it like I used to. I'm sure she smoked a whole 20 packet.
I'm still having to learn how to smoke without teeth

It's now 10 days since I started smoking again after having all my teeth out.holding the cigarette between my floppy lips is still the problem,the cigarettes here don't have filters and I hate having to keep taking it in and out  to have each drag but if I hold it tight in my lips I squeeze it to much and have drag harder on it.
If I hold it lighter it falls out of my lips so I now have problems exhaling.

Today Hidi has a surprise for me.
She remembers seeing her grandmother alway walking around with a tobacco pipe between her toothless gums.
I feel strangely excited about trying it.
So Hide says. She will go and ask her mother if there are any still in her house.
After lunch Hidi returned with a box full of 20 beautifully carved white clay pipes and 2 large jars  marked cherry tobacco.
I suggested Hidi tried first as she thought she remembered what her grandmother did.

A few minutes later she had loaded the 2 pipes with tobacco then took her dentures out and handed them to me to hold .
She was still wearing my glasses that she borrowed when going outside,you remember that I hated wearing them with the thick grotesque lens. But on her they somehow looked beautiful.
She placed the pipe between her soft lips. They looked so different now, not supported by the plastic gums of her false teeth.
She lit the pipe and took several short sucks on it until the bowl glowed bright red, then she seemed to take a long slow drag on it before  letting the beautiful cherry smelling smoke drift out of her nostrils, she then handed me the pipe before lighting the second clay pipe for herself
I loved the feel of the clay pipe between my clamped lips,there was no fear of it dropping out,I took several short sucks on the pipe,before taking my first long slow drag the taste of the cherry in my mouth was wonderful and the aroma was beautiful as the smoke drifted out of my nostrils
Hidi removed the glasses and placed them back on my nose, and said I looked beautiful wearing them
I looked in the mirror and felt more relaxed about wearing them now. Also, I was enjoying smoking my clay pipe.

We both have stopped smoking cigarettes and enjoy leaving our clay pipes in our mouths all day and relighting them from time to time,often just leaving them in our mouths between refilling them. It's comforting just sucking on them.

When I woke first I was surprised that we both still had our glasses on. As I looked at Hidi I realised I wanted us to live together,I had never dreamt of meeting another person with such bad eyesight as myself, let alone a girl.
My hands searched across the bedside table to find clock, 
Hidi was still asleep but what was that I could feel I then realised it was her false teeth,. My body was shaking with excitement.
I picked them up I had to see them properly so I silently made my way to the bathroom,I closed the door and put the light on.what was all that pink plastic for,and why did they look different.
I turned and Hidi was standing behind me,what could I say.
Hidi took them out of my hand and indicated for me to open my mouth
She then put the large pink plastic part into the roof of my mouth and pushed it upwards. I wanted to gag , then the smaller piece  into the bottom of my mouth.
Hidi pointed to the mirror.
I raised my head to look through the bottoms of my bifocals.

My saggy lips now looked tight, the lines above my mouth had vanished,my cheeks now looked full again I was amazed how different I looked when I smiled. I could see the pink plastic above the beautiful white teeth  but I was so relieved that the pink false gums did not bother me.
The problem was that with all that plastic in my mouth I couldn't talk and felt sick
Hidi  told me to keep them in all morning.

I had not seen Hidi without her dentures in before,it was now her that had the loose  floppy lips and saggy cheeks but I still found her sexy and attractive,her voice sounded so different
When lunch time arrived Hidi wanted the dentures back so she could eat her lunch. I was still only drinking soups.
It felt so strange  as she released the suction that was  holding the top denture in. my face instantly returned to that empty saggy look, my lips just hanging there.
I had to kiss Hidi before she put her false teeth back in.


It's 2 year since I left my aunt's house,but now that we are safe in England,Hidi and are living together as a couple.
The first thing I did was to go to the dentist to have a set of false teeth made.
The dentist explained that my gums had receded a lot because I had not been fitted with dentures sooner, so she would add extra thickness and height to the artificial gums above the false teeth.
When they arrived they were very big and bulky compared to what Hidi wore.the lady had a problem getting them into my mouth at first but after some adjustments they were in. The lady said to come back after 2 weeks for any further adjustments. On the way home I realised my bottom denture was loose and moving about in my mouth,but that did not mstter, as it wa so nice not being toothless any more.

As soon as I got home and looked in the mirror at my new smile I was surprised to see that when I closed My teeth together such a large amount of the plastic gum  showed.
Also When I smiled all the pink plastic above my false teeth showed so it was obvious that this 20 year old girl now wore full dentures.
But it was better than being toothless,even though my bottom denture seemed to float around in my mouth

I know my eyesight has deteriorated considerably since my last test.
When Hidi goes outside on her own she now  has to borrow my glasses, the  pair that I used to described as having those thick grotesque pieces of glass for lens,but I now love seeing Hidi wearing them.
 
Before we went for our eye tests we discussed the type of frame and lens that we would like the other to wear.

We both went in together for the test,
As the Dr had my old records he suggested he test me first.
He kept  trying different lens in the test frames but I was still unable the read the big E 
Next he but a large board closer to me,then added  even more lens into the test frame until I was able to read some of the larger letters he then changed the lens and gave me a card to hold and read 

Then he said that I was now legally blind in both eyes.  but there were special aids available to help me.

Next it was Hidi's turn.
I was totally shocked when she was also unable to read any of the letter on the snellen chart  then after testing her on the bigger board  he announced that she was also legally blind in her right eye and was classified as having low vision in her left eye and expected her also to become legally blind in both eyes in the next few years

He then explain that we both had macular degeneration and he would prescribe us with bioptic telescopic glasses
This is a combination of 2 small telescopes fitted Infront our new higher grade lens.
In Addition we would both need 2 additional pair of glasses to enable us to lead as normal a life as possible.

We were both in total shock when his assistant produced 2 white canes and handed us one each and explained that we were now registered as legally blind and the Dr advised us to use them when going out.

Then as usual I went up to the audiologist  department but this time Hidi came with me to be tested as well.
Thankfully there was very little change in my hearing so my aids only needed a little adjustment.

Hidi explained that she had never had a hearing test and the hearing aid she was wearing were my old aids and they helped a little.as she relied on lip reading a lot

I'm not sure what the results of her test was, but when she came out of the audiogenic room she was smiling and looking very happy, I could not believe what my eyes were seeing. She was now wearing 2 extremely large hearing aids similar to the one I wear in my right ear. Could her hearing be even worse than mine.

We had to wait 4 weeks for our glasses to be ready.

The time seemed to go so slowly while we waited  for our next appointment to collect our new glasses.

It was good that we both went for our appointments together it has made us more aware of each other disabilities.we also admitted our fetish feeling and our desire to be partners

 It felt very strange the first time we went out using our white canes,but now we find them very useful as people are more helpful.

When we arrived to collect our new glasses  I was very nervous,how thick and heavy were my new glasses going to be and what were the bioptic telescopic glasses  I had never heard of before.

Hidi must have realised that I was afraid of what we were going to have to wear now,so she offered to be fitted with her's first
The Doctor suggested we be fitted with our new distance glasses first to replace what we were now wearing.,
Hidi asked the doctor if I could put them on her.
I was surprised how light the large case felt  then as I opened the case my surprise turned to total shock. If I thought the glasses I was wearing were thick then compared to these, mine looked thin. The doctor said these were C39, plastic that's why they were so light  but the downside is that they are about 50% thicker than glass. My heart was thumping as I placed them on her nose,.
Her eyes looked tiny and close to her nose,as she turned sideways I noticed how much thicker her right lens  was compared to the left lens, I found that intriguing.
Hidi was so excited that she could see so much better and with much less weight on her nose she was not worried about the exstream thickness of the lenses.
The doctor handed Hidi a case with my new distance glasses in, I loved seeing Hidi wearing such thick lenses, but the thought of me having to wear lenses like them sent shivers down my spine.
When Hidi saw me wearing my new glasses would she have the same fetish feelings for me as  had now for her,or would she be horrified at my looks,I'm sure my glasses will be even thicker than hers.
As she placed them on my nose I was amazed how light  they felt
But I could feel the thick right lens touching my right check so I knew  they were much thicker than my  older glasses I was about to panic when Hidi said how beautiful I looked and I felt her gently squeeze my right breast.
Next the Doctor fitted our Franklin bifocals these were extremely heavy as they were made of glass  in addition my right  reading section of the lens contained a 10 out prism making that part of the lens even thicker and protruding further from the top section of the lens whereas the reading section of my left lens was thinner than the top section. I must have looked like a freak
Then the  Doctor went to make some adjustments to our telescopic glasses before he fitted them on us.

I was about to cry,
But Hidi told me I looked beautiful then i felt her soft  Hand inside my panties,the thick lens of our glasses were clashing together as we passionately kissed each other.
Then before I could stop myself I relished that my pants were all wet and sticky.

The Doctor returned carrying our bioptic telescopic glasses We both gasped, were we really going to have to wear those ugly things, the lens were as thick as our new distance glass but in addition they had a black telescope fitted to each lens
I dreaded the thought of wearing such hideous things.

After the doctor had fitted them and showed us how to use them we were both amazed how far we could see by looking through the telescopes
We put our new distance glasses back on and the Doctor ordered s taxi to take us to the park


As soon as we got there we sat down and quickly got our clay pipes out and were soon puffing  away happily we loved exhaling out of our noses towards each other we looked around there was nobody near so we both took our dentures out.we love the warm taste of cherry tobacco much better without all that plastic in our mouths 
Hidi suggested we try our telescopic glasses.it was amazing how far we could see.


    
The addrilin was rushing through our body's as we refilled our pipes. We both started puffing heaverly on them the air was soon full with the  beauty cherry smell
We quickly looked around again. There wasn't any body near so We couldn't stop ourselves, we had to pleasure each other

We decided to keep our telescopic glasses and walk home.

I'm sure people must have been staring and these 2 toothless girls puffing away on their clay pipes,and wearing these enormously thick glasses with the strange telescopic devices attached to them and tapping the ground Infront of themselves with their white canes.
We  Now wear our hair tied back,no reason to hide our large hearing aids and Hidi now wears the microphone box around her waist with bright red cables attach to the shoes on the bottom of both hearing aids
But we did not worry about other people are pants were wet and sticky and we were both happy.

Every night our fetich fantasys are played out.
First we light out clay pipes,after several long slow puffs we let them hang from the corners of our mouths, we need our hands for other things.
The air is filled with the aroma of our cherry tobacco smoke.
We always wear a different pair of glasses each night, even our telescopic glasses, we also both also love wearing each other's glasses. Some nights we wear our dentures other times taking them out and occasionally wearing each other's false teeth.
Then spending the next hour pleasuring each other, all the time we are enjoying puffing on our clay pipes
We now keep our hearing aids in all day and night only taking them out one at a time to change batteries

Life is perfect now




Much has changed since I last wrote 

Heidi and I have now been married for nearly 2 year.

About 6 months before we got married,we were both struggling with our hearing so the audiologist suggest it was time we were both fitted with cochlear implants for our right ears, it was amazing how much people said our speech improved. 
9 months later I received an implant for my left ear.

So when I remove them I'm TOTALLY Deaf now

Hidi said she did not want an implant in her left ear yet,as she could hear some sounds,but not speech,and felt that she was not ready to be TOTALY Deaf like me.
So she has a new extremely powerful aid with a large bright red amplifying box that she wears around her waist that has a cable attached to a shoe on the bottom of the hearing aid.it does make her hearing aid even larger,and together with the box around her waist even more notable then our cochlear implant aids.
She seems happy wearing that and I have a small Bluetooth microphone that I wear around my neck that feeds my voice directly into her amplifying box.

I almost forgot to say we both bought a selection of new pipes, they are all bight colours and have much larger bowls, so we don't have to fill them as often.

We had completely stopped smoking cigarettes for nearly a year,then one day we were invited to a garden party, In the rush to get ready we both thought the other had packed our tobacco pouches. It was only when we went to refill and light our pipes that we discovered we had no Tobacco.it then that we realised that we were normally smoking our pipes continually for most of the day.
Without the smell of the Tobacco from our pipes we noticed most people were smoking
All the tables  had packets of cigarettes on them.
I could not stop myself I quickly picked up a marlboro red,it was the first time I had held a cigarette between my lips since I got my false teeth
My hands were shaking as I struck the match,the excitement was overwhelming I took a long slow drag on the cigarette.it was the over a year since I had inhaled nicotine deep into my lungs with each long drag the addrilin was rushing faster and faster through my body,  I then realised  what I had been missing.
As I adjusted my telescopic lenses and squinted across the room I could see Hidi putting packets in her bag. I'm sure she had taken her dentures out, as I could see a cigarette hanging from the corner of her floppy lips.

We normal only wear our dentures on special occasions like today,I looked around,nobody seemed to be looking, so I quickly removed my top plate first, then my bottom denture,,without all that pink plastic gum above my false teeth, my lips instantly became floppy, luckily marlboro reds have a cork filter so I was able to hold them tighter between my wrinkled lips,without all that plastic of my dentures in my mouth the taste of the cigarette was wonderful.

That was how We started smoking Marlboro reds, we both try to  limit ourselves to 4 a day,but we instantly light a cigarette as soon as we wake then fill our pipes.

A few months ago I woke with a terrible pain in my right eye,Hidi rang for a taxi and I was rushed to hospital,I can't remember much about that day,but they said I had suddenly lost the sight in that eye and the only way to stop the pain was to remove that eye.
I now wear a Clear Conformer in the eye socket to keep it open, I don't like The feel of the prosthetic eye that was made for me.so for now I prefer the clear conformer. I have new glasses with just one telescope and a clear non-prescription lens for my right eye. They did ask if I wanted a fogged lens fitted on that side to hide the fact that my right eye had been removed ,but I could not think of a reason why I needed to hide that.

Hid has been luckier so far as the main problem she has is that light bothers her right eye so she has a very dark sun tinted lens for that eye, it was made in a rush for her while I was in the hospital so they used a C39 blank so I'm sure you can imagine the thickness of it with the extra 4 diopters added also when the glasses arrived they only had one telescopic lens fitted for her left eye like I have.
