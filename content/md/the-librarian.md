I remember another great college glasses story. There was this woman who worked in the library, who wore medium minus glasses, perhaps about -6 or so. She was pretty but not a knockout, in her mid-30's. One day she was working on the card catalog (remember those?) so I went over nearby, wearing my strong plus glasses, and pretended to look through my bifocals at the cards. She didn't seem to notice, so I did my usual trick of popping a lens out of the frame, struggling blindly to put it back in, and in short order she offered to help. That led to a good conversation, where she told me she'd broken her frames and the ones she was wearing were new, but using the old lenses. Back then, CR39 was the norm, so they had a bit of thickness. She said several times that I had quite the glasses. We dated for a month or two, and we always made love with glasses on. One day I was peering through my bifocals as we kissed, and she said, "I love it when you look through your bifocals. It really turns me on!"

I don't think she had a fetish exactly, but she clearly liked that I wore strong glasses, and liked wearing glasses herself. She never wore contacts, and several times said that her glasses were just part of her. She had this endearing habit of waking up, grabbing the first pair of glasses she could feel on the nightstand, holding them very close to her eyes, then either putting them on if they were hers, or putting them on me if they were mine. She once commented that I am so blind I have to feel around the nightstand to find my glasses. But I have to say, wearing contacts to bed and falling asleep in them is not only uncomfortable, but risky. 

We eventually stopped seeing each other. Aside from the glasses thing, I found her kind of boring.
