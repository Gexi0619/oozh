Becoming a recent widower left me free to resume my hobby of searching for ladies who wear glasses.  While I had not stopped looking during my wife’s illness, I had not had any time to devote myself properly to the search. And now, even though I was what could be considered available, I still had a catch and release policy in place.
 
During my late wife’s illness, Friday afternoons, and Saturday and Sunday mornings had shown themselves to be the best time to look around the local grocery stores. The traffic was much heavier at those times, and on the weekends the working ladies that would normally be contact lens wearers often went out shopping while wearing their glasses.
 
My most recent outing led me to a major chain grocery on a Friday afternoon.  I think many grocery stores are laid out in a similar manner, with fruits and vegetables being the first section you come to and this one is no exception.  I looked around to see if I could spot any ladies wearing glasses with a decent prescription, and my eyes fell on a lady in her mid-40’s or so. She was not unattractive, but since it was winter the bulky clothing most people, including her, were wearing did not allow me to get a proper estimation of her figure. All I could tell was that she did not appear to be overweight, and that is sort of what I am looking for.
 
I set my course through the fruits and vegetables in a way that would bring me facing her as we walked the aisles.  I didn’t attempt to speak to her but just observed her and gave her a friendly smile as we passed. Her glasses were moderately strong. They were in the frame style of the early to mid 2000’s and were what I call a wire frame in the style of an expanded rectangle, where the upper and lower portions of the rims bulged to be much wider in the center than the nose and the temple edges. Another way of describing them would be to say that they were an oval shape with the temple and the nose edges cut off straight. Her lenses were flat, and there was about 3/8” of edge thickness showing at the temple edges.  But I suspected that the lenses were not hi index, and were no more than about -10D from the amount of cut in and the power rings that I could see.
 
I was about to tell her that is was nice to see someone wearing glasses that were not so huge that they looked like they occupied a person’s complete face. I call the new style of large emo frames “glasses with legs”, because when you look at the face of a person wearing these big frames your view is of a pair of glasses with some sort of person behind them. The glasses completely dominate their face and you really can’t tell if the person is attractive or not. My personal point of view, which is not shared with many of the others in the community of men who like girls wearing glasses, is that glasses should be an accessory like a piece of fine jewelry, and should accent, not dominate a ladies appearance. I was planning to tell her that I liked her glasses because they accented her appearance, however she fooled me and did not come back down the next aisle to face me again.
 
I had completed my selections for that part of the store, and I headed for the far end so that I could use my other trick of walking against the crowd.  I ran across the lady I had thought I would like to talk to down there, looking around as if she was searching for something that should have been located there. I smiled and told her that they were always moving product around so we could not find it, and she spoke to me to agree with my statement. I was close enough to her for long enough that I could smell the cigarette smoke emanating from her clothing, and when she spoke she had a very grating voice. That was 2 strikes, and I was rapidly out of there to proceed with my search.
 
I went up and down a couple more aisles. There were a couple of ladies wearing glasses, but nothing worth pursuing as the best looking one had her husband with her. As I rounded the corner to head down the next aisle I spotted a lady wearing glasses that was holding a bottle of salad dressing almost up to her forehead so that she could read the ingredients through that area above the rims of her glasses, which she had pulled down slightly.
 
“They make the print so small it is almost impossible to read.” I said to her.
 
She looked my way and I could see her eyes blinking and trying to focus, but her glasses were pulled down too far and she then pushed them back into place so she could see if I was someone she knew. Her glasses were a black framed plastic, and were in the style of the wayfarer frames. They looked good, and they didn’t appear to be obviously thick, but from the power rings and the cut in I could tell that she had a fairly strong prescription, possibly in the -14D range, which to me is a very acceptable prescription.
 
“I can’t see distance and now I can’t see up close. I guess I need to get bifocals,” came her reply.
 
“I have had progressive multifocals for a few years now. They work reasonably well.” I answered.
 
“Normally I wear my contacts, but I needed some items for dinner and I had already taken my lenses out.  I have a pair of reading glasses to wear when I have my lenses in,” she said.
 
“Those glasses look very nice on you. You should just get new lenses with the progressive reading section.” I replied.
 
“Well, thank you for the compliment, but I hate wearing glasses. They are so thick.”
 
“Actually they don’t look thick at all. I bet you had a lot thicker glasses when you were younger.” I said.
 
“You are correct. I got the thinnest lenses I could buy for these glasses. They were ridiculously expensive and I have only had them for a little over a year. That is why I hate the thoughts of having to get new ones.  I suppose I will have to bite the bullet soon though,” she responded.
 
We had run out of easy conversation, and I let her go her own way, although I kept her in sight as much as I possibly could. I watched her repeat pulling down her glasses and looking at the lists of ingredients and the expiry dates of things over the top of the frames with the objects held very close to her face. I could also tell that she was probably not very comfortable with her vision with her glasses as she seemed a little disoriented and kept looking around and attempting to focus on the different aisles.  I could tell when she had pretty well finished her shopping and she headed towards the check out.  I had grabbed everything I needed by now so I headed for the cashiers as well.  Normally I choose a particular young glasses wearing lady cashier in this store, but the lady I was following headed for the shortest lineup and I fell in behind her. We chatted about nothing as she and I both loaded up the conveyer, and the cashier rang her order up. She was still packing up her stuff off the second belt by the time I started to pack mine, and she was only a minute or so ahead of me when she went out to the car park. I watched her put her stuff into the trunk of a white Lexus that was parked fairly close to my car and I managed to be putting my cart back in line just before she brought hers back.  I told her it was nice chatting with her, and I wished her well, but I didn’t think it was the right time to exchange names as I didn’t want to scare her off.
 
I returned to the same store at the same time the following Friday to do my weekly shopping. Again I looked around, but as usual I didn’t spot any females worthy of my attention. As I finished my shopping and was walking to my car I thought I saw a white Lexus enter the parking lot, but it parked at the other end of the lot and I could not be sure that the lady getting out of the car was the same one I had met the week before. I had no reason to return to the store, and I had some frozen stuff I needed to get home with.
 
The week after I went to do my shopping about half an hour later than I had the week before. I cruised the parking lot first, but didn’t see a white Lexus anywhere. So I went in and did most of my shopping, leaving the frozen goods section for last. I wandered back to the produce section and there she was, looking at the avacado’s.  She must have had her contact lenses in as she was not wearing glasses. I watched her from afar as she left the produce section and went into the grocery part of the store.  I then headed for the other end of the first aisle, and as she came towards me I saw that she had a pair of glasses up on top of her head. She stopped, picked a box of the shelf and pulled her glasses down to read the label. She was still reading as I drew my cart closer.
 
“I see you must have your contacts in today.” I said as she looked up at me over the top of her readers.
 
“Oh, Hi.  Yes, I find it so much easier wearing my readers over my contacts.” She said.
 
“I bet you haven’t done anything about ordering a pair of bifocals either have you.” I told her.
 
“No, and I don’t think I will. As long as I can wear contacts I will keep doing it this way,” was her answer.
 
“As long as you take proper care while you are wearing contacts you should be able to wear them for a long time. Have you thought about having one of those new operations where they put the contacts right into your eyes?” I asked.
 
“I have thought about it, but my eye doctor tells me that those operations often lead to premature development of cataracts, and at my age I am getting close to where I will have cataracts form naturally. So I will wait a while and see what happens,” she said.
 
“Good luck, and nice to see you again.” I said
 
I pushed my cart to the frozen section to finish my shopping. I had realized during my little chat that there was no way that lady would ever go without her contacts, so there was no use in my wasting my time.
