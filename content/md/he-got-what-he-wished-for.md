Brandon graduated from university , he is now a doctor of optometry.
He likes wearing his - 3.25 glasses , and also likes doing G O C , which his girlfriend did not like , so she dumped him.
Now the most important thing he has to do is open his own optical practice , and finding a glasses loving girlfriend.

There was a family get together, to celebrate his mothers birthday.
When talking about his plans with his brother Jim [ who owns a trucking business]
Jim mentioned that there is a fast growing town, it is called Mill Town, about 50 K.M. from here
It is a fast growing busy town, in a prosperous farming area.
There are some large elevators, farm equipment dealers, a feed mill, hotel, movie theater  and a number of stores.
I know there are medical doctors and an emergency clinic , but I never noticed an optical store .
It might be worthwhile to go and have a look.

Brandon drove to Mill Town, to have a look around.
He first went to the doctors office , he liked to have a chat with them.
When he entered the doctors office was greeted by an absolute stunning looking girl.
A well build brunette ,wearing about - 4.00 glasses , and the most beautiful smile.
Brandon introduced himself and asked if the doctors were in 
No, I am sorry both doctors are out on calls, I am the nurse here.
My name is Sandy , may I be of some help?
Brandon told her  that he is an optometrist , and investigating to see if there is any need for an optical practice.
O,Yes , we certainly need one, the closest optical outlet  is more than 50 K M from here.
I am sure there are a great number of people in this area who never had an eye exam , and should have one.
Brandon who liked Sandy s look and personality , invited her to have lunch with him.
When they were finished with their lunch , Brandon knew just about everything there was to know about the town.
the people that live there , and the surrounding area.
She also mentioned the doctors would be in the office later.

Realizing he might have found the right place to open a practice, went to a real estate office ,
The realtor showed Brandon what was available for rent,
Brandon decided on a good size store with living quarters above.
The main floor could be easily converted into a nice size reception and display area, an examination room and a lab.
He met with a building contractor and discussed his plans with him, of how he would like it to look when finished.
The contractor told him it should not take longer than 3 weeks to do the job, so you can make arrangements to open your practice

When Brandon went back to the doctors office ,Sandy smiled and and introduced him to doctor David , a handsome glasses wearing man , and doctor Charles who was married and much older.
After some pleasant conversation , David invited Brandon for a beer at the hotel, so they could get to know each other better.
After a couple of beers , and discussing Brandon s plans , Brando asked David about Sandy.
Sandy is single, I have asked her  several for a date , but no luck.
You are welcome to ask her.
Thank you, I will.

After returning home , Brandon placed an ad for an optician.He also arranged with an optical supply company for 
the examination equipment he would need.
Brandon was happy the way everything went.

From the replies for an optician , and after interviewing the applicants, Brandon decided on a recent graduate .
Ashley a peasant glasses wearing young lady , who did not object to moving to Mill Town.

The next time Brandon went to see how his new office was coming along, he invited Ashley to come with him.
This would give her a chance to become familiar with the area and find a place to live.
When they saw the office were  very pleased how good it tarted to look.
He went to the doctors office to invite Sandy to have lunch with them.

At lunch Ashley and Sandy got along so well, that Sandy told Ashley she was welcome to move in with her.
There was lots of room in her apartment, she could move in any time.
Ashley was all excited , she liked Sandy , they would get along well.

About a week later Brandon moved into his apartment over hi new office.
All his new equipment and displays arrived .
With some technical help all the optical equipment was installed
Ashley looked after the frame display.
Since they would be opening soon , Brandon placed an ad in the local paper, announcing the opening of his practice.

Brandon went to see Sandy , he asked her if she would like to go out with him for a dte.
Sandy smiled, thanked him for asking ,and said no thank you.
Brandon could not believe she turned him down, he wondered why.

When Brandon and Ashley were putting the finishing touches on the displays,
  he asked Ashley if she might have any idea why Sandy turned him down when he asked her for a date.
Sandy prefers Girls, did you not know? That is why I moved in with her.
Well Brandon had his answer , 2 beautiful glasses wearing girls he could not have.

After the optical practice opened , Brandon and Ashley were soon very busy with a surprisingly large number of appointments for eye exams.
It was surprising how many out of town people came for exams. 
One of them a girl in her mid twenties , made quite an impression on Brandon.
He thought she was beautiful.
When he examined her eyes was surprised she had never worn glasses.
When he was finished and told her that her prescription read - 2,00 for the right and - 1 .75 for the left eye.
Great, I hope that means I have to wear glasses?
I always wanted to wear glasses.
Yes you should wear glasses.
Could YOU  please help me to chose a nice frame?
Brandon gladly assisted her chose  a frame.
After he took all the measurements , told her to come back in 3 days and her glasses would be ready.

3 days later she came to pick up her glasses.
I am Megan James , I hope my glasses are ready.?
Brandon had been looking forward to this moment 

Hello miss James , please sit down and we will get your glasses.
When Brandon finished fitting the glasses , he asked miss James to look around.
Holy SH... , I can see everything , every little detail this is unbelievable 
Doctor I am so happy , you did such a wonderful job , I would like to buy you a cup of coffee.
Brandon accepted, he liked miss James.  

While they were having coffee, Brandon asked miss  James to call him Brandon.
Sure I will, you call me Megan.
They talked so long , that Ashley had to come and get him , so he would be in time for his next appointment,
Brandon asked Megan for a date which she accepted.
They had a number of dates after, Megan was what Brandon needed , she was fun and she loved glasses.

On a next date with Megan, Brandon wore his - 20.00 G O C
When Megan saw him, told him she loved his glasses with such strong lenses.How can you wear such strong glasses?
Brandon then told her about G O C .
Megan said that sounds like fun, I would love to try it.
Well I think that can be arranged.
After fitting Megan with proper contact lenses, and showing her how to put them in and take them out .
selected a new frame for her - 15.00 lenses.

The next date Megan came to Brandon s apartment .
He was wearing his G O C ., Megan smiled and gave him a kiss.
Are my glasses ready?
Yes they are right here , and handed Megan her glasses. 
Sandy looked them over , they are fantastic, I love the look of the lenses.
She put the on, wow they are strong , I can t see a thing.
You better put in your contacts first 
After putting in her contacts, she put the glasses on.
Oh my , I love the wonderful feeling I get when wearing these glasses.
Everything looks so nice and clear and further away, this is exciting .
She went to the mirror to see what she looked like, and loved the rings , and the lookk of her eyes behind the strong lenses.

Wearing their G O C , went for a walk around town and then for a cup of coffee at the hotel.
Megan loved the way people looked at them wearing glasses with such strong lenses.
After their walk went back to Brandon s apartment and had a great time,

Brando now realizes he is a very lucky man.
He now has a nice busy ,optical business , and the kind of glasses loving girl he had been looking for to spend the rest of his life with.
HOW LUCKY CAN YOU GET?
