This true story is about a girl who was my classmate for 11 years.
 I got to know her when we wew 8 years old. I realized that she has a unique shape of eyes, a bit like Chinese people but just a bit. I realized other things 3 years later.
We were 11 when I realized she is a bit cross-eyed, no lazy eye, just a slight esotropia in both eyes. I also realized that when she is looking at things close, her eyes are looking very crossed, almost fully crossed. During these months she started complaining about her eyesight and she also said that she see crossed when she’s opening her eyes in the morning. 
A bit later she got her first pair of glasses. It was -1. After some months she started to struggle when she took off her glasses. She was not squinting but it was easily recognizable that she is not comfortable without glasses. I think it was accomodation to glasses and worsening eyes, too. 
About a year after she got her first glasses, we were in the swimming pool and we visited the buffet. She forgot to bring her glasses so she was complaining that she can’t see the menu board on the wall (the letters were big and the distance was just 1-2 meters). That was a sign that her eyes worsened quite a lot, she needs new glasses.
A bit later she got a -2 glasses. After that she told me she can’t see without glasses. She couldn’t even see the time on the analog clock from about 3 meters. She had these glasses for about 3 years. During the last months she started squinting hard even with her glasses on. 
After that she got a -2.5 glasses. It is quite strange that how much squinting this half diopter difference caused. She stopped hard squinting with the new glasses but her eyes remained a bit squinty. About once a week I saw that she took off her glasses and she was squinting very hard. It was mostly not straining to see, it was just a reflex squinting. Her eyes looked half closed every time. 
She had these glasses during the secondary school. She couldn’t see perfectly with them but maybe stronger  ones would have been worse. Since secondary school we haven’t met each other quite often but I know that she has new glasses with about -3 diopters. Looking at her lower eyelids, it is recogniseable that she is squinting quite often. She is the same slightly cross-eyed as she was.
