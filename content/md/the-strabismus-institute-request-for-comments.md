This story is turning out to a Novella or maybe a Serial, rather than the short story I intended.  I created the characters and they seem to have taken on a life of their own (I read somewhere,  that occasionally happens).  I've got some ideas about where I want the story to go, but as I said, it seems to be getting out of hand.  

I tend to be a bit long winded as some of you know, but I am afraid that while I am having fun writing it, you may find it a waste of valuable time and space.  Please let me know if you want me to continue.  I really value your inputs, critical or complementary.

Thanks,

Cactus
