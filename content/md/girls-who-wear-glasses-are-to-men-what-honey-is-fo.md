My name is Kelley, I will be going to high school next fall.
I am an only child, but I am lucky to have Ashley, who has been my friend since grade one, she is like a sister to me.
My mother wears glasses, she told me she is nearsighted, and I understand that she can t wear contact lenses. 
I wonder why she always complains about her glasses, I think she looks very nice wearing glasses.
She has told me so many times how she hates wearing glasses, and that she hopes I do not inherit her myopia.
Since I have heard this so often,  I now even dread the thoughts of having to wear glasses.

A few of my classmates are wearing glasses now, and I can t understand why they don t seem to mind having to wear glasses.
They look as if they are proud of wearing their glasses, and I have noticed some boys really looking at them as if they like their glasses wearing look.
I cannot believe it.  

My mother insisted I take a self improvement course, to teach me how to properly use make up, learn to walk like a lady, and look my very best at all times.
Fortunately Ashley is taking the course to, so together we can practice what we learned.
Not long after, we both now feel so secure and beautiful, and are now sure we will be getting lots of requests for dates.

We have another school dance.
Both Ashley and I are looking our best, and are full of expectations.
We are hoping that Kevin and Trevor, the best looking and most popular guys around are going to ask us for a dance.
We patiently wait, but no luck so far.
When a couple of other guys asked us to dance, we told them we were waiting for our dates.
We went to get some drinks and when looking around, noticed the guys we were expecting to ask us,  dancing with our glasses wearing classmates.
What was going on?
The next time we were asked to dance we excepted, we just did not want to sit around by ourselves all night.
On the way home that night we were very unhappy, we could not believe that we were not asked to dance by either Kevin or Trevor, that they seemed to prefer to dance with girls who wore glasses.

To day coming home from school I could not believe my eyes, my mother was not wearing her glasses.
She asked me how I liked her new look, no glasses.
She told me she had lasik and no more glasses for her.
When I really had a good look at her face, could see bags under her eyes, and what are called crows feet at the corners of her eyes, that never were noticeable when she wore her glasses.
To make her feel good, I told her she looked beautiful, because I hated to tell her that she always  looked much better when wearing glasses.


A few weeks later my dad came home wearing glasses.
I must say he looks great wearing glasses, it gives him a sophisticated look.
He told me that the doctor had recommended he get get an eye exam, because he thought eyestrain caused his headaches, and the doctor was right.
My mother did not know what to say, but had to admit that dad looked very handsome wearing glasses.
I noticed that dad seemed very comfortable wearing glasses, he wore them all the time and I can t believe he did not complain.
Never before had I realized how wearing glasses could make a person look so different and more attractive.
When Ashley came over to see me and noticed my dad wearing glasses said, wow he looks handsome,
and when she saw my mother said, I think she looked much nicer when she was wearing glasses. 
We never realized glasses can change a persons look that much.

A few weeks later when we were at our self improvement course, the teacher asked us if we would like to participate at a promotional fashion show at the mall, wearing outfits and accessories supplied by the stores.
The show would be on Friday night and Saturday afternoon.
We told our teacher we loved to participate, and would be at the mall for fittings on Wednesday night.
Ashley and I loved the opportunity, and both of us felt very important doing a real fashion show.

We both were fitted with three outfits to model, and were asked to come back the following night
to get our jewelery and other accessories.
It did not take long for the jewelry part, but to our surprise were send to the optical store to pick out some glasses, I did not like that idea at all, me wearing glasses?
This was the first time I was in an optical store.
When I entered the optical store, could not believe the selection of frames available.
A very pleasant lady told us she was the optician and would suggest the frames we were to wear.
After she looked at my facial features handed me some frames to try to she could see which frame looked best.
When I looked in the mirror to see what I looked like wearing glasses, could not believe my eyes.
I loved my studious and grown up look.
The optician told me I have perfect facial features, and look fantastic wearing glasses.
Ashley looked beautiful wearing glasses, and told me if she can look that good wearing glasses, she would not mind having to wear glasses.
On the way home we wondered what our parents were going to say when they see us wearing glasses at the show.
We decided to surprise them.

That night at home wondered, would I like to wear glasses,  I sure liked the way I looked wearing them.
Al I can hear Ashley say, if you can look that good wearing glasses, why would you not want to wear them?
Ashley sure liked the way she looked wearing glasses.

The fashion show was well received by the audience.
Every time Ashley and I were up on the stage and wore our glasses, we got applause, 
After the second show on Saturday, when we returned the glasses to the optical store, the owner was so pleased with our performance, that he gave both of us a gift certificate for a pair of glasses.
Both Ashley and I wondered what to do with it.

Coming home that night my mother was not very happy about me wearing glasses.
She told me I should have refused, did they not know that glasses spoil you good looks?
My dad thought both Ashley and I had looked very nice and had done a very good job modeling.


Life is like a jig saw puzzle every piece falls into place sometime.
Both Ashley and I talked about our gift certificate and what to do with it.
We found out soon after.
At school they offered a driving course, but you had to have a beginners permit to participate.
So after school my mother dropped us of at the license office.
After we gave the clerk all our details, were told to take the vision test.
I could not believe it when I was told to come back after I had an eye exam.
Ashley had a little trouble, but passed the test and got her beginners license.
When I told my mother she was very upset, she was sure they were wrong.
Since we had no choice she made an appointment for an eye exam.
I was not to upset, I think that now kind of like the idea of having to wear glasses.

I had my eye exam, and was not surprised when I was prescribed glasses.
The optician assisted me in getting a real nice looking frame.
When the glasses were ready and I tried them, was stunned by the improvement in my vision.
I had always thought I had perfect vision
Because I like my new look, and the improved vision, I don t mind having to wear glasses.
When I got together with Ashley, she said you are so lucky having to wear glasses,  you look beautiful,
I am so jealous.
Off course she had to try my glasses.
When she put them on said, wow, I can see everything so nice and clear, I am going to keep them.
I told her she could not, and then suggested we take her gift certificate for glasses to the optical store,
and tell them you gave it to me for a second pair. 
When the glasses are ready I will give them to you, so you can have a pair of glasses to.

We went to the optical store and it did not Ashley long to find a frame she really liked.
We were told the glasses would be ready in a couple of hours.
While we were waiting, sitting at the food court, Trevor and Kevin came over.
Kelley you look fantastic, I like your glasses.
Thank you, I like them, we are sitting here waiting for Ashley s glasses to be ready.
They asked us if we mind if they sat with us, and if they could get us some refreshments.
We were thrilled, we got the attention from the guys we wanted.
After some pleasant conversation, we told them it was time to go and get Ashley s glasses.
They told us they would like to wait for us.

When we went to get the glasses, and after I got them fitted, the optician put the glasses in a case and handed them to me.
On the way back to the food court I handed Ashley the glasses, she could not put them on fast enough.
I never saw Ashley this happy.
When we got back to our table, both guys told Ashley how nice she looked.
When we were ready to go home they asked us for a date.
Of course we accepted.

Ashley and I have been wearing our glasses for a few weeks now, and love them so much, we would not want to be without them.
We like our improved vision, our new look,  that the glasses are comfortable to wear, 
we also feel more confident, and like being noticed. 
We both realize that a girl wearing glasses, is to men, what honey is for a bee.
