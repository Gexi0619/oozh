The Girls  [ Lesbian story ]

Chapter 1

Katie.

I am the youngest in our family .
Since my last report card was not very good, my parents had a meeting with my teacher.
She thought I might have a vision problem and suggested an  eye exam.
This kind of surprised my parents ,  my older sister and brothers did not have any vision problems.
I had my eye exam and the optometrist told me that I am hyperopic and have some astigmatism.
My mother helped me select a nice frame , that we both liked.
The optician told me to wear my glasses all the time, so I get used to wearing glasses.
I received a lot of comments when I came home .
I liked the looks of my new glasses , and the way the lenses made my eyes look a bit larger.
I can  now see perfect when wearing my glasses .
Jenny my friend wanted to try  my glasses. 
After she put the glasses on realized that reading was so much easier, she sure liked that .
She now wanted glasses just like mine, and would talk to her parents.
After having an eye exam Jenny was prescribed glasses for hyperopia and astigmatism correction.
We  both  have just  about the same prescription .
There are some other kids in our class  starting to wear glasses now , I understand they are myopic.


I am going to high school now.
My body is changing fast , and I am  now  start to look more  like a young woman.
I just got new glasses , that I really like ,   I feel beautiful.
Jenny is still my  friend , and is a very pretty glasses wearing girl.
She is very popular with the boys, and has a lot of dates.
I have lots of chances to go out with boys. 
I  had a few dates , but boys don t seem to excite me.
My preference seems to be girls who wear glasses.

A couple of years later I met Kim ,  we soon became best friends.
We like each others company , and often go out together .  
To day when I went to pick up Kim ,she was wearing a brand new pair of glasses .
I got all wet when I looked at her , she looked so beautiful , I even got so excited I kissed her.
Kim  laughed , my new looks  turned you  on ?
Yes , you look so nice , I want to hug you .
I would like that , let s  go to my bedroom .
As soon as Kim closed the door I took her in my arms and kissed her .
She kissed me back and before we knew it we were lying on the bed  
pleasuring each other.

Time goes fast ,and I have finished high school .
When the summer break is finished ,  I  go to college to become an optician.


Chapter 2
Ashley

I am an only child .
Because my father and mother are divorced ,  I live with my mother.
 I am in grade three, I like school and I am a good student.
My friend Megan just started to wear glasses.
She told me she is myopic and has trouble reading what is on the blackboard,
She let me try her glasses when we were in the bathroom, and when I looked at myself in the mirror , really liked the way I looked wearing glasses.
I sure  would like to wear glasses , I love that look.
My mother wears glasses, I think she is myopic , her glasses look very strong.
She got new glasses last week ,   I think she looks beautiful wearing glasses.

A couple of weeks later , I was home alone .
I was nosy and  rummaged through some dresser  drawers in the spare room.
There were some old photographs ,I had never seen before ,  so I had a good look at them .
Lucky for  me , I also found some glasses cases.
I opened them up , and tried wearing the glasses .
Most of the glasses were too strong and I could not see much.
I noticed there was a gold metal frame I had not tried.
When I put them on , and looked around ,  could see reasonably well.
I liked the looks of the gold framed glasses when I looked in the mirror .
Now I had a pair of glasses I liked and could wear whenever I wanted.
A short time later I could see perfect when wearing the glasses.
I started to take the glasses to school and wearing them in class.
Megan  asked me about the glasses, and I told her I had to wear glasses when at school.
She tried the glasses and told me they were stronger than hers.
Then she asked me , how come I did not have to wear  my glasses  all the time, like she did.
Because nobody told me, I have  to wear my  glasses all the time.
A couple of months later I had trouble seeing properly, when I was not wearing the  glasses.
I mentioned to my mother that I had trouble reading what was on the blackboard.
Being myopic herself , she did not hesitate to make  an appointment for me to have my eyes examined.
I am now myopic , my prescription reads – 1.75 for the right and -1.50 for the left eye.
When I put my new glasses on , love the  improved vision and my new look .


Lately my mother brings home some of her girl friends . 
I noticed , they all seem to wear glasses.
I asked her about it.
My mother told me to she prefers  the looks of women  who wear glasses .
I  started  to  wonder is she a lesbian , because she only has girl friends .

Lately my body has changed a lot , and  now I look more  like a woman
I am proud of my  breasts , my figure , my hair  and love my new look.
My glasses prescription is now – 3.75 for the right and -3.50 for the left eye .
My new lenses show some rings and I like that.
New glasses, new body and nice hair, I love it.

My mother has a new girl friend.
Her name is Carla , a beautiful glasses wearing woman.
When she comes over I noticed , as soon as  they meet they kiss each other ,and  of course they always end up in  mothers bedroom.
Now I am sure she is a lesbian.

To day my mother told me Carla is moving into our house next weekend..
She has a daughter Andrea who is a little older than you.
I am sure that you will like Andrea ,  she will be like a big sister to you.
So the follwing weekend Carla and Andrea moved in.
Andrea is a lovely looking , glasses wearing young woman .
She is  easy  to get along with , I like her . 

Acouple of weeks later ,when Andrea and I were in my bedroom.
She asked me if she could try my glasses , she loves the looks of them   
I would like to see what I look like wearing your glasses .
I handed her my glasses,  she put them on  and looked at herself.
The glasses sure look great,I love the looks of them ,but  your stronger lenses  do something to me.
I asked what wearing the stronger lenses did to her.
Andrea said , the stronger lenses give me  such a nice exciting feeling , I have  to pleasure myself .
That is when I learned  just about all there was to know of how  to masturbate. 
It was not long after,  that  once and a while we would sleep together ,  I sure  liked it.
Now I know why our parents like sleeping  together.

We both are good students and go to the same high school .
For show both of us have occasional dates with boys .
Sometimes we go to a school dance ,but  we both  like girls better.

Time goes fast and soon we will be graduating.
I am looking forward to summer.
Getting ready for college is exciting.
First , my annual eye exam , and as expected another  increase in my  prescription.
The prescription now reads – 5.00 fot the right and – 4.75 for the left eye, and a bit of astigmatism.
My new glasses look fantastic, I love the rings showing in the lenses and the increased thickness 
of  the edges.
I feel beautiful now and ready to go to college.


Chapter 3

Katie  is going to college .

There sure is a lot of difference between going to high school and college.
The  many different lectures ,so many new faces, male and female  and trying to make some  friends.
In the optical course are some pleasant girls , and  most of them wear glasses .
I  have not met  anyone I liked well enough to be real close  friends with.
I am very confused, I know I like girls , better than boys. 
Am I a lesbian ?
I think I might be lesbian, the sexual experience I had  with Kim ,my high school friend had been  very enjoyable.
I like nothing better than looking at girls who wear glasses , they sure turn me on.


To day, when  I was looking at the bulletin board , noticed there is a meeting of the L B G T club
I decided I should go to their meeting and find out  more about my sexual  feelings .
I was very shy when I went into the meeting room.
There were a number of guys and girls talking and having a good time.
A very pleasant glasses wearing girl greeted me , and asked if she could help me .
I told her about me questioning my sexuality . 
I told her that when I see  girls wearing glasses ,they always turn me on.
After some discussion ,she  told me  , it sounds to me you are a lesbian . 
I am sure ,when  you  meet  the girl of your  dreams you will know , and then you will have a real friend.

I enjoy college life  , there is always something going on.
My studies went well , and I am looking forward to our summer break,
I will be working at Jones Optical again for the summer , to gain more experience.


Working at an  optical store is so enjoyable .
I have assisted a lot of former High school students select new frames . 
After they come to pick up their new glasses  ,and  they are happy with their new look, is so satisfying.
To day while I was  re arranging some displays , a very attractive glasses wearing young  woman came into the store.
When I went over to see her , she told me she was Ashley Brown, for her 10 ,00  o clock eye exam.
Being a new patient , I asked her to fill out the neccesary paper work.
After  she handed me the information ,while she was waiting for her eye exam, we had a very pleasant conversation.
She told me she went to college , and studied business.
What a surprise we were both  going to the same college .
We both wondered why we had not met before.

After  her eye exam was finished , Ashley handed me her prescription , and asked me to help her select a new frame. 
I looked at the prescription and it read, right eye – 5.25. left eye – 5.00 and some astigmatism.
I suggested I select some frames , she try the frames and I would take a picture, so she could see what she would look like wearing the frame.
Ashley loved the idea, and after trying the frames and looking at the pictures , decided on a frame that she liked.
You will look gorgeous wearing that frame , I am sure you will love your new glasses.
The optician took all the measurements , and Ashley s glasses would be ready later in the  afternoon.
I could not wait for Ashley to come in and try her new glasses ,she will look so beautiful. 
I sure like that girl.

Ashley s glasses are ready .
We will be closing the store in  about ½ hour . 
The door opened and there was Ashley all smiles.
When she  sat down and I handed her the glasses.
She put the glasses on and looked at herself in the mirror.
Thank you Katie for helping me with selecting  these  glasses , they look absolutely fantastic.
Ashley you look so beautiful , I could sit and look at you forever.
Sounds good , after you close the store we will go for a drink , and you can look at me all night.
Well I sure  like to do that . 

Ashley took Katie to a gay night club . 
She was pretty sure Katie was the kind of girl who liked girls.
When they arrived at the club ,made themselves comfortable in a booth,  ordered drinks and some food.
There was so much  to talk about , glasses , college ,and after  a while  Ashley told Katie all about her mother , and her life at home.
Katie now realized she might have found the girl of her dreams.
Ashley would you mind if I sit beside you ?
I thought you wanted to look at my new glasses all night ? 
Well , I looked at the front , now  I would like to see what they look like from the side.
Katie slid in beside Ashley , and soon they were holding hands. 
I am so glad I changed my eye doctor, besides a fantastic pair of glasses and better vision,
I met you , and would  like to be your friend.
Well I love  you to be my friend, and I gave her a kiss.
We laughed, kissed , giggled and had a wonderful time together.
When it was time to go home ,Ashley asked me to stay at her place for the night.
I told her  I like to , but should let my mother know I am not coming home to night.
I phoned my mother and told her I would be staying at a friends house.
She told me to bring my friend home sometime , she would like to meet my friend.

When we arrived at Ashley s home her mother and Carla were having a drink.
After the introductions , Ashley s mother told her how nice she looked wearing her new glasses.
Then after some small talk , said to  Ashley you know where all the toys are, we are going to bed.
Good night girls. 

It sure was a night to remember.
I had sex with an  experienced  woman , and found out  how enjoyable it is.

Before  I went back to college , I brought Ashley home to meet my family.
They all thought it was great ,to have a close friend as a room mate.
After Ashley had gone home , my mother wanted to talk to me.
She asked me about Ashley and our relationship., you never brought a boy home.
I told her she was right , that  I loved Ashley , I am lesbian.
Well you are still my daughter, and I love you., you let me know when you are ready to inform the rest off the family.

When  Ashley and I were back at college , we went to the L B G T meeting .
I met the  pleasant glasses wearing girl  I had talked to the first time I went.
She remembered me.
I told her you were right, I am a lesbian., and that someday would find he girl of my dreams . 
Meet  Ashley the girl of my dreams ,and  now my best friend.

After graduating both Ashley and I started to work in the same city.
We now have a nice apartment and live as a very happy couple.

Nic, Aug 2016 .
