I'm sharing a real treat today, a professionally made story and a very long one which you can read the free translation of here. Manga means japanese comic so you still have to read from right to left.  The writer must be one of us and doesn't know it (yet)

The story really should be titled "going without glasses" as that's what she does most of the time but there's also lots of squinting, having to read things really close, breaking of glasses and seemingly she goes without them a lot as an excuse to get her face closer to the boy she's falling in love with her who is in turn falling for her also from looking after her when she's unable to see. 

As far as romance goes, for anyone who isn't into anime or manga and doesnt understand japanese culture it will seem extremely frustrating how slowly things progress and how long it takes for anything to even "escalate".  The Japanese compared to westerners are a massive bundle of nerves, insecurity and repressed feelings even though by asian standards the whole thing is very adorable and wholesome. I would not blame any of us who are initiated to just get bored of the whole thing and not finish despite the different plays on glasses as things get more intimate from a trust and emotional standpoint.

It's also popular enough that it's being made into an animated series now,  I've included the trailer links below below

https://www.mangaread.org/manga/the-gir ... P1K-gSW6bo - it's easier to read in list style so you can see all pages on one page per chapter but dont forget each "chapter" is at least around 12-15 pages and some chapters are multiple parts.
