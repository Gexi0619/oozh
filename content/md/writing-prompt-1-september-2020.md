I'd like to propose a new and potentially interesting exercise for both the readers and the writers here. I will post a short writing prompt below, which everyone and anyone may use as a springboard for their imagination and continue the story along any lines that they wish. Then, everyone can post their versions here and we can enjoy seeing where different writers take the prompt.

I propose that anyone can write a story of any length at all, from very short to very long, depending on your mood. The only limitation is that the story has to begin with the prompt, and that it has to be posted before the end of September 2020. Maybe next month we can have a different prompt if the exercise proves interesting and fruitful.

So without further ado, here is the writing prompt:

My blood froze instantly as I realized too late that my secret would be revealed, and I couldn't stop her anymore. She had just opened the cabinet in my bedroom which kept hidden my huge collection of prescription glasses, an undeniable testament to my optical obsession. There was no way I could get away without telling her. I could only wait in dread and apprehension for her reaction.
