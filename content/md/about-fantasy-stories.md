Now, we have the first story here. The Romance on the Subway. When I was thinking and discussing this thread with Val and Specs4ever, we agreed the thread needed a kick to start. Somebody must be the first to send a story. I believe the Specs4ever's story is a good start and it can also be a great inspiration for more authors to write and publish their works here. 

Don't be afraid of the Big Competitor Specs4Ever, the stories he has written will remain at the story site, they are not going to spill over into here. although Specs4ever will post some short stories here, this place is for all other authors who feel like writing stories about glasses and vision and do not want to send them to, sometimes too critical, Bobby to let them published at Bobby's site. Let us hope to see some new and young authors, as well as some old ones who have published yet. 

So, ignite your imagination, start up your dreams and write. We have not run out of ideas, nor we will ever do, because different people experience different events. One action is perceived by two people in two different ways. 

Mind a few simple rules:

Any story should have an intiating action, a rising action, a turning point (climax) and falling action (conclusion).   

The story published here should be in English.   

If you publish a story in other language than English, provide a translation into English.    

Write whatever you want, just stick to the topic of this forum: glasses, vision.    

Feel free writing short comments, reactions or even alternate versions of the stories.   

Be polite, mind spelling and grammar, don't drink and drive (after all, you can always smoke and fly)
