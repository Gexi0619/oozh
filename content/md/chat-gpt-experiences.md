I signed up for fun to Chat GPT, and I am impressed of it's capability.
I see that now there are two options. one free, with some limitations and a paid one.  
I tried the free one, of course.
I asked it two write stories, and it did.

Q1:  Please write a story about girl who starts to wear her mother's glasses and becomes myopic.

Story 1:   
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She was an adventurous and curious young girl, who loved to explore the world around her. One day, while playing in her mother's room, she stumbled upon a pair of old glasses that her mother no longer used. They were big and had thick lenses, unlike any glasses she had ever seen before.
Intrigued, Lily decided to try them on. To her surprise, the world looked different through the glasses. Everything was clearer, and the colors were more vivid. She felt like she could see the world in a whole new way.
As she continued to wear her mother's glasses, she started to notice that she couldn't see things as well without them. She would struggle to read signs from a distance and couldn't see small objects without squinting. Eventually, she realized that she was becoming myopic, or nearsighted.
Lily was upset. She didn't want to wear glasses all the time, but she couldn't see without them. She went to the optometrist and was prescribed with a pair of glasses with the right prescription for her myopia.
At first, Lily was self-conscious about wearing glasses, but as she got used to them, she realized that they made her look smart and stylish. She also discovered that her glasses allowed her to see the world more clearly and experience more of the beauty around her.
Lily learned to embrace her glasses and appreciate the new perspective they gave her. She no longer saw them as a hindrance but as a tool that allowed her to see the world in a whole new way.

Story 2:
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Emily. She lived a happy life with her parents and was known for her sharp eyesight. Emily had never needed glasses before and took pride in her ability to see everything clearly.
One day, while going through her mother's things, Emily came across a pair of glasses that her mother no longer wore. She put them on as a joke and was surprised to find that everything looked blurry. Despite the fact that she could hardly see, Emily found herself drawn to the glasses. She started wearing them all the time, even when she didn't need them.
As time went by, Emily's eyes started to adjust to the glasses and she found herself relying on them more and more. She started to notice that without the glasses, things looked even blurrier than before. Emily went to the eye doctor and found out that she had become myopic. The doctor explained that by forcing her eyes to work harder with the glasses, Emily's eyesight had weakened.
Emily was shocked and saddened by the news. She realized that she had let her fascination with the glasses take over and that it had caused her to lose her sharp eyesight. Emily decided to start wearing the correct prescription glasses, but she also made a promise to herself to always be careful about what she put in front of her eyes.
From then on, Emily took care of her eyes and enjoyed the world around her in a new way. She learned that sometimes, the things we want the most can end up hurting us. But, with the right care and attention, we can overcome our obstacles and see the world more clearly.


Q2:  Please write a story two sister's who wear each other's glasses and contacts

Story 1:  
Once upon a time, there were two sisters named Lily and Rose. They were inseparable and loved to do everything together. One day, while they were playing dress up, they stumbled upon each other's glasses.
Lily, who wore contacts, was fascinated by Rose's glasses and put them on. Rose, who normally wore glasses, tried on Lily's contacts. They both burst out laughing at how silly they looked and decided to switch for the day.
As the day went on, they found that they could see things much clearer through each other's glasses and contacts. They decided to switch every now and then, just for fun.
However, they soon discovered that wearing glasses over their contacts was causing them to have headaches and eye strain. They went to the eye doctor, who warned them about the dangers of wearing glasses and contacts together.
Despite the warnings, the sisters couldn't resist the temptation of trying on each other's glasses and contacts. They continued to switch, but were careful to take breaks and not wear them for too long.
One day, while they were out on a hike, they realized that they had forgotten to bring their contacts with them. They were forced to wear their glasses all day, but they found that they could see things much clearer than they ever had before.
From that day on, the sisters continued to wear each other's glasses and contacts, but they were more mindful of how long they wore them. They learned that sometimes it's okay to try new things and embrace differences, but it's important to listen to our bodies and take care of our health.
The sisters lived happily ever after, always finding new ways to have fun and embrace their differences.

Story 2:
Once upon a time, there were two sisters named Lily and Rose. They were inseparable and did everything together. One day, they were getting ready for school and Lily noticed that Rose was wearing her glasses.
"Hey, those are my glasses," Lily said.
"Oh, I know," Rose replied with a mischievous grin. "I just wanted to see what it was like to wear them for a day."
Lily chuckled and said, "Fine, but you have to wear my contacts for a day too."
So, they switched glasses and contact lenses for the day and found that each other's vision aids were surprisingly comfortable. From then on, they made it a habit to switch glasses and contact lenses every now and then, just for fun.
However, they soon discovered that wearing the wrong prescription glasses or contact lenses could lead to some interesting situations. They both had trouble seeing things clearly and found themselves bumping into things. But they never let it get them down and always found humor in their mishaps.
One day, they decided to try wearing their glasses and contact lenses at the same time. The results were hilarious, with both sisters stumbling and tripping over their own feet. But they had a blast and laughed about it for days.
The sisters learned that it's important to have the right vision aids for your eyes, but they also realized that sometimes it's fun to switch things up and try new things. They continued to switch glasses and contact lenses and cherished the memories they made along the way.

Ava thought it wouldn't be a big deal and went ahead with the performance, wearing the stronger glasses.
As the performance went on, Ava found that she was having trouble seeing things that were far away. She also noticed that she was becoming increasingly dependent on the glasses. She couldn't imagine taking them off and having to see the world without their help.

However, as the play continued, she started to become more and more dependent on the glasses. She found that she was having trouble seeing things clearly without them, even when she was offstage.

Eventually, Lily's eyesight worsened, and she found that she couldn't see clearly without the glasses. She was forced to wear them all the time, even when she wasn't performing.
Lily was devastated. She realized that she had become dependent on the glasses and that her eyesight might never be the same again. She learned a valuable lesson about the importance of taking care of her eyes and listening to the advice of those who cared about her.
