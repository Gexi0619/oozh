The Ladies Club


Hi, I am Sharon, I am married to my high school sweetheart Peter, a handsome well build dark haired guy.
Peter has a real good job, and has good potential, of future promotions.
Besides work, the company he works for, encourages their employees to get involved with volunteer work, and being community minded.
Peter, is now a member, of a service club, and enjoys the work they do, and spends a lot of time helping, where needed.
Because, of the type of job Peter has, I am sometimes invited to special outings, and for those occasions, I have to look my best, so Peter can be proud of me. 
I am, a brunette, with a lot of long, dark blonde wavy hair, brown eyes, a good figure, and my husband says beautiful legs, and average height.
Because, we do not have any family yet, I have time, to do volunteer work. 
At least one day a week, I help out at a day care center.
I enjoy, working with the children, who are to young for kindergarten, and this way, I get experience,
looking after children this young.
To day, I noticed little Trixie is wearing glasses, when her mother came to pick her up, to go home, she told me that Trixie, has a lazy eye, and might have to wear a patch, to make the lazy eye work harder.
I now understand, that after talking to Trixie's mother, that a child should have a first full eye exam at 3 year's of age, if a pediatrician has not spotted any eye problems before.
Like they say, you learn something new, everyday.
Spending some time at the computer, I am now getting some idea about vision.
Never having had an eye exam, I had no idea, how they examine an eye, I looked it up on the computer, and it has made me more curious, and attentive, of anybody wearing glasses.


That night talking with Peter, I told him about Trixie's glasses, and what I had read about.
Well that is valuable information, and might be important, when we have a family.
I forgot to tell you, that you are invited, to join the ladies group, of our service club.
Well, I would like that, since we moved here, I have not met to many females my age, and we sure can use some nice friends.


I went to the next service club, ladies meeting, and I was very impressed.
The ladies I met, were friendly, which gave me a very comfortable feeling.
I met Amy, a beautiful red head, and Tanya, a glasses wearing, beautiful girl, with nice shoulder length blond hair, who has the nicest smile, showing her nice white teeth.
The three of us had a very pleasant conversation, and a little while later, Tanya, asked me, because I am not working, if I would be interested, helping her with a new program, that is just about to start.
The program, is vision screening, at our local public schools, for the children, in grade one, three, and five
Dr. Jones, an optometrist, who is also a service club member, will teach us, the proper way to check.
for obvious vision problems.
I told her, that it sounds, like a very interesting project, and told her that I would like to help, and that I am looking forward to work with her..
We made arrangements to meet at her place, to further discus the project.


When, I arrived, at Tanya's place, she greeted me with her beautiful big smile, and invited me in.
After we were seated, enjoying a cup of coffee, Tanya, asked me, if I had any knowledge about vision.
I told her, that after, seeing Trixie coming to daycare care wearing glasses, had made me inquisitive about vision. and after reading about vision, and eyes, I now know the difference between, myopia, and hyperopia,
I never had an eye exam, and after reading about it on the compute, have some some idea, how it is done.
I have often wondered, what it is like, having to wear glasses, I never tried them.
I think you look fantastic wearing glasses.
Tanya, laughed, well thank you, I enjoy wearing glasses, I am a low myopic,.
Wearing glasses improves your vision, they are comfortable to wear, and believe it or not, a lot of men love the look of a glasses wearing girl.
That made me laugh, I don't believe it.
Yes, it is true, my husband is one of them.
You will be surprised how good, a woman can look wearing glasses., when wearing the right frame.
Well, I have no idea, what I would look like wearing glasses, I have never tried anybody's glasses.
Then she asked me if I would like to try her glasses?
Yes, I would like to, so she handed me her glasses, I looked them over, and slowly put them on.
I looked around, and everything looked a little fuzzy, how do I look wearing glasses?
You look very nice, there is a mirror in the hallway, so you can have a look at yourself.
I slowly walked over to the mirror, and could not believe it, when I looked at myself, I would never have believed, I could look so good wearing glasses.
Tanya, I never realized, I could look this good wearing glasses, I like the look of my eyes behind the lenses, the frame, feels comfortable on my face, but my vision, is a bit blurry.
Then, I took the glasses of, and handed them back to Tanya.
How long have you been wearing glasses? 
This is my second pair, I started about three years ago, I will show you my first pair, I really loved that frame.
A couple of minutes later she came back, and handed me, her first pair of glasses.
I loved the color, and shape of the frame, I put the glasses on, and walked over to the mirror, to have a good look at my self.
What surprised me most was, that now I could see everything, so nice and clear wearing the glasses, and loved my new look.
Now, I can understand why, a person would not mind, having to wear glasses, when you can look this good.
Then Tanya said, before I forget, we have an appointment with Dr. Jones, who will instruct us how to get a proper vision evaluation, when we do the vision screening, it will be to morrow, after he closes his office at 6


When Peter came home, I told him about my day, and that to morrow night, I have to go with Tanya, to Dr. Jones office, who will instruct us, on how to do the vision screening, for the school program.
I also told him about trying Tanya's glasses, and how surprised I was, that I could look so good wearing the glasses.
That's is very interesting, I like to see that sometime.
Well, Peter wants to see me wearing the glasses sometime, I have to remember that.


Dr. Jones, showed us, how to put a wall chart, and to make sure, the student is the proper distance from the chart.
While being examined, the best way, to have the student cover one eye, and then the other, and if in doubt, repeat the procedure.
We had to practice on each other, to show we can do the test the right way.
When, Tanya, tested me, I had a hard time, reading the required lines on the chart, I barely passed the test, that really surprised me.
After receiving some more instruction, and tips, Dr. Jones told us, if there were any more questions, to get in touch with him.
On the way home we discussed what we had learned.
I told Tanya, that when I had told Peter, about looking so good wearing glasses, he had told me, he would like to see wearing glasses sometime.
Well, Sharon, remember I told you, pretty well all men like the looks of a girl wearing glasses..
Then, Tanya, dropped me off at home, we made arrangements, to see each other again, at the school on our schedule for the eye test screening..


To day, we went to a school, to give the students a vision test, we started with the students from grade I 
I would stand beside the student to make sure, they were standing at the right distance, cover one eye, and then the other, and have them read the lines down the chart.
Tanya, looked after the movement of the students coming in and going out
If, I noticed what might be a vision problem, would ask them to wait, so Tanya, could do the second 
checkup, and if we both decided there might be a problem, we get the name, and make a notation.
After finishing, the grade 1, and grade 3 children, we passed the information to the teachers so they could inform, the parents
When we finished, it was lunch time, and we both realized that it sure was a big job, but very satisfying, knowing that the parents of children, with a vision problem will be notified.
On the way home Tanya, invited Peter and I for drinks, and a snack, on Saturday night.


I told Peter about our Saturday night invitation, he told me that's great, because he knows Tanya's husband Brandon, and likes him.
Then I told him about the vision screening, and that I was surprised that quite a few of the grade 3 students, parents, will be notified about their child's vision problem.
Yes, I have noticed that a lot more people, are wearing glasses now.


The next day, Tanya and I did the grade 5 students.
Since a few of grade 5 students wear glasses, we did not need to test them, and it did not take us very long to get the testing done.
After we were finished went for a coffee, I mentioned to Tanya, that I had noticed, that when reading the lines on the chart, I find part of the chart looking, fuzzy, and hard to read.
Well, I am not surprised, when we were at Dr. Jones office, I noticed, that you seemed to have a problem, I think, you are myopic, and need to wear glasses
I think you might be right, I know, I have trouble seeing well, when driving at night.
That was all that was said, about me most likely, having to wear glasses.
We went home, and are both looking forward to Saturday night.


We were casually dressed, and I think, looking very nice, when we arrived at Tanya and Brandon's place.
As usual, Tanya, greeted us with her big smile.
After, I was introduced to Brandon, we sat down, for a drink.
We discussed the school vision test project, and some other projects of the club, and also a lot of other things.
Just after Tanya, had handed us another drink, Peter surprised me, when he told Tanya, how beautiful she looked, wearing glasses.
Well, thank you, Peter, most women, can look fantastic wearing glasses, if they are wearing the right frame.
Peter, you have no idea, how good your wife looks, wearing glasses.
Well, I have never seen her wearing glasses, except when she is wearing sunglasses, and I don't like the dark lenses.
Yes, said Tanya, sunglasses seem to look, almost the same on everybody.
Then, when Brandon asked Peter about something, Tanya, asked the men to excuse us, she wanted to show me something, and then we will get everybody something to eat.


We left the room, and I had no idea what Tanya, wanted to show me.
When we were in the bathroom, Tanya, grabbed her make up bag, and told me, when you wear glasses, your eye make up is very important, and here is how you do it.
She then showed me how to feature my eyes, and when finished handed me, her first pair of glasses.
I put them on, and looked in the mirror, Tanya, sure knew what she was doing, I sure looked fantastic.
I looked around, and was surprised how well I could see, and when looking at far away objects, I could see them so well, as if the glasses were made for me.
Well, Tanya said, let's go and give the boys a real treat, when they see you wearing glasses to.


We went to the kitchen, and took a couple of pizza's out of the oven, and carried some plates, so we all could eat.
Are you ready for your treats, Tanya yelled, and when we heard yes, it is about time, walked into the living room.
When, Peter saw me, wearing the glasses, he looked mesmerized, then stood up, walked over to me, had another good look, and embraced, and kissed me, and said, I never seen you look so nice, you look so beautiful, I hope the glasses are yours?
When, I told them, the glasses were Tanya's first pair, he said that's to bad, I sure wish they were yours.
So, Tanya told Peter, give her a couple of weeks, and she will be wearing her own glasses, I am sure she needs to wear glasses.
Peter, asked me, if I would mind to keep wearing the glasses, and I said, if Tanya will let me.
Tanya, can Sharon, keep wearing your glasses?
Yes, she can use them, till she get's her own, so I wore the glasses all night, and when we went home,
Peter, who had too many drinks, insisted, I drive home.
I never liked driving at night, but to nite wearing the glasses, I did not have any trouble seeing everything nice and clear, now I know for sure, I need to wear glasses.




To Peter's delight, I wore the glasses all the next day.
I now like wearing them, they are so comfortable to wear, that I forget, I am wearing glasses, and I have almost perfect vision, when I wear them.
The following week, I made an appointment with Dr. Jones, secretary for a vision exam.


When, I went for my eye exam, I had been wearing Tanya's glasses for more then a week, and being so used to wearing glasses, wore the glasses to my eye exam.
The assistant, checked the glasses prescription, and the eye pressure, before I went into the examination room
When, I was asked to read the letters, I heard a lot of clicks, before the letters were clear, and easy to read.
Your prescription, has increased a little, make sure you wear your glasses full time now, and here is your prescription.
I had no idea, of the prescription, of Tanya's glasses, but noticed that now, I am, -1.25, on my right eye, and -1.00, on my left eye, so my new glasses will be a higher prescription then, the glasses, I have been wearing, what a surprise.
It did not take me long to select, a frame I really liked, and was told my glasses would be ready, 
the next day.


When, I told Peter about the eye exam, he wanted to know when I would get my new glasses
He can't wait to see my new glasses, and I told him I would be wearing my new glasses, when he comes home from work tomorrow.


On my way, to pick up my new glasses, I wondered, how strong the lenses would look, and I am now really excited, my own glasses.
When, the optician handed me my glasses and I put them on, really noticed the difference in prescription
Looking around was like looking through clear windows, everything looked sharp and well defined,
and the glasses, looked fantastic, when I looked at myself in a mirror.
I was so happy, perfect vision, good looking glasses, and a husband who likes to see me wearing glasses.
When I saw Tanya, to return her glasses, she told me my choice of frame could not have been better,
and after looking at my prescription, and then trying my glasses, said you sure needed to wear glasses.


Peter, when he came home, and saw me wearing my new glasses, gave me a big hug, Susan, I love my glasses wearing wife, you look so beautiful.
A husband who loves your glasses, and loving your glasses wearing look, made me feel a very lucky girl, about having to wear glasses, and being able to see perfect.
I am so glad, I joined the ladies club, and met Tanya, that is where it all started, to make me a happy glasses wearing girl.
