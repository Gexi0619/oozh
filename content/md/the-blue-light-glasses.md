The blue light glasses


We married, a short time ago, my husband Randy, and I, Sarah, are very fortunate, we had saved, enough money to buy a house,.
We both like our, nice house in the suburbs, on a nice quiet street


Before I was married, I worked, as an office manager, for a large company.
I liked my work, but now, I am staying home, because my husband, does not like me to work, he wants his wife, to make a home for him, and hopefully raise a family..
I knew that, before I got married, and he makes enough money, so we plan, to start a family, that should keep me busy.


I have met, all our neighbour ladies,, we visit each other occasionally, for a coffee.
I miss my work, I like to be busy, and noticed, I can make some extra money, working on line, so I applied, and now work from home, in one of our spare rooms.


I spend many hours, working on the computer, and lately I have had, more headaches, I think, from starring at the computer monitor to long. 


Talking with my neighbour, she mentioned, that a lot of people, now wear blue light glasses, working on their computers, they might solve your problem. 
Well, that might be, the thing I need, so I will order a pair.


In today’s mail, I received my blue light glasses
I never, before, had anything to do with glasses, and, being a woman, I wanted to know, how I would look, wearing the glasses, 
When, I put the plastic frame, glasses on, and looked at my self, was surprised how glasses, can change your look, I think, I might, like, that look.
Now, let’s go to work, and see, if wearing the glasses does the trick.


After, wearing the blue light, glasses for about a couple of weeks, I still had my daily headaches.
To night, we are invited to a special dinner, and while driving there, with my husband, I noticed, there are a lot of halos, around all the lights, I mentioned it to Randy,
I cannot see any halos, where are they?


Seating, at our table for dinner, was an optometrist, and his glasses wearing, wife Betty, she sat beside me, and when talking to her,, I mentioned, I had bought, some blue light glasses.
Well, some people swear by them, but most computer vision problem, are only solved, when people, start to wear, proper prescription glasses, that, was the end of the conversation, because we had to be quiet.


Like Betty, had told me, the blue light glasses, did not solve my problem,
I still, had a headache, working the computer.
I think, I better, have an eye exam.


To day, I told my husband, about my headaches, and what Betty had told me.
He really surprised me, when he told me, to go and see Jim, Betty’s husband for an eye exam, he will look after you.
I made an appointment, for an eye exam.


Before, the eye exam, I had very mixed feelings, how am I going to look wearing glasses, and will Randy, like looking at me, wearing glasses?
I know, I will look different wearing glasses, and what is it like to wear glasses?
With all those question,s on my mind, I went to see Sadie, a glasses wearing neighbour.


Sadie told me, not to worry about my looks, I know, you will look fantastic, wearing glasses, and they are easy to wear, 
I like wearing glasses, I have three pair, so I can vary my look.
Wait for a second, I will get my glasses, and I will show you. 
When she came back, she even brought a hand mirror, and she let me try her glasses, and after, I had a good look at my self, I now know, I can look good wearing glasses.
I am ready for my eye exam.
When, Jim was finished with my eye exam, told me, my eyes were healthy, but that I am myopic, and have some astigmatism, and I should, wear my glasses full time.
When, I mentioned contact lenses, he suggested, to see the optician, with my prescription, and she would fit the lenses.


Poking myself in the eye, inserting the lens, and trying to get the lens out, was more of a problem, then I had expected.
I decided, against contact lenses, and started to look, for a nice frame.
The optician, assisted me, finding some very nice looking frames, and I decided, to buy, two pair of glasses..


When, my glasses were ready, and I put them on, I liked my new, glasses wearing look, and I am sure, my husband, will like my new look.
When looking around, I could not believe, the improvement in my vision,
everything, I looked at, was so nice and clear, I loved it.


That night, when my husband came home, looked at me, then, walked over to me, and kissed me, and told me, I looked fantastic, wearing glasses.
He and I had a fantastic night,


Working, wearing the prescription glasses, sure made a big difference.


About two months, after, I had started to wear glasses, I discovered, I was pregnant.
During my pregnancy, I also, noticed a big change, in my vision.
When, I went to see, Jim, the optometrist, he checked my vision, and I had a big increase, in my prescription.
The pregnancy, went well, and we became the proud parents, of a beautiful baby girl. 
After the birth, my vision did not change, till, I got pregnant again, and had another big increase, in my prescription, to -4.50
After the birth of my third child, my prescription read, - 5.50.
Randy, and I agreed, three children, will be our family.
Hoping, my prescription, would not increase any more, I purchased some new glasses, for my wardrobe, I love wearing glasses, and my husband likes, how I look, wearing glasses.


Emily, our oldest girl, is ready for school this fall, and I made sure, all three girls had an eye exam, and all three at present, have 20/20 vision.


We like, to take the children, camping during the summer.
This past summer, I noticed, that when, I pointed, at something, interesting, far away,,the girls mentioned to me, that they could not see, what ever, I had pointed out to them. 
I am now, concerned, about their eye sight, might they be myopic like me?.


When, after the summer, we had our yearly eye exams.
Emily, who was to start grade 3 , was prescribed glasses, for myopia,.
Sadie, who, is going into grade 2, is also myopic, now we have, two glasses wearing girls, I am not really surprised. 
I love, their glasses wearing look, they look so cute, and young lady like., wearing their glasses.


Now I am wondering, if our son, Brett, the youngest member of our family,
will be myopic to.


When, it was time, for our yearly eye exams, the girls were all excited, they would like to get new glasses.
Both girls, had a noticeable increase, in their prescription, but were more excited, about getting new frames, and it took a while to find the right ones , they liked.
Brett, does not need to wear glasses, and I think, he feels left out, but that was not, for to long, because at the next eye exam, he was prescribed glasses, and he likes his new look, and is happy now, he does not feel left out.


To night Sadie, asked my husband, why he is not wearing glasses, so everybody in the family wears, glasses.
You would like to see me wear glasses?
Both girls said, yes.
Brett, can you hand me my brief case, please.
Brett , gave Randy his brief case, and he opened it, and pulled out, a glasses case,
The girls looked at him, when he slowly, put on his glasses.
Daddy you look so nice, wearing glasses, you should wear, your glasses all the time. 
Well, to morrow, I see, Dr. Jim, and he will tell me, what I should do .
I hope, he will tell you, the same, as he has been telling us, you have to wear your glasses, all day.
It all happened, after,.......... I purchased my blue light glasses.
