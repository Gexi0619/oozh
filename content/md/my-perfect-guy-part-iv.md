Hello everyone! So sorry I took so long, here's part four. I would like to thank soundmanpt, nic, lorelai.grace82 for your nice comments on my last post, I love your stories as well!! 

This one is dedicated to my friend "glassesforeveryone" thank you for your kind words.

I never thought of how exiting and scary it is to have such bad vision, it would have been a good idea to do the GOC before this procedure because I’m not used to wearing glasses and I keep taking them off and as soon as I do I remember now I have no choice. 

Now that I’m home, I can see my face on the mirror… Funny thing I never did this on Mexico City, I guess I was just too afraid I wouldn’t like it anymore. My eyes look so tiny, my glasses look to be very thick even when they were the most expensive and the thinnest ones they could make, and if I remove them my face becomes an instant featureless spot. I absolutely distinguish myself, but I can’t see any feature of my face until I’m literally touching the mirror with my nose. 

I just keep discovering what wearing glasses is like, there are just so many things that are so different now. A thing that never crossed my mind is how heavy they are and how I constantly find myself pushing them up my nose. Taking baths is quite interesting now, because if I leave them on, they get wet and the drops dry on the lenses and then they are dirty… but if I take them off I can’t see the shampoo bottle in front of me. 

It’s time to think of a good explanation to tell my friends and family why the hell I’m so nearsighted if I had perfect vision, and I’m just gonna tell them I used to wear contacts all the time and now I can’t. I know some won’t believe me, but I don’t think people actually have the GOC or the lens implants on their minds. 

—————————————————————————————————

Today I had a rough morning, I’ve been living in this apartment for a year now and Mike practically lived here with me, and I thought he had taken everything out, but I found a sweater he looked gorgeous with and a few pictures of us together. I truly love him, but he is an asshole so I’m deciding tonight I’m going out. I call Tony, a good friend of mine and he tells me they already have reservations and I could join, so it’s set. 

Doing your make up while wearing glasses is extra hard, but I manage to do it fine (Thank you Megan Moose from youtube), I’m wearing a black leather jacket, black jeans and high heels to lift up my self-esteem and my butt 

I can’t believe how hard it is to navigate in the dark when your glasses are over -25, lights are awful, darkness is awful, everything looks hazy but I finally see Tony and I’m so relieved. 

“Tony!! How happy I am to find you” I said loudly and exited

“Do I know you?” Said Tony with a weird look on his face

“Really? It’s me… NICKY!” I replied as I pull up my glasses for him to see my face

“OMG Nicole, what the fuck are those coke bottles?” he said 

“Don’t be such a douche they suit her” Said one of his female friends

“Thank you” I smiled politely at the girl “I’ve been wearing contacts for quite a while now and I just can’t stand them anymore” I said

“Poor you, being so pretty ands so blind” Said Tonys sister

I don’t really know how to react, I try to be as Mike was when I said anything about his glasses… But I don’t hate them, I do enjoy wearing them, plus I’m enjoying this attention!

“I know, such a shame right?” I said trying to act upset
 
Being in a dark place surrounded by people, objects, tables, chairs, is extra hard when your vision is poor, thank God Tony holds my arm. I don’t think he realizes this but right now he is guiding me, I’m just focusing on grabbing him back and I hold my glasses with my left hand because I feel they’re gonna fall and I get so anxious!! I do have my “souvenir” pair with me, but I can’t see with that pair either, they’re only -20 both eyes. 

Finally we get to our table and as soon as I can I ask the waiter to bring me a tequila shot and a dry martini, maybe it isn’t the best idea when you go out to mix those drinks, but tonight I’ll do whatever I like! Tony has a beer instead and Tonys friends have vodka I guess they wanna get wasted too because 2 bottles seems a lot for 2 girls and 3 guys. 

I’m really enjoying everything tonight! I’ve had 3 martinis so far because we are dancing and singing, and just when I was thinking nothing could ruin this night for me I see him… Yes that tall, handsome guy grabbing another girls hand is Mike. A rush of emotions run through me, I’m happy to see him, I’m mad at him for leaving, I’m disappointed he already has someone else and my heart breaks when she kisses him. That’s it, I need to go home, I’m not ready for this and I can’t stand it anymore…

“Tony, I’m sorry I have to go” I said 

“WHY? IS EVERYTHING OK?” Tony screams at me

“Yes, I just have to  go” I said as I give him money “Here, drinks on me” 

I’m so mad I don’t even wait for Tony, I just grab my purse and head to the exit. I’ll take a Uber, so I’m walking down the street to the spot the app marked for me and I hear Mikes voice.

“NICOLE!!!, NICOLE!!!!” said a very angry man

“Just walk nikki, don’t look back” I say to myself 

“NICOLE I’M TALKING TO YOU” said Mike 

And I feel his big hands puling my right arm to turn me towards him

“What the fuck is this? Do you still think this is funny?!” Said Mike

“What do you mean Michael? Let me fucking go!” I said as I pushed him back

“That contact lenses thing you told me is dumb, you need to understand you don’t need this and you should be grateful” He said as he took my glasses off of me

“NO MIKE, WAIT!!! I do need them, please give them to me” I begged him 

“You don’t Nicole, and you are being stupid you know? just take those damn contacts out and throw them, you’re not getting these back” said Mike

“No Mike, I’m not wearing contacts, please give them to me” I said, but I’m not sure he is there anymore “MICHAEL!!! PLEASE MIKE! MICHAEL!!” I keep screaming but he is gone

What the F am I going to do now? I can’t see anything, everything is dark, this isn’t a familiar place for me. I’m screwed, I’m so very screwed. I stand next to a street lamp and I’m crying so hard. How am I here? How can Mike be such an idiot? I manage to call Tony and he comes running to get me. 

“What happened? are you ok?” Said Tony

I hug him and I cry hard

“Did someone rape you? Are you hurting? Where are your glasses?” Asked Tony very worried

“Mike took them, he was at the club too and he followed me” I said trying to compose myself

“That bastard, what a minute” Tony said placing me on the street lamp once again

WTF is wrong with my ex and my friend? They both left me blind and alone! But now I know what Tony is doing, as I hear people screaming there are two guys fighting and the security guys kick them out 

“Give me my glasses you asshole” Said Mike

“Give Nicole hers first” replied Tony

“What?! She doesn’t need them!! haven’t she told you she is wearing contacts?” said Mike

“I don’t care what’s going on, just give me her glasses and you’ll have yours back” said Tony

Right now I can’t figure out what they’re doing, but I suddenly feel Tonys hand placing my glasses on my hand. 

“Here Nikki, you’re the one deciding Mikes faith, crush them if you want to, or snap them in half” Said Tony

“We had a deal, give them to me Nicole!” Mike demands

“You had a deal with Tony, not with me. And I’ll give them to you but I want to talk to you, privately NOW” I said

“Ok ok, let’s go to my place then, but please give them to me” Mike begged

“No, let’s go to my place and I’ll give them to you there. You’re not leaving me like this ever again.” I said

Tony is looking at me weird and he doesn’t believe I wanna talk to Mike after all the things he has done, but I do want to talk to him.

Mike tries to reach my hand for me to guide him but instead I pull apart and tell him to follow my voice. I can see how bad he is squinting but right now I’m so mad I can’t think beyond. 

This is the most quiet car drive I’ve been in. It is very uncomfortable for both of us, I can see Mike is having a hard time, when you are this myopic traffic lights are awful at night, and I know I’m gonna sound like I’m a horrible girl, but this was very necessary for me. 

“Listen to me Mike, you are coming to my house one more time. If you hurt me in any way, I’ll call the cops on you” I said

“I won’t Nikki, I really think we should talk too” he said as he came in

Ok, take a sit, I’ll make us coffee.


Mike sits on the couch still squinting hard, I stand almost next to him and he is not even aware. “Ok, here you go Mike” I say as I place his glasses on the coffee table and he fumbles to grab them. I’m feeling bad now, Mike has always been polite to me, the guy at the club and the guy that broke up with me is not the same guy I fell in love with.

“Here, no sugar, no cream, as always” I said handing him a mug

“Thanks Niks, uhmm listen I’d me more comfortable if I could talk to the Nikki I know, but I’ll respect your GOC decision” said Mike

“This is the Nikki you know Michael, I’m not doing GOC. This is me now. I had a procedure and this is Nicole Way.” I replied 
 
“What? You did What?!!” said Mike upset “Nicole I broke up with you because of this, you’ll regret this for the rest of your life!! Don’t you understand? being like this isn’t cool, being so dependent on something so fragile, not being able to see your face without glasses… What have you done Nikki?!” Said Mike about to burst into tears

“I wanted this Mike, you didn’t listen. I did this because of me, not because of you, I loved you and yes your glasses were a big part of my life, but couldn’t you think that I would be fine? You are fine and you are naturally myopic” I said trying to be calmed

“Nikki I broke up with you to avoid this… I love you to death but I don’t want you harming yourself because of me” said Mike

“Why do you think I did it because of you? I did it for myself! And you don’t get to say you love me, you left me” I replied

“Yes, I did. But I thought you were gonna be better. This has been really hard for me Nicole, I didn’t want you going through all I’ve been, I wanted you to be able to see the face of the guy you love as soon as you wake up, and not having to reach for your glasses as I had to do it to be able to see your face” Said Mike crying

“Well the guy I love left me, so I don’t get to see his face anymore anyway. You should have talked to me, you could have been there for me, you could have done so much better… This is who I am Mike, I finally feel like myself and even if I lost my eyesight without glasses, I wouldn’t change this” I said

As soon as I’m done speaking Mike stands up and comes to me to hug me

“I’m sorry babe, please forgive me, I’m so sorry, please Nikki believe me I’m sorry, I’m not an asshole, I just want you to be happy” said Mike crying on my lap

“You are an asshole Mike, you broke my heart. You had no reason to leave the way you did, and I hate myself for loving you so much even after that” I said as I gabbed his hair

To be continue…
