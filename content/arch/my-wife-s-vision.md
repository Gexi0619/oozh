My wife's glasses 

My wife had perfect eyesight at the age of 12.
But returning to school after the summer break at the age of 13 she could not see the black board.(called white board now)
She was taken for her first eye test and was prescribed glasses and told to wear them full time,,she does not know the prescription but can remember the feeling that the pavement seemed to be jumping up at her for the first week.. From that first day she never went outside without them. Putting  them on as soon as she woke and only removing them at bed time.

Each year there was a small increase.

The year she started university she had small astigmation correction added
.
We met just after she left university,I suggested she should have an eye test and I would buy her a new pair ,as being a student for 4 years she had not been able to afford new glasses.
Her prescription was now R -2.00 -1.25 110  L -175 -1.00  80

3 years later we decided to get married. As she had never been out without glasses on for the last 12 years  and very few people had seen her bare eyed,I arrange for a eye test,we were both surprised at the result her prescription,it had jumped to  R -3.00 -175 115  L-2.00 85.it was a new optician that we went to and they had to rush the Order as there was some mixup and the glasses never fitted well. As You may have suspected she wore glasses for our wedding.
Without telling her I also bought her a pair of pink NHS glasses with a pink frames (I will leave the rest to your amagination)

6 months later I found  a private optician,when we showed him my wife's prescription and where it came from he insisted on doing a new test 
2 days later at the age of 25 my wife left his shop wearing her first pair of round top bifocals.
Her prescription was R -3.25 -150 120 Add 0.50    L -175  -1.00  85 Add 0.50

The next year the only change was the Add increased to 1.00 and D28 flat top bifocals 
It was that year that she was fitted with her first BTE hearing aid.

Very little happened for the next 4 years.

For her 30th birthday she wanted new glasses as a present,it was then that things started to change,her distance prescription started to get lower and her Add increased 
 Her prescription was then R-2.50 1.50 125  Add 2.00 L -1.25 85  Add 2.00
Because of her work the eye doctor suggested she try executive trifocals as she now wore hearing aids in both ears he felt varifocals  would not be good because of her balance 

Things slowly change over the next few years 

When she reached 40 things took another Major changed 
R -1.50 -1.25 125  Add 2.75 prism out 1 
L.- 1.25 -1.00 85   Add  2.75 prism out 1 
D28 flat top bifocals and a separate pair of reading glasses 
Technology had not moved on very much, so her new hearing aids were now much larger as her hearing had deteriorated .  

At the age of 50 her prescription was 
R-1.25  -1.00 130  Add 3.00 prism out 2.50 
L -1.25. -0.75.  85. Add 3.00 prism out 2.50 
Flat top D28 bifocals and seperate reading glasses + 3.00 same astigmatism correction and 2.75 prism
The new hearing aids are now more powerful but much smaller.

5 year later 
R-1.00 -1.00 130 Add 3.25 prism out 3.00
L.-1.00 -0.75 90  Add 3.25  prism out 3.00

Last year 
R-0.25. -1.00 130  Add 3.50. Prism out 3
L  0.25  -0.50   90  Add 3.50. Prism out 3

Flat top D35 bought from Selectspecs online   and 2 separate reading glasses  from Zenni 
+3.50 and 4 25 prism
and +4.50 and 5 out prism.for sowing
I expect when she has her next test her prescription will be all plus as when she is cooking she wears her +3.50 reading glasses and often forgets to change back to her bifocals 

My wife's first pair of glasses were pink NHS plastic frames as were my school sweethearts.
After I bought her a pair of pink NHS glasses to take away with us for our honeymoon. Since then she has always had a pair of NHS frames as a second pair.
Those frames are now called retro so she now wears a pink pair as her main glasses and a clear pair for middle distance and a blue pair for reading.
I have kept most of her prescription so I was able to.look back over time to write this true story and relive happy memory's.
