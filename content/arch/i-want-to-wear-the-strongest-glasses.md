I want to wear the strongest glasses !


When I was 4 years old, at our annual eye exam, I was prescribed to wear glasses.
I am sure, my mother was not surprised, because, she has worn glasses all her life
My dad and my older brother, do not wear glasses.
My mother is myopic, and wears – 16.00 glasses,.
I understand myopia runs in her family, her two sisters are wearing glasses, with lenses, that look even stronger than my mother’s glasses,
At our last family picnic, I noticed that almost all my nieces and nephews are wearing glasses.
I also, noticed that all the girls are wearing glasses, but not all the boys, I wonder why?




I like the look of glasses wearing girls, because it features their eyes, and their frames, usually blends so nicely, with the colour of their hair, 
When wearing glasses, your eyes are framed like a picture, so everybody can notice them.


I am now going into grade 4, and my glasses prescription at my last exam, went up to – 4.00.


I have two close girl friends, we became friends in grade 1, but Sadie, and Amber do not wear glasses.
Sadie, told me she likes the looks of glasses, but does not need to wear them
Amber, wonders, if she might have to wear glasses, because her mother and older sister wear glasses, she told us she can see just fine, but she will find out, because she is due for an eye exam, next week.


Amber had her eye exam, but does not need to wear glasses., she was told perhaps next year.


Sadie, likes the looks of glasses, and would like to wear glasses.


After my last eye exam, when my prescription went up again, to the – 5.00 range, Sadie went with me, to help me, find a nice new frame.
Sadie found some frames that she loves, and was walking around, wearing a frame
that looked really nice on her.
It took us a while, but I like the frame, that we finally selected for me..


A few days later, Sadie came over to my place, and told me, she wants to wear glasses.
I know you do, and you will look very nice wearing glasses, but not to long ago you had an eye exam, and was told you do not have to wear glasses.
I was reading, that you can induce myopia, wearing glasses with myopic lenses., and I was thinking, you might have a pair of old glasses, that you are not wearing anymore, that I can borrow.
Yes, I do, here they are, and I opened my dresser drawer.
Can I try them?
Sure, here, try this pair, I don’t know or the frame is large enough.
No, they are too tight.
Here try this pair, they have a larger frame, I wore those glasses, a couple of years ago.
They sure fit my face a lot better, but my vision is not very good.
I think, you will have to keep wearing them, and your eyes and brain, will get used to wearing the glasses.
The glasses, sure look nice on you.
Thank you, I will have a look in the mirror.
Yes, I sure like the looks of these glasses, can I have them.
Yes, give the glasses a try..
That was the day, that Sadie started to wear glasses.


Sadie, is so happy, now she is wearing glasses., her vision is not perfect, but the feel of the frame on her nose, is so comfortable, and she loves the way she looks wearing the glasses, and she is is going to keep on wearing the glasses all she can..


The following Monday, Sadie, even wore the glasses going to school, and I was surprised, when she told me, she can now, see almost perfect wearing the glasses.
Of course, a lot of the girls asked her about the glasses, and wanted to try them, Sadie loved all the attention, most of all, when they told her, you must be blind, wearing glasses this strong.
The only time, Sadie did not wear her glasses, when she was at home with her parents.


A couple of months later, Sadie asked me for a pair of glasses, with a stronger prescription.
I gave Sadie the – 4.00 glasses, that I wore last year.
After Sadie put the glasses on, said, I can see almost perfect, I love it.


Sadie, grew, and so did her myopia, she now realizes, she will have to start wearing her glasses, all the time, to see properly.
Being so used to wearing the glasses at school, and wearing the glasses walking home, that one day,, she forgot to take her glasses off, when entering the house.


Her mother, noticed Sadie wearing the glasses, and asked her where she got the glasses.
I found these glasses the other day, and when I tried them, and wore them to school, found it much easier to read, what was on the blackboard, so I wear the glasses, at school, and today, I forgot to take them off.


Let me have a good look at you, well, I must say, you look very nice wearing glasses,.
How do you like wearing the glasses?
I like wearing the glasses, they are very comfortable, and I like the way I look wearing them.
Well, I think, we better arrange for an eye exam for you, so you will be wearing, proper prescribed glasses, you can wear the glasses, you are wearing now, for the time being until your eye exam.
Thank goodness, now I can wear the glasses all the time, and see properly.


I wore the glasses, going to the exam, because we went to a different doctor, who did not know my vision history.
I would love to have my glasses prescription, as high , or even higher then Jennifer, I love the looks of the lenses, in high prescription glasses., showing rings, and depth.


I was all excited going for my eye exam, would the doctor give me an increase in my prescription? I would love that.
The exam went well, an adjustment for my astigmatism, and a large increase in my prescription, to -5.50, I love that, now my glasses are stronger then Jennifer’s.
The doctor told me, to expect further increases, as I am still growing fast,
that sounded like music to my ears.


Now, I am wearing glasses, with a proper prescription, which show some depth and rings, I am so happy with my new glasses.


When I told Jennifer, that my glasses prescription now is -5.50, she could not believe it.
I let her try my glasses, and she likes them, and she noticed the difference in the prescription..
All three of us are in high school now, and during the summer, when Amber had her eye exam, she was prescribed to wear glasses.
She looks great wearing glasses ,and is happy with them.
Sadie and I had our eye exams, and after growing quit a bit, both of us had a diopter increase in our prescription.


I think, Sadie would like nothing better, than having the highest prescription,
I wonder if she will.


Sadie, wants to have the highest prescription, and at her last eye exam, talked her mother into, letting her order her glasses on line, because she loves one particular frame.
Her mother did not object, so Sadie ordered 2 pairs of the glasses, each with one diopter increase over her prescription.
She now wears a pair of -6.50 glasses, and her next pair is – 7.50.


It did not take Sadie very long, to get used to wear the -7.50 glasses.
Jennifer noticed, that Sadie’s glasses lenses looked stronger, and asked her about it, so Sadie told her what she had done.
Jennifer tried the glasses, and could not see to well.
Sadie, what are you trying to do?
I want to wear, glasses with at least a -15.00, prescription, and want to make sure I 
am up that high, before my early twenties, when my eyes settle, and it becomes more difficult to induce more myopia. 


Jennifer, not to be outdone, is now wearing over correction glasses.


Both girls, since they started to wearing stronger glasses, are asked a lot of for dates, and love all the attention.


When all three, graduated from high school, Amber wore – 3.00 glasses, Sadie, was up to -12.00 , and my prescription was -11.00.


A couple of years later, Sadie’s prescription was up to – 16.00, and she looks fantastic, wearing the stronger lenses, and she is so happy, with her new looks, my prescription, is up to -15.00 now


Sadie, has a steady boyfriend, who off course, wears glasses, and likes wearing them.
He also does, glasses over contacts, and he loves it, when Sadie saw him for the first time doing it, decided she wants to do it to.


A few weeks later, Sadie and Tim, are doing g.o.c. and are wearing – 25.00 glasses, and she loves it, her boyfriend Tim, wears the same prescription.


Sitting on the sofa, looking at each other wearing the strong glasses, Tim said, Sadie looking at you, wearing those beautiful strong glasses, sure turns me on, 
So ! why don’t you do something about it, and he did.


I am going to get married to Tim, because I am pregnant, and want to keep doing, g.o. c. as much as possible, so we can have more fun. and wear the strongest glasses ,possible !!!

To all our readers, Happy Holidays, and a Happy, Healthy New Year, and please stay safe. Nic
