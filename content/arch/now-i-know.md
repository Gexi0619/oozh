Now I know.!


Me, Amy and my husband Jim, are very proud of our family, of two healthy children., Logan who is 6 years old and will be going into grade one, and Megan, who is four.
We live in a nice house, not to far from the school and a beautiful playground.
Yesterday, when Jim was playing baseball with Logan, and trying to teach him, to hit the ball, Logan seems unable to see the ball coming at the right time, so Jim put a big stick in the ground and when he puts the ball on top of it, Logan does much better hitting the ball, and they had a good time.


The house next door, that was for sale, is sold and we wonder who our new neighbors are going to be.
About a week before school is starting, we noticed a moving truck, when our new neighbors moved in.
I baked a nice cake, and later in the day, went over with the cake to welcome our new neighbors.
I was invited in and met Nancy, and her husband Peter, and their three children, Katie, who is eight, Kevin who is six, and Ashley who is four years old.
What really surprised me that the whole family was wearing glasses. even the children except the youngest one..
Nancy, is a very good looking and pleasant person, and I think would like to be friends with her.


Last night, Jim and I had our weekly night out, the baby sitter is looking after our children to night.
On the way to the movies, I noticed a lot of halos around the lights, and wondered why.
During the movie we took seats in the middle of the theater so I could enjoy the movie.
We had a great night out, and on returning home, were greeted by the baby sitter who had put both our children to bed. 


School has started, and Logan told me he likes his teacher, and sits in front of the classroom, so he can see everything, and told me Kevin from next door, is also in his class, then he asked me why Kevin is wearing glasses all the time, so I told Logan, that Kevin, most likely cannot see things as well as you can, and needs to wear his glasses.
Mommy, I think I like to wear glasses, they look so nice.
Well Logan, perhaps you will someday.


To day, Nancy, and her children came over for a visit.
Kevin went with Logan to his room, and the younger girls were playing together.
After some small talk, I told Nancy about Kevin remarking about Peter wearing glasses.
Well peter is myopic, he has trouble seeing things far away, and he started to wear glasses about a month ago, being nearsighted runs in our family, both my husband, Katie and I are all nearsighted
Well I don't know anything about glasses, my vision is perfect.
Amy, nobody knows if their vision is prefect, only an eye exam will tell for sure, every person should have a regular eye exam, most of all young children, there is no other way to tell if they can see properly.
I never knew that.
A little while later, Kevin and Logan, who was wearing Kevin's glasses came into the room, and Logan asked me to buy him some glasses just like Kevin's, because he can see everything so much better when wearing Kevin's glasses.
I was really surprised when I heard that, well Amy. said it sounds like Logan might need to wear glasses, 
I can't believe it, how will I know for sure?
Well, Amy all you have to do is get him an eye exam, then you will know.


That night at our evening meal, Logan told my husband about the glasses, and how much better he could see wearing the glasses.
Jim was just as surprised as I was, when I heard Logan say that. 
Nancy suggested I should arrange for an eye exam, for both our children.
Well Nancy most likely is right, they all wear glasses, so she knows more about that, then we do, you better arrange for an eye exam.


I walked with my children, into the optical store, and shortly after, we were in the examination room.
The doctor was very informative, and told me about every procedure she was doing.
What surprised me most, was when she mentioned how she can detect certain diseases when looking into the eyes.
Megan's eyes are healthy, but Logan is myopic, and needs to wear glasses.
Logan was all excited and because there was a 2 for 1 sale, he now has 2 pairs of glasses.
We had no problem getting Logan to wear his glasses, he loves them.
After what the doctor had told me, made me wonder and I decided, I better have an eye exam.


Nancy went with me when I went to have my eye exam, to look after Megan.
What a surprise, when I had my exam, and was told I needed to wear glasses, I am myopic, I can't believe it, here I always thought my vision was perfect, now I know.
Nancy was a big help when I was finding a nice frame that I liked, and I had no idea, what Jim's reaction would be, seeing me wearing glasses, he did not even know I went for an eye exam.


I was told my glasses would be ready, in a couple of hours, so Nancy, Megan and I went for a bite to eat.
Nancy congratulated me on how fantastic I looked wearing glasses frame, your husband will love your new look, well I certainly hopes he does, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised I looked this good.
It was not long and it was time to pick up my glasses, I had mixed feelings, about wearing glasses, are they really going to improve my vision?
The optician handed me my glasses, and I slowly put them on, and first thing I did, was look in the mirror on the desk.
The optician, then adjusted the frame, and I was surprised how comfortable the glasses felt.
When I looked around, could not believe the improvement in my vision.
When we were driving home, I took the glasses off, and put them back on, and I am surprised wearing glasses can make that much difference, now I know, why Logan likes wearing his glasses, he now can see properly.


My biggest surprise was when Jim came home, and saw me wearing glasses.
I will never forget his reaction, he was speechless, for a while, before he said Amy, you look beautiful
wearing glasses, I love your new look.
After I told him everything, and about my improved vision, said I am glad Nancy and her husband moved in next door, I will have to thank her for all her help.
That night we went to bed early!!!!!!
Now I know how important eye exams are, how my husband likes to see me wear glasses,
and how happy Logan is wearing glasses,
The biggest surprise is that my husband is going for an eye exam, because he likes the looks of glasses.
Now I know a lot more then I did a short while ago
                     NOW I KNOW!
