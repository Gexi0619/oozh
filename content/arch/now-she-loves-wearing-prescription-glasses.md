Now, she loves, wearing prescription glasses.


When you are 8 years old, it seems, some things you see, and do, you like very much.,
and also can, make a lasting impression.
That happened, when new people, moved in next door.
While, I stood watching, the truck being unloaded, a car drove up.
A lady, and a couple of girls, came out of the car.
What I noticed right away, that all three were wearing glasses.
I had never seen, anybody in our family, wearing glasses, and then to see three people in a family wear glasses, really surprised me.
A girl, about my age, was trying to hang on to her dog, but the dog ran away.
Of course, the girl was very upset.
Since, I am familiar, with all the drive ways and alleys in the neighborhood, noticed the dog 
running, into a dead end lane way.
I ran toward where the dog was, and had no trouble getting a hold of his leash, and walked him back,
to where the girl was.
She was all smiles, when, I handed her the leash.
Thank you, you are welcome, it was no problem, I knew your dog ran into a dead end ally.
My name is Kevin, I live next door.
While I talked to her, I could not stop looking at her glasses, I noticed, that when she moved her head,
sideways, and I looked through the edge of the lenses, everything in the distance, looked smaller, and farther away, I really liked that, and I wondered why.
That was the day, I made up my mind, that, if I had to wear glasses, I would like the lenses, to be just like that.


About a year later, when walking, to school, I noticed, that Megan, the girl next door, was wearing new glasses.
I told her, how nice she looked wearing her new glasses, she told me, her new glasses were stronger now, and her old ones, were no good anymore.
So I asked her, what are you going to do, with your old glasses?
I don t know, most likely throw them away.
So, I hesitantly asked, can I have them?
Well, I will have to check with my mother, to see, if I can get rid of them, I will let you know.
A few days later, on the way to school, Megan, handed me her old glasses.
Thank you, and I put the glasses in my back pack.


After school, I could not get home fast enough.
I ran up to my room, got the glasses case, out of my back pack , opened the case, and there were the glasses.
I looked at the glasses, and slowly put them on., and walked over to the mirror on my dresser, and looked at myself, I liked the way I looked wearing the glasses.
I was very surprised, that I could see reasonably well, when wearing the glasses, and I noticed, how everything, further away looked a little smaller.
When I took the glasses off, and held them away from my face, noticed when looking trough the lenses, everything looked smaller and farther away, fantastic.
I started to wear the glasses, every chance I had, and making sure nobody would see me wear them.
Surprisingly, it did not take me very long, to see everything nice and clear, when wearing the glasses, 
I loved it.


My sister Melanie, is friends, with the older girl, next door.
At dinner, last night, she told us that Kathie, was wearing new glasses now, and how nice she looked.
Kathie, told me, that the whole family, has an eye exam, every year, why have we never had an eye exam?
My father looked at my mother, with a questioning look.
Well, my mother said, I never had an eye exam, and I am sure, that only people, who cannot see well have an eye exam.
I will, check into the need for eye exams, and let you know, what I find out.


The next day, while we were at school, my mother went next door, to talk to Kathie s mother.
She explained to my mother, that most people, do not know, that their vision is not perfect, until they have an eye exam.
That is how we found out, our vision is not perfect, so we all wear glasses.
Everyone, in our family, has a yearly eye exam.


When we came home from school, my mother told us, she had made appointments, for our eye exams.
My sister said, I am glad to hear that, I sure like to find, out how they examine eyes.
I did not say anything, I hope, I will be told, I have to wear glasses, I love glasses.


When, my sister and I went for our eye exam, I asked her, if she would be upset, if she needed to wear glasses.
I don t know, some girls, look very nice wearing glasses, perhaps, what about you?
I would not mind having to wear glasses.
Melanie, had her exam first, and when she came out of the examination room, said, I don t have to wear glasses
I had my exam, and when the optometrist told me, I needed to wear glasses, I smiled, great.
I was fitted with glasses, and the glasses would be ready to morrow, after school.
My parents, could not believe, that I needed to wear glasses.
The next day, at school, I told everybody, to morrow, you will see me wearing glasses.


When the optician, handed me my glasses, and I put them on, was surprised how well, I could see.
Looking at myself, in the mirror, noticed, the lenses, were the kind I liked.
I was happy, that I looked this good wearing glasses.
Looking at my prescription, I read, O.D. -0.75, O.S.-1.00, and some other figures.
The next day, at school, I proudly wore my glasses, nasty comments, did not bother me, I had my wish,
wearing glasses, with myopic lenses.


Now we all have yearly eye exams, and my prescription went up, about Â½ diopter each time.
By the time, I was in my last year of high school, my prescription read, right eye 4.00, left eye -4.25,
and some astigmatism.
I am very happy, with my new look, the lenses show some rings and some depth, and I love wearing glasses.


I am finished, studying, and now, have a good job.
I enjoy my work, and my supervisors seem to be happy, with my performance.
Enjoying life, I like to think about my future, settling down, and having a family.
I look, at every girl who wears glasses, and when I go for a date, the girl has to wear glasses.
There are lots of pretty glasses wearing girls, but I have not been able, to find the right one.


A beautiful weekend is forecast.
Friday night, after work, I go home, pick up my camping gear, and off to the beach.
No problem, getting a camping spot, pitched my tent, and off to the little resort town, for some supplies.
I notice, a larger number, than I had expected, young people, so I can have fun girl watching, this weekend.
I went for a drink, so I would have more time, to look around.


The next day, I went to the beach, had a swim, and after that, I soaked up some sun.
After a while, I got hungry, and decided to go and buy some lunch.
Then I spotted a couple of girls, with, hour glass figures.
I was so busy looking, at those girls, that I did not notice a girl, lying, all stretched out, sunbathing.
I tripped over her legs, and fell on my face.
Well, are you falling for me?
Sorry, I did not watch where I was going.
I retrieved my glasses, that had fallen off, and looked at the girl.
Well, do you see, what you like?
Yes, I do, by the way, my name is Kevin, what is yours?
I am Ashley.
May I make up for my clumsiness, and buy you, your lunch?
Well, first, let me have a good look at you, hmmm, yes, that would be nice.
Ashley stood up, wow!, what a body.
She shook her head a little, and I noticed, that she also, had a beautiful head of hair.
She was wearing very stylish sunglasses, a real beauty.


When we were seated, and enjoying our lunch, she was still wearing her sunglasses.
I asked her, if they were prescription sunglasses.
No, I love sunglasses, and wear them as much as possible.
I don t need prescription glasses, and I don t want prescription glasses, I don t like the look of a girl, wearing prescription glasses, sunglasses, yes.
Yes, it might sound crazy, but, I do like the look of men wearing glasses, I think, it makes them look, smarter, and more distinguished,
I really like your look.


I spend the rest of the afternoon with Ashley, besides being real good looking, she was a lot of fun,, outspoken, and very likeable.
To bad, she did not wear prescription glasses.
After a full weekend, we made arrangements to meet again, the next weekend.


After a few sunny, weekends together, Ashley, decided, she like to sleep with me in my tent.
Not long after, we enjoyed, each others body,.
Ashley, wanted me to wear my glasses, all the time, she told me, it really turned her on.
It was not hard to oblige, cleaning glasses, is no big deal.
What a summer we had.
To bad, Ashley does not wear prescription glasses, then everything, would have been even more perfect.


After the summer, Ashley, and I met as often, as we could.
To day, I received a phone call, from Ashley, she would like to meet me, at a certain restaurant, she had some very important, news.


When we met, and were seated, I ordered drinks.
While slowly sipping my drink, Ashley asked me, do you really love me?
Yes, Ashley, I do, I even have had thoughts, of asking you to marry me.
Kevin, I will accept your proposal.
I think we should get married as soon as possible, because, I am pregnant.
I almost choked, on my drink, Ashley, pregnant?
After ordering another drink, I let reality take over.
If, I had known, I would have brought you, an engagement ring. 
It is early in the evening, let us eat, and then, we will go, and I buy you a ring.
While eating, we discussed, wedding plans, and I would visit Ashley, at her place, to meet her family.


I guess, I was lucky, that after getting a promotion, and a big raise in pay, a little while ago, I had purchased a house, in a nice subdivision.
My plans were, to rent the house, well now, we wont have to look for a place to live.
When I showed Ashley, the house, she liked what she saw.


We had a simple wedding, and moved in to our house.
A couple of days later, I suggested, that we better get the address changed, on our drivers licenses.
So we went to the office to get it done.
Ashley, was told, her license, was about to expire, so she made arrangements, to get a new one,
Surprise!, Ashley also needed a vision test.
I, should not have been so happy, that she failed the vision test, but I was, now Ashley, would be wearing prescription glasses, instead of sunglasses all the time.
Ashley, could not believe she failed the test, but after her eye exam, a few days later, realized, her vision, was not as good, as she had thought.
After spending a long time looking, at frames, she decided, to take advantage of the two, for one sale,
and made her selection.
The optician, after taking some measurements, told Ashley, her glasses would be ready, the next day,




Ashley s story.
I was not very excited, about the idea, of having to wear, prescription glasses, I rather wear sunnies.
When I sat down, and the optician, handed me my glasses, I slowly put them on.
Looking around, I could not believe the improvement, in my vision, everything, I looked at, was more defined and clear, I had never expected, such an improvement in my vision.
Looking at myself, in the mirror, was happy to see, that the frame color, blended so nice with my hair.
There was something, I really liked was, that my eyes behind the lenses, looked brighter, and more colorful.
I had another real good look, and decided, that I looked fantastic, wearing glasses
When I walked out of the optical store, I had a better feeling, about wearing my new prescription glasses, than I ever did wearing my sunglasses.
Happy, and confident, I went home to, make some supper, and wait for Kevin, to come home from work.
When Kevin saw me, he hugged me, and told me, I looked fantastic.
I am glad, I failed my vision test, and I now, will be like Kevin, and love wearing glasses.


About 6 months, into her pregnancy, Ashley, complained, about her vision.
We made an appointment for, an eye exam.
After the exam, Ashley s prescription, was Â¾ diopter higher, than her last one, about 3 months ago.
Ashley now, wears her stronger, prescription, and she is so happy, she can see perfect again, but also 
loves the looks of her new stronger lenses.
When at home that night, Ashley, asked me, why are stronger lenses, more exciting?
I think, the depth of the lenses, and the showing of some rings, and the way, your eye look, behind the lenses, I feel the same way, I love it, every time I have an increase, in my prescription.
Kevin, I always loved wearing sunglasses, and never realized, wearing prescription glasses, is so exciting, and that I would be a happy prescription glasses wearing person.


Ashley, made me the proud father, of a baby girl.
Two years later, we became parents, of another girl.
We are very proud parents, and Kelley, and Megan, are growing into very pretty girls.


Time goes fast, and both girls are in school, Kelley, in grade 4 and Megan, in grade 3.
The girls, have asked a number of times, when are we getting to wear glasses.
Both girls, told us they the like the looks of glasses, with the nice lenses, just like mommy and daddy.
We told them, when they go for their yearly, eye exam, and they need to wear glasses, the doctor will tell them. 


The girls, have lots of friends, who spend a lot of time, at our place.
To day, being Saturday, we all were home, when Kelley s friend Cindy, came over, to show Kelley, her new glasses.
Kelley, of course wanted to try wearing the glasses.
Cindy, handed Kelley the glasses, after she put the glasses on, and looked at herself, and looked around,.
Mom, dad, how do I look? I love the glasses, I can see everything nice and clear, and love the way the glasses look, and feel.
I want to wear glasses.
Of course, Megan had to try the glasses, and gave us the same reaction, she to wants to wear glasses,
I asked Megan, for the glasses, and when looking at them, was pretty sure, the prescription was, about -0.50. or -0.75.
I asked Ashley, when the girls were due, for their annual eye exam, she told me in about 2 months.
So we tried, to convince the girls, that perhaps at their next exam, they might be prescribed glasses.


That night , Ashley, and I both agreed, the girls looked very cute, wearing glasses, and that Kelley, and Megan, must have inherited, our glasses fetish.
We kept a close eye on them, to see if they showed any vision, problems.


Kelley, met Cindy, to walk to school together.
Cindy, why are you not wearing your glasses?
I, hate them, I don t want anybody to know, I wear glasses now.
Did you bring your glasses?
Yea, I took them off, as soon as I left from home, and put them in my pocket.
Can I wear your glasses?
Here, and handed Kelley the glasses, I need them back, when I go home.
So, Kelley, proudly wore the glasses, and did not pay any attention, to any remarks, unless they were good.
The teacher, told her how nice she looked wearing the glasses, and hoped that wearing the glasses would improve her grades.
This daily routine, of wearing the glasses, went on for more than 2 weeks, until Cindy s mother came to school one day, and found out what had happened.
That night, Ashley and I decided, to get the girls eyes examined as soon as possible


The girls were all excited the day, of the eye exam.
Kelley, was first, and came out of the examination room, with a big smile on her face.
She handed me her prescription, right eye -1.00, left eye -1.25, certainly higher than I had expected.
Megan, was also prescribed glasses, her right eye -0.50, and her left 0.75.
The girls are so happy, and proud of their new glasses, and are wearing, their glasses all the time.


Ashley, that night, said, is it not funny, how when I hated the thoughts, of having to wear prescription glasses , I now love wearing prescription glasses, and can t wait, for an increase in my prescription.
