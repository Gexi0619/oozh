I am want to the one, wearing the strongest glasses, in our family. Part 1, and part 2






There are three girls in the James family, Susan, the oldest, and then Ashley, and Amy, the twins, 
All three girls have dark brown hair, and brown eyes, and very pretty faces.
Susan, is always jealous of her younger, identical twin sisters, she feels they are spoiled.
She likes to have something, that her sisters want, and they don't have, that sure would make her feel so much better.


At school, Susan's marks are not the best, she sometimes, is having trouble seeing the blackboard. When Cindy her class mate came to school wearing glasses, Susan had a chance to wear the glasses, and realized, she most likely needed to wear glasses, she sure could see everything far away when wearing the glasses, that she could not see before.
She asked Cindy, how she knew she needed glasses.
Cindy told her that when she complained to the teacher, that she could not read, what was written on the blackboard, the teacher send a note to her parents, suggesting to them, I should have an eye exam.
Now I, could have something, the twins did not have, eyeglasses.
As Cindy, had told her, Susan, asked the teacher for a seat closer to the blackboard, so she could see the board better.
The teacher who is myopic herself, made sure, that if she feels it her duty, when a student has a vision problem, the best she can do, is to notify the parents.
So the next day, the teacher, handed Susan an envelope, with a note for her parents.
Susan, was all excited when she went home, now she would have something, the twins did not have, glasses.


When, Susan, handed her mother the note, and she read it, said what does your teacher know about that?
Susan asked her mother, what did the note say?
That you should an eye exam.
Susan, told her mother that, the teacher wears glasses, and she might know something, we don't.
Well, I have to discuss this with your father, we don't know very much about glasses, and I sure 
would not like it, if any one of you girls, would have to wear glasses, people might think, I have defective genes.
When my mother handed the note to my father, who was asked to sign it, so I could take the note back to school, said, I don't like the idea, that any of my children would have to wear glasses, but I have heard at work, from some of my co workers, that quite a few of their children, are wearing glasses now.
Young peoples eyes theses days are looking, at electronics and other devices, and the different life style, seem to be causing more vision problems. 
I think, we should make arrangements for an eye exam, for Susan.


On a Saturday morning my dad, went with me, to have my eye exam, my mother was busy, taking the twins, to their dancing lesson.
I was all excited, I know that when wearing glasses, my vision would be better, but most of all, I would have something the twins, did not have.
While, I had my eye exam, I found out later, my dad had a long talk, with the optician.
She told him, he was all wrong, there is nothing wrong with having to wear glasses, and all young people should have yearly eye exams.
With all of to day's electronics, young peoples eye development, is under a lot of stress, which can cause vision problems, and should be looked after.
The optician, must have convinced my dad, about the importance of eye exams, because he made an appointment for the twins, to have an eye exam.


During the eye exam, the optometrist, asked me why I did not have an eye exam, before, you sure need to wear glasses, your prescription, is quit strong for a first time glasses wearer.
He gave me the prescription, to take to the optician, she would look after me.
When I walked into the store, I told my dad I needed to wear glasses, and I am to give the optician the prescription.
My dad asked the optician, to explain the prescription to him.
Well sir, the O.D. means the right eye, and it, reads, -1.50 , and the left eye O.S.- 1.25, and a little astigmatism, your daughter is myopic, it is a stronger than usual prescription, for a first time glasses wearer, she will need to wear her glasses, from when she gets up in the morning, until she goes to bed at night.
All my dad said, I see, I guess, I did the right thing making an appointment for the twins.
I pretty near died, when I heard him say that, I don t want the twins to wear glasses.


The optician, was very nice, and showed me the best looking frames, for my face shape and hair color.
and I am looking forward to wearing that nice looking frame, that I have selected.
After some measurements and the bill, we were told the glasses would be ready for pick up, 
at about 1 o'clock.
My dad took me to the food court in the mall, and treated me, while we were waiting for the glasses to be made.


When we went to pick up my new glasses, and after the optician, checked for a proper fit, I had a chance, to look at myself.
I loved my new look, I don t think, I could have found a nicer looking frame.
Looking around, was like opening my eyes, everything I looked at, looked so nice and clear.
I, love my new glasses.


When I came home, my mother told me, the glasses, look like fake glasses, they don't look very strong.
My younger sister, Ashley, who had heard us, came into the room and had a look at me, said you look nice wearing glasses, can I try them, please, I would like to know, what I would look like wearing glasses.
So I handed Ashley, my glasses, and when she put them on, said, wow, they are strong, everything I look at far away looks a bit fuzzy.
When she looked at herself, wearing the glasses, said I am surprised, how good I can look wearing glasses.
Well, we find out next week, when we have our eye exam, if I need to wear glasses, at least now I know, how I can look wearing glasses.


At school, the teacher, told me she was glad to see me wearing glasses, and told me how nice I looked.
When, Cindy, saw me, told me how good I look wearing glasses, and asked if she could try them.
I handed Cindy, my glasses, and when she put them on, told me they were stronger than hers, she could really notice the difference.
I am so glad, Cindy had told me about telling the teacher about my eye sight, because, after wearing the glasses for a few days, I sure notice a big difference in my vision, when, I take my glasses off.
Now, I realize, I will be wearing glasses for the rest of my life, if I want to see properly, but I don't mind, I have something the twins do not have, eyeglasses.


Amy, and Ashley, are due for their eye exam to day.
I really hope, they don't need to wear glasses, I like having something, that they do not have. 
My mother, took them to the optical store, I am home alone, wondering,


At the optical store, both, Amy and Ashley, had a great time, trying frames, while waiting for their
eye exam.
Mother, we would not mind having to wear glasses, we like the way we look wearing the frames.
Well, I hope you don't, I don't like the looks of glasses.
Then Amy, went in for her eye exam.
The optometrist, at the end of the exam, said, you are a little myopic, do you want to start wearing glasses now, and if you don't, you will need to wear them in less than a year.
Amy said, I don't know, I will have to ask my mother.
While, Ashley, had her eye exam, Amy, told her mother, what the optometrist had told her.
Well, I will have to talk to the doctor.
After the exam, was finished, the optometrist told Ashley, that she was more myopic than her sister,
and should be wearing glasses now.
The optician, told the optometrist, that the mother wanted to talk to him.
When the doctor, faced the mother, she said, what do you mean, does she want to wear glasses now, or after he next exam.?
So, very patiently, the doctor explained, the situation, with Amy, but that Ashley should be wearing glasses now.
To keep the twins, identical, they both ended up, wearing glasses, with the same style and color frames,
so they, still would look identical.


When they all came home, I nearly flipped, both of them wearing glasses, so much for me having something they did not,
I heard that Ashley, has a stronger prescription than Amy, I don't like that.
Well, I don't know how I am going to do it, but, I am going to have the strongest glasses prescription, in our family, I want to have something, that they don not have.
That night lying in my bed, wondered how I was going to do it, but I have to succeed, and be wearing the strongest prescription glasses, in our family.


I have been wearing, my glasses for about 6 months, now, and I am looking forward to my next exam, hoping, I will have a big increase in my prescription.
I am doing a lot of reading now, and keep the book as close to my eyes as I can, I have read, that it might help. making my vision worse.
I am young enough, and would like to induce more myopia. I am sure going to do all I can to succeed. 
I am looking forward to going to high school, and meeting, I, hope some new friends.
