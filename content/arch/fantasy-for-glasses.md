description: A curious fascination with glasses leads to an unexpected journey of self-discovery and newfound happiness.
---
I was in Grade 2 when one of my friend got his eyes tested and it was found out that he needed glasses,since then I was very curious about how glasses worked. What really happened between the glasses and eyes.I was very fascinated about glasses but didn't want to try them or get myself a pair of glasses. But I was attracted towards girls wearing glasses.As I grew older probably getting through college I wanted to own my pair of glasses but I could see clearly without glasses which meant my eye sight was good. But then my dad got him a pair of reading glasses and one day I tried them I could read with them but my vision was blurry. But I started using them frequently and then slowly my eyesight started getting worse.Finally I got my eyes examined and the optometrist told you have a cylindrical power of -1 and -1.25. Fairly talking I was quite excited and oredered a pair of glasses and quickly told one of my friends that I had glasses and I was very excited about it. I am pretty OK with the glasses and very happy.
