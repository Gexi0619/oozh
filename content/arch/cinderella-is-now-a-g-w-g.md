description: A young girl finds her late mother's glasses and uses them to transform her life at a royal ball.

Thanks to Puffin for the suggestion.

I was not very happy when my father remarried after my mother s death.
My mother was a beautiful woman, very loving and she also wore glasses.
I was always fascinated by the glasses she wore, they made her eyes sparkle.

The woman my dad married has two daughters, Annabelle and Joyce.
My stepmother spoils them and gives them anything they want.
They are not very pretty looking girls, and also very selfish.
My stepmother does not like me, and she treats me like a servant.
I know  why she does not like me,her daughters are fat and lazy, and I have lovely blond curly hair
and I am fairly tall and in good shape and full of ambition.
It is my job to clean up after her daughters, and do all the work around the house.
The only friend I have is Tom my old cat.
I have a way of communicating with Tom, when I talk to him he seems to understand me.

Lately  I have noticed that when I am outside everything seems to look fuzzy, it never did before,
and I don t know what to do about it.
After a while it came to me, that I might have the same problem as my mother had, and I need to wear glasses
I know my stepmother would not get me glasses, all the money she spends ii for her daughters
new dresses and candy.
When I was talking to Tom my cat, and mentioned my vision problems, he gave a loud meow and let the way, and I followed him to the attic.
I wondered why he brought me here, when I spotted an old trunk, it looked familiar, I think it had belonged to my mother.
When I opened the trunk , I got a real surprise, there were my mother s old glasses.
I carefully tried them on, and could not believe how well I could see wearing them
I was so happy,
Since I was able to see so well wearing my mother s old glasses , I wore the glasses all day.
When my stepmother and her daughters saw me wearing glasses , wanted to know where they came from.
After I told them , they told me that now I was the ugliest person they had ever seen.
The comments did not bother me , I liked wearing the glasses and be able to see so much better now, and they were my mothers.

I heard there was going to be a ball at the palace, the prince was looking for a bride, and all the young ladies from the area were invited.to the ball.
My stepsisters were all excited , and were getting new dresses and shoes for the occasion .
I was told that since I was ugly and wearing glasses there was no need for me to go, besides I had work to do.
I had to help getting  the girls dressed, and pity the expensive dresses did not make them look any better

After supper the carriage was ready to take them to the ball.
When they got there their mother told them to walk around so everybody could see how beautiful they were.
When the ball officially started  they found their seats  and sat there all night.

Left alone made me sad, I would have loved to go to the ball.
Tom,my old cat was vary restless , and I soon knew why, because  the Fairy Princess came to see me.
She told Tom the cat , that she needed some live mice .
When Tom the cat brought the mice she magically transformed them into horses
 A coachman appeared and hooked the horses  up to a beautiful coach.
The Fairy Princess dressed Cinderella into a royal blue gown 
Then she handed Cinderella  her glasses , which were silver with rhinestones .
When she helped Cinderella into the coach told her to make sure to leave the ball before the 
clock struck twelve.

When Cinderella arrived at the ball, she looked so beautiful everybody noticed her.
She looked so nice in her royal blue gown with her blond hair and her silver glasses.
When her stepmother saw her , was ready to kill her , because Cinderella was dancing with the prince, while her daughters were still sitting there waiting to be noticed.
The prince danced a few more times with Cinderella , he liked her beautiful hair and loved the looks of her glasses .
It was near midnight when the prince was ready to have another dance with Cinderella, that he noticed her going to the exit
He summoned a guard to stop her 
 Cinderella moved so fast that the guard who was supposed to stop her , ended up with her glasses in his hand.
She had made it in time to her coach, but was sorry she had lost her glasses.
In the meantime the guard handed the glasses to the prince , who handeled them very carefully.
The big question was who did the glasses belong to?
When she came home the Fairy Princess told Cinderella not to worry about the  glasses she had her old onens  so she would be able to see.

The next day the stepmother wanted to know where the fancy dress and the glasses came from.
and how she had managed to get to the ball.
But Cinderella would not tell her.

At the castle the prince was looking at those nice silver glasses , and wondered who that beautiful girl was  that wore them.
He asked for the  list of the names of who had been at the ball.
He then went to visit all of them.to find out who might have lost her glasses. 

Nobody he visited had lost their glasses , and none of them even looked like the girl he was looking
for.
When he came to the  home where Cinderella lived , the stepmother told her oldest daughter she had to wear the glasses, and pretend they were her glasses.
Mom I cannot see wearing these glasses.
So the mother said they must belong to my younger daughter,you see they both wear glasses.

The younger daughter put the glasses on, and tried to pretend she could see just fine wearing the glasses
The prince looked at her and said you don t even look like the girl I am looking for.
Mom can I take these glasses of , they are giving me a terrible headache, that happened when I tried Cinderella s glasses., they are awful.
Then the prince asked , where is Cinderella I like to see her.
The stepmother did not have any other choice than to call Cinderella
When Cinderella came in and saw the prince  bowed and blushed  she was wearing her old glasses  and an old work dress.
The prince only noticed her beautiful eyes behind the lenses of her glasses.
Here are your glasses, please put them on you look so nice wearing them
 Yes, you are the one , I know now that I want to marry.
You are the most beautiful glasses wearing girl I have ever seen, will you marry me?
The prince married Cinderella , and bought her many different pairs of glasses.
He loved his glasses wearing princess and they lived happily ever after.
