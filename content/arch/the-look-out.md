The look out.


Yes, I am looking forward, to the end of the school year, I will be graduating, and 
will be attending university, after the summer, to study, forestry.
I love trees and being outdoors.
The last two summer holidays, I have worked, for the forestry department, in the north part of our province, planting trees.
Yes, after all the timber is cut, we go and plant trees, to keep the forests growing, with the right kind of trees, that after growing up, will be use full, for the lumber industry.
Planting trees is hard work, the footing is not always, the best, weather changes, and insects, can make your day very miserable, but I love the outdoors, and the pay is good, so I can afford to go to university, and have some spending money.
We work for the department of forestry, and live in a bunk house, and after a days planting, and a big meal, are always ready to go to bed.


My parents, are very supportive, they like to see me working, and save some money, and that, I don't mind, a day of hard work.
I am the oldest in our family, I have two younger brothers, we are a happy, and healthy family. 


I have graduated, and now am busy, to get my packing done, for my trip, into the north country.


After a long train, and the a bus ride, I arrived at the foresters station, for my ride to the bunkhouse.
When I arrived there, was happy, to see a few familiar faces, from previous years, and to meet some of the new recruits.
To morrow, we start the planting, to night, we try to get to know each other.


After a big breakfast, we went to do our planting.
This year we are in an area, that is a real challenge, it had burned down, the previous year, and the footing is not good, and we sure were glad, when it was time, to go to the bunkhouse, for a good meal, and some rest.
After a few days of planting, I was back into the old grove, and work now is a little easier.
A few days later, after I had my lunch, was asked to come to the office, they wanted to see me, and asked me to bring all my belongings, why? I don't know.
I was driven, to the office, in a pick up truck, with all my stuff in the back.
I had no idea, why, they wanted to see me, at the office.
When in the office, I was asked to take a seat, in the superintendent's office, when he came in, shook hands, Megan, I have an important job for you.
You have seen, the fire look out tower, on top of the high hill.
The girl, who was working up there, has been in an accident, and we need a replacement for her right away, and I think, you are the right person.
Then, he explained to me, what I was expected to do, and I would be shown, how to use, the equipment, to locate fires, and every thing else that was required.
I would have to stay, at the outlook overnight, and would find everything I needed,
to make me comfortable.
He called, Peter, his assistant, to take me to the tower, to show me around, and to instruct me how to use the equipment.


I, am sure, it will take me a few days, to be able to do, everything right, I know now, what is expected of me, but I like the challenge, and it is a great learning experience., 
Because I am a bit of a loner, am sure, that I will enjoy the experience, and won't mind being alone.


The most important part, of my job, to look over all the tree tops, which looked to go on forever, and looking all fuzzy, in the distance, looking for any sign of smoke, and the possibility of a fire, locate the area, on the map, and figure out the exact location, and phone the information to the office.
I really enjoyed, the time I now have, for reading, using the computer, forwarding my daily reports, and regularly, checking for any sign of smoke, or fire.
I make my own meals, if I need something, I ask for it, and usually get it the next day.
I am able to phone my family, and keep them up to date.


What, I find very interesting is, that every time, that I am looking, over al the trees for something to report, I always seem notice something new, or different, that I had not noticed before.
Sometimes, I wish, I could see more,. 


A couple of days later, was a rainy day, and I had some time, to look around at everything, in the room, to make sure, I had not missed anything..
I looked in all the drawers and cupboards, and checked all the contents.
I was surprised, that when, I saw a cupboard, that I had not noticed before, there was a trash can in it,
Me, being nosy, looked at all the papers, and copies of previous reports, that were in there, and when, almost finished, sorting through the papers, noticed a glasses case, and wondered what it was doing in a trash can..
I opened the case, and there was a pair of glasses, with what I thought, a nice looking, tortoiseshell plastic frame.,
I put the glasses on, and looked in a mirror, to see what I look like, wearing glasses.
I was surprised how nice, the glasses looked on me, the colour blended, so nicely with my hair, and skin colouring, I liked that.
Wearing the glasses, I looked over all the tree tops, and wondered, if it was my imagination, that now, when wearing the glasses, I could see better. 
I took the glasses off, and then put them on again, to see if there was a difference. 
Soon, I realized, my vision was much better, when I was wearing the glasses.
When, I tried to read, wearing the glasses, I had a bit of trouble, to get the material I was reading, into proper focus, but I had no problem with the computer.
Do I need to wear glasses ?
I guess, I do, my distance vision, sure is much better, when I am wearing the glasses.
I looked at the case, and on the inside was a prescription, and the name, Cathy Johnson.


The next day, when Peter, my instructor, came, to check on me, and bring supplies,
I asked him, if Cathy wore glasses.
Yes, she does, she just started to wear a new pair, and told me she was going. to pitch her old glasses, she did not need the old glasses anymore.
That was, what I liked to hear, like they say, finders, keepers.
I now had, a pair of glasses to wear. 


Not long after, I was wearing the glasses, all day, and enjoyed, my improved vision.
When, Peter came, to bring supplies, he never seemed to notice, I was wearing Cathy's old glasses, I was glad about that.
After wearing the glasses, for a few weeks, I sure noticed a big difference, in my vision, when I took the glasses off.
After gaining some knowledge about glasses, and vision, using the computer, I now know, that I am myopic, and will be wearing glasses, for the rest of my life.
Now, I also, have some idea, about the prescription, that was in the glasses case.
It read O.D. - 1.50, O.S. -1.75.and a little astigmatism.
I realize, the prescription, must be just about right for me, because my vision sure has improved.
I will find out for sure, when, I am home again, and go for an eye exam.


To day, I received a message, to alert me, that thunder storms were expected, and the forest was very dry.
When the storm started, there seemed to be lightning every where, and not long after, I spotted, the start of a fire
I calculated, the area where it was, and phoned in the area, where the fire was. 
Not long after, I spotted another fire, and send to the office the location, of that fire.
I now realize, how much wearing the glasses, have helped me, I would have had a hard time spotting the fires, as quickly, if I had not worn my glasses..


The next day, the superintendent phoned me, to thank me for the quick response, noticing the fires, and giving, the proper location, and that both fires were small, and are under control now.
I am sure wearing the glasses, had been a big help.


It is time to go home, after an exciting, and educational summer.
When I was ready to go home, I met Cathy, who was now healthy again, after her accident, and was ready, to take over from me, as a lookout.
She noticed my glasses, and I told her my story,
Megan, I am glad, to see my old glasses put to good use, and you look very nice wearing them.


My mother, has made an appointment for me, at the eye doctor, and I am looking forward to it, I don't mind having to wear glasses.


When, I came home, wearing glasses, was the centre of attention, because, I am the first one, in the family to wear glasses.
When, I went for my eye exam, I wore my glasses.
When my I had my exam, told the optometrist the glasses story.
Well Megan, I am glad the glasses, were use full, but you will find your new ones, even better.
Now, I was now holding in my hand, my own prescription, for new glasses.
I noticed a fair increase, in my prescription, compared to the glasses, I have been wearing.
My O.D. is now -2.00 and my O.S. - 2.50..
I selected a pair of similar frames, as I have been wearing, for my new glasses.
When, my new glasses, were ready, and I put them on, noticed the increase in my prescription, to bad I did not not know I was myopic, if I had been wearing glasses. they sure would have made it much easier, to work in the look out.
