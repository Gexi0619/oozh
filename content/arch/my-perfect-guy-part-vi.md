I thought this was gonna be the last part but it's not. I'll try to upload the next one on monday  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“No babe, they’re nowhere to be found. They must’ve gotten buried under the mud” I Said
“Nicole this can’t be happening to me, I don’t know if I still have a spare pair. Please, please look again” He begged 
I was about to keep the lie but I saw him about to cry and my heart sank so I took out the glasses from my bra and I decided to damage them enough for him to need new ones. 

I took one of the ear pieces and twisted it but it was too much and the thing broke. I couldn’t just pop out one of the lenses cause that was an easy fix or he could get another frames so y rubbed the lens part with a stone and then I covered them with mud. I was about 2 meters away from him and it made me so hot the fact that he couldn’t even see where I was because he looked somewhere else but he pretended he was watching me. It was like a full blind guy. (I wonder how much does the strabismus and the high astigmatism affects his already poor sight?)
“I found them Mike!” I yelled pretending to be excited 
“Did you?!! Yeah!!! Honey you’re the best, give them to me please” He said 
“Oh no, Mike they’re all messed up. Let me clean them for you” I answered 
“I can clean them, give them to me” he said in a rush to get them right away. So I handed them to him.
Seeing him doing this stuff is the kind of things that I think about when I’m “pleasuring myself” and it works sooooo good.
He was on his knees pretending to see the lake but he was still far from it and when he wanted to grab water he realized he still had to walk a couple of steps. 
When he was finally able to feel the water he “washed” his glasses by touch, and tried them on.
 
“The little earpiece is missing, and they’re so foggy, I need soap to wash them better. Can we go home now? Please drive cause I can’t really see much out of them this dirty” He admitted 
 
So I did, I drove home and it was such an experience to see him trying to clean his glasses and putting them on the whole ride. The way he got his glasses so near to his face he was almost touching his eye in order to see the lenses aroused me so much. 
 
We got home and he ran inside to the bathroom. He was there for what it seemed like an eternity but it was more like an hour. 
“Is everything ok babe?” I asked
“No, they’re really messed up. We shouldn’t have gone swimming” He said and I could hear his voice breaking 
“Babe open the door please” I said soflty 
“No, I don’t want to. I hate my eyes so much, I would rather be dead than having to be this blind for the rest of my life. I’m so sick of everything, I hate not being able to see my face in the mirror, I hate not being able to see you enough when I open my eyes, I hate having to wear these awful things and still being so blind. I wanna die Nikki” He cried

What had I done?!! This was not the way things were supposed to happen, how could he feel this way? Was it really that bad?
“Mike what are you talking about honey? Please open the door. Please open babe” I started to get worried “Mike open up, MICHAEL!” I yelled
Thank god the door opened and he was there lying on the floor crying. He was devastated, I haven’t seen anybody like this. I felt so bad, so so bad for him
“Honey, it’s not as bad as it seems. You are brave, you’re strong, handsome, a great friend, an amazing lover, the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. Please don’t say you wanna die my love, I could not be without you” I started crying
We hugged and cried for hours, of course I couldn’t confess my “crime” so I only tried to make him feel better. 

It work out cause one thing led to another and suddenly we were making out right there in the bathroom. I could feel him getting hard, and so was I. I sat on top of him, still kissing him I grabbed his hands and started rubbing my breasts with them. I love his big manly hands. He knew how to do the job by himself so I left his already very excited hands do the job. 
I took his head with my hands and I kissed his ears, he loved that feeling. 


“Mike you’re a beautiful man with or without glasses. I love you so much, please remember that.” I said
“Take them off” He said
“What?” I asked
“The glasses, mine and yours… take them off. I can’t see that much with this dim light and I want us to be equal so please take them off” He answered
So I grabbed his and my glasses and I left them on the floor. He got up still caring me and I braced my legs around his waist. I was kissing him and he was carrying me with one hand and the other one was his guide. He took me to the kitchen and left me sitting on the counter. I really couldn’t see that much with my glasses off and if you have bad eyesight you might know how much light affects your vision. 


I felt his hands again rubing my breasts and then removing my clothes. He started to kiss my boobs and I loved when he did this. I had his head in my hands and I was already moaning with pleasure…
He grabbed me by the waist and stood me up, When I was standing in front of him, he pushed my head down. I already knew this was his favorite thing so I went on my knees. I dropped his pants to his feet and started doing my thing. 
I loved looking up and not being able to see his face at all. I knew he was seing less than I did and it made me hotter.
It took no time for him to grab my hair and pull me up (We like it rough), turn me around and accommodate his pennis into me. 
He was by far the greatest lover I’ve imagined. 
 
We then went to the living room and continued to make love for another while. When we were  done we hugged each other and fell asleep right there.
 
The next morning came and I woke up lying on his hard chest. I ran my fingers trhough his hair 

“Ohh good morning babe” He said
“Babe good morning, I didn’t know you were awake”
“I have been for a while but I love being here like this. Just you and I together” He said
“Mike I need to talk to you” I said “Yesterday you said awful things, like you wanting to die… Do you really want that?”
“I was tired honey, I am tired of living like this. I just can’t get over the fact that my eyes don’t work. I try to be ok with it but I’m not, that’s why I have the hardest time understanding this is something you want” He said
“What do you say if we go to the ophthalmologist today, then we can go to the optical place and maybe you can think about going to Dr. Charles by yourself” I said
 “It sounds good, but I’m not wearing my glasses. I can’t see anything through them, I guess they must have been scratched by the rocks. So even if I don’t want to, and as much as it hurts me to say this: I need you to hold my hand and guide me everywhere ok?” He asked peacefully 
“Of course my love, I’ll be your eyes if you can’t see, I’ll be your strength if you get weak” I said
“Is that a Celiné Dion’s song?” he asked
“It is, but I was trying to be romantic so please don’t spoil it” 
 
I got up and Mike stayed in bed with his eyes closed asking Alexa to play an audiobook for him. I did breakfast and my mind was set on doing something like eggs and bacon but at the end I went for sandwiches cause those are easier for Mike to eat, he doesn’t need to see cause he is holding it in his hands. 
We had breakfast in bed and occasionally I had to help him with the napkin that was the same color as our sheet, but he actually did a great job. I guess this isn’t the first time he goes through this?
 
It was time to take a shower so I held his hand and guided him to the bathroom, he knew his way perfectly around our home but I wanted him to feel safe, I felt guilty but I didn’t regret what I’d done. 
When we were in the bathroom, I opened the shower and went in, then I pulled him with me. I kissed him and I washed his hair with his shampoo. Then I rubbed his body with my hands and his shower gel, he got hard so I had to relieve his load with my hand. He was there, still, not moving, not seeing… Just existing and kissing me back when I kissed him. What a nice experience…
 
I got out of the shower and handed him his towel, he dried himself and placed the towel around his waist. 
Touching the wall he walked out of the bathroom. 

“Uhm babe, do you think you can help me choose my outfit?” He asked
“Of course honey, give me a sec.” I said
 
I chose my favorite outfit of his and he looked gorgeous!
 
I let him do everything unless he asked for help, and he did great. He went into the car and I headed to the Ophthalmologist.
