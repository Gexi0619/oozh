Prompt 1




I, started to wear glasses, when I was 4 years old.
Yes, I love wearing my glasses, and even have, a collection of glasses.
When, I started to wear my second pair of glasses,
I liked my first pair, so much, that I put them in my dresser drawer., to keep forever.
That started my collection, because, I could not part with any of the glasses, when, after an increase in my prescription, I started to wear new glasses.
Every year, my myopia increased, I had another pair for my collection.


I always, enjoyed looking and sort through all my old glasses.
Now, I wondered, how to get some more, glasses, for my collection..
This was not, to much of a problem, when I was older, because more of my classmates, were wearing glasses then.
Most of the kids, I knew, gave me their old glasses, and my collection slowly increased.


Because, it was no secret that I collected glasses, I had some given to me, by my aunts, and uncles.
I liked getting a good variety, of styles, and prescriptions, 


Riding, on the bus, one day, I noticed a pair of glasses, lying under a seat, I picked them up, and looked at them carefully, a very nice pair of bottom hinged glasses.
I went to the bus station, to hand them in, because somebody might be looking for them..
The lady, on duty, told me to put them in the box, with the other lost glasses.
I asked her what happened to the glasses on the box?
When the box is full, we get rid of them.


All those glasses, I hated to see them thrown out, because the box was almost full.
I looked at them, and went looking, through the whole box.
Another women, who saw me, said if you like the glasses, you might as well take the glasses, I am going to get rid of them to day, nobody seems to come, and look for their lost glasses anymore.
I, did not hesitate, and took them all, now I had some more glasses, for my collection.


When I came home, went to my room, and took the bag of glasses, and put them on my bed.
Then, I sorted the glasses, there were a couple of pairs, of very nice women’s glasses, a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, and some other pairs, I did not have in my collection, what a find,.
After I looked, at all the different prescriptions in the glasses, I put them with the rest of my collection.


By the time, I graduated, from high school, my glasses collection had grown to eighty two, different glasses.
I had all my old glasses, with prescriptions, of – 1.00, to my present, -7.75, in a special place .


I went to college, to become an optician, because I love anything, that has to do with glasses, that includes wearing glasses.
Studying, about something you like, is so much easier.
I sure, enjoy the practical courses,.


Every weekend, I work, in an optical store, to get more experience.
While working there, I was able, to get some nice glasses display boxes, for my collection. 
Now , I have all my glasses boxed, by style and prescription.


The son, of the optical store owner, is studying to be an optometrist.
I have seen him a few times, a very handsome glasses wearing man, I guess a few years older than I am, I sure like to meet him.
My dream did not come through, I did not meet him that summer.


The following year, after I graduated, I was offered a permanent position, as an optician, at the optical store.
Now, working full time, at something you like to do, is so satisfying.


Working, in the optical business, has some nice benefits, I have a free eye exam, every year, and a new pair of glasses, in the latest styles.
I am happy, my prescription has not increased lately, and now I have a number of glasses to wear, so I can wear a pair that blends with the outfit, I wear. 


A few months later, we had a staff meeting, and were introduced to Trevor, the son of the owner, who now is a doctor of optometry, and will be joining us.
He shook hands, with all of us,.
Wow, he is handsome, and a very kind type of person, I sure like him.


Working with Trevor, is so easy, and pleasant.
To day, he asked me, if he could examine my eyes.
I had an eye exam, about three months ago.
That does not matter, I would like to give you an eye exam.
Sure, go ahead, I don’t mind.
When I sat in the chair, to have my exam, he started by looking into my eyes, and said, I can see some, nice things there.
What do you mean?
I will tell you later.
Then, he checked my prescription, and asked me, if I would like an increase?
Why? Well you look so nice, when wearing high prescription lenses.
Can I think, about it?
Sure, you can let me know, Saturday, when we have dinner, at the Little Italy, restaurant, I will be at your place at, to get you.
I was stunned, dinner, with Trevor.


We had a nice dinner, and the evening goes fast when you have a good time.
Saturday dinner became a ritual, that I liked.


My parents, went away for the weekend, so I invited Trevor, to come to my house, for a home cooked dinner.
When Trevor came, he brought along a bottle of wine, that we drank, while eating dinner.
After dinner, we settled down, on the sofa.
I excused myself for a minute, to get my slippers, from my bedroom.
What I did not realize, that Trevor had followed me.
So, this is your bedroom, I like the decor, and he walked around, and looked at every thing, 
My blood froze instantly, as I realized too late, that my secret would be revealed. He opened the door of the cabinet in my bedroom, which kept hidden my collection of prescription glasses, a testament for my optical obsession.


Trevor, looked at all the eyeglass boxes, and said, Meghan, are you in the optical business selling glasses frames, or did you, bring these boxes home, from work
The boxes you are looking at, were empty, and were going to be thrown out, and I could use them, so I brought them home, to be used for my glasses collection. I have been collecting glasses, for a long time, 
I started to collect glasses, when I started to wear my second pair of glasses, I still have my first pair.
Here is the box, of all the glasses I have worn.
I, can’t believe it, this is fantastic, why did you not tell me ?
I did not think, it was important.
Well, I disagree, it shows your love for glasses, don’t be ashamed, there is nothing wrong having a glasses fetish, I have the same fetish.
After that, I showed him my complete collection, while we were sitting on my bed.


The following morning, after we showered, and had breakfast, before Trevor went home.


Trevor, came back in the afternoon, just after my parents came home.
My parents, and Trevor, talked for a while, then he asked my parents, if he could marry Meghan.
I could not believe my ears.
Then he asked me, to marry him, and gave me a beautiful engagement ring.
We all went out for dinner that night.


I am so glad, he found my glasses collection, that really, made things happen.
