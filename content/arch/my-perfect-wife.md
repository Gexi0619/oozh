My wife Katie and I, Logan have now moved into our new house.
We are college sweethearts, married 2 years ago and we are looking forward to starting a family.
My wife has a good figure, beautiful head of hair, very nice facial features, and large blue eyes.
I think she is perfect, and love her very much.
To night when I came home from work, Katie told me she had met our neighbors.
They are about our age, his name is Kevin, he works for an insurance company 
Her name is Kim, she is an attractive looking, glasses wearing lady, and they have 3 year old boy.
We have been invited for a little get together Saturday night.

When we went to visit our neighbors, we were greeted at the door by Kevin, a very pleasant person.
We were ready to sit down in the living room when Kim came into the room.
When I saw her, a strange feeling came over me, that I had never experienced before.
There was something striking about that woman, that I could not place.
When we sat down, had some very enjoyable conversation and refreshments, and we had a look at their boy sleeping in his crib.
I don t know why but I could not keep myself from constantly looking at Kim.
There was something about her, that attracts me very much, but I don t not know what it is.

The next day Katie told me she had noticed me starring at Kim quite a bit, and asked me why?
There is something about Kim that I cannot figure out, something that attracts and fascinates me, but have no idea what it is.
Katie said, she is pretty and has nice hair, the only thing different about her, she wears glasses.
I noticed that the lenses of her glasses, make you more aware of her nice blue eyes.
I think you are right, the way the lenses feature her eyes,  sure makes her look more attractive.
Never had I ever noticed anybody wearing glasses, that affected me like Kim s glasses. 
We both agreed we had a very pleasant visit.
Every time since when I see Kim, I get the same strange feeling I had when I saw her for the first time.
I can t understand, that when I see her sparkling lenses I get that feeling. 

Lately at work I noticed myself starting to look at every person wearing glasses.
I now realize that the lenses of the glasses a person is wearing can sure change their appearance and make some of them look so nice.
Now, I wonder what is happening to me, looking at people who wear glasses and liking the looks of glasses?
I now start to look at every women who wears glasses, and must say that most glasses wearing women look terrific.
I also start to wonder what Katie would look like wearing glasses, I would very much like to know.
I even had dreams about glasses, and my wife wearing glasses, am I going nuts?

Big news, Katie is pregnant, we both are very excited.
Next thing we heard was, that Kim next door is also pregnant.

Time marches on, both girls are about 5 months pregnant.
Kim told Katie that she has vision problems again, and expects it is pregnancy myopia. 
She has made an appointment for an eye exam to make sure.
I asked Katie if she had any vision problems?
She told me she could see as well as she did before she got pregnant.
I was a little disappointed, I sure would like to see my wife wearing glasses.
Kim was right she needed an increase in her prescription,.
When I saw her wearing her new glasses with the stronger prescription, I could not believe how nice she looked, her husband is a lucky man.
I keep on dreaming about the day I see my wife wearing glasses, I can t wait.

                                                           --------------------

Katie got a notice that she had to renew her drivers license.
When she went to the office to get her license renewed, she had to take the vision test.
After the vision test was told she would not get her license until she had an eye exam.
Katie could not believe it, she was sure they were wrong, she had perfect vision.
After she came home went to see Kim..

                                                                -------------------

Kim I feel terrible, I failed my vision test at the license office, and I am told to come back when I have glasses.
Katie there is nothing wrong with having to wear glasses, I am sure you will look fantastic wearing glasses.
What is it like having to wear glasses?
Glasses properly fitted are very comfortable.
It won t take you very long to get used to wearing glasses, and your vision will be perfect.
I started to wear glasses when I went to high school, and now would not be without them.
My husband loves my glasses look, and I am so sure your husband will to, I have noticed the way he always looks at me, I can tell.
I think I might be able to give you an idea how poor your vision is right now.
Can you read the number on the red house across the street?
No I can t,
Well I will try to show you, why you need to wear glasses.
Katie came back a few minutes later with a couple of glasses cases.
Here are the first glasses I wore.
She opened one case and handed me a pair of plastic framed glasses, those were my first pair, put them
on and look around, and look outside..
I carefully put the glasses on and looked around, I can t believe it, what a difference, I can see so much better now.
Then Kim handed me the other glasses, these were my second prescription.
When I put the second pair of glasses on could see even better, when I looked out of the window had no trouble reading the numbers on the house and was very surprised all the things I could now see, unbelievable.
The glasses were the half frame style, and were very comfortable to wear.
Kim told me I looked fantastic.
I went over to a mirror and looked at myself, this was the first time in my life that I looked at myself wearing glasses.
I had to agree with Kim, I looked good wearing the glasses.
Kim suggested I wear the glasses when Logan comes home.
You will be thrilled with his reaction, and I bet you, he will be very happy to see you wearing glasses.
So I did what Kim suggested and because I could see so well, wore the glasses going home.
I soon realized that wearing glasses is no problem, and I sure enjoyed the improved vision.
When I came home checked my make up and got all prettied up to wait for Logan to come home.,
to see his now glasses wearing wife, and to see his reaction.

                                                       ---------------------
As usual I opened the door and yelled Katie I am home.
I took of my coat and put my slippers on.

Hi, I am in the living room, when Logan came in I stood up and faced him.
I will never forget the look on his face, it was priceless.
Katie.........you look gorgeous,....... I love your new look.
Where did you get the glasses? 
What a surprise------, I can t believe it.
[Kim was right my husband likes my glasses look]
Logan why don t you sit down and I will tell you the whole story.
After kissing me a number of times, and telling me again, and again how nice I looked, Logan sat down.
I recited my story, and told him I had made appointments for an eye exam for both of us.
I thought my vision was perfect, and it turned out it was not, so I figure we better check yours to.
Logan agreed, and asked me to keep on wearing the glasses, so he can get used to seeing me wearing them.
I am so glad Logan likes to see me wearing glasses, I feel so much better now about having to wear glasses.

The next day I went to see Kim, still wearing her glasses.
I told her how right she was about Logan s reaction.
Kim smiled and said, I told you not to worry, guys love to look at glasses wearing girls.
I told Kim about our appointments and she thought it was a good idea, everybody should have regular eye exams.
She asked me how I like wearing the glasses.
I like wearing the glasses very much, they are very comfortable, and I love my improved vision.

 On the day of our eye exam, Katie wore her glasses.
When Katie had her exam, I looked around and tried some of the frames from the displays.
It was surprising how comfortable the frames are, and how they change your looks.
Glasses seem to give you a look of knowledge and make you look more confident.
Now I am wondering if I would like to wear glasses?

Katie entered the examination room wearing Kim s glasses.
At the pre exam, the assistant had checked the prescription, and passed all other test information to the doctor.
When the exam was finished Katie got a big surprise when the doctor told her there was so little change in the prescription she was wearing, that she could keep wearing her present glasses, unless she wanted to get a new frame.
Then she handed Katie her new prescription.
While Logan had his eye exam, Katie looked around and tried some frames, and selected some that she, and was sure Logan would like.

Logan enjoyed the eye exam, he found it very informative and interesting.
When his exam was finished, the doctor told him, he had some astigmatism,
and low hyperopic, and suggested he would notice an improvement in his vision when wearing glasses.
After the doctor handed him his prescription, Logan smiled, he had no choice now, he will be wearing glasses.

Katie loved it when she saw what Logan would look like wearing glasses, and they had a great time selecting good looking frames, and took advantage of the two for one sale.
Now they could not wait for all their glasses to be ready. 

When the glasses were ready, we had a hard time deciding which frame to wear. 
Because we were so happy with our new glasses, we invited Kim and her husband and son over for supper.
When they came we proudly showed them our new glasses, and received many compliments on our new looks.
Looking at Kim and then my wife realized that even with the different prescriptions the looks of the nice myopic lenses is what makes them look so beautiful.
I am a lucky man, my wife is beautiful,  wears glasses and will soon make me a father.
My perfect wife!!!!!
