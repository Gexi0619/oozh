Wishful Thinking.




There was a celebration to day, at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Brown.
The occasion was the birth of their baby daughter, Kirsten, a healthy 8 lb. Baby.
Now they have a sister for Kyle, who will be tree years old next month.
The grand parents are so happy, another grandchild.
After Mrs. Brown and Kirsten came home from the hospital.
Mrs Brown’s mother, who was staying at the house to look after Kyle, was so proud.
The next day, while the two ladies were having a cup of coffee, Mrs. Brown’s mother 
said do you think, your children, might grow up and become myopic, like you and I.
It seems to run in the family, all your older sisters children are wearing glasses now.
Well mom, if they are myopic, they will will have to wear glasses, but seeing so many of us wearing glasses they will think, that wearing glasses is normal.


Both Kyle, and Kirsten grew like they were supposed to, and were a joy for their parents, going to playgrounds, and learning to swim, and next thing, Kyle was ready for preschool.
A short time later, Kyle after he came home from school, told his mother, about Jenny coming to school wearing glasses, and wanted to know why she would be wearing glasses, and not him.
After carefully finding the right words, I explained to him, why people need to wear glasses,
so he would understand, that when you are supposed to wear glasses, is to help them see see everything perfect.,
That is why you have an eye exam, and after the eye exam, the doctor will tell you if you need to wear glasses, or not.
Kyle said, I like to have an eye exam.
So, I told him, he would have an eye exam, before he was to start grade one, in the fall.

When the time came for Kyle’s eye exam, he was very excited, he wanted to wear glasses.
When the exam was finished, and he was told he did not need glasses, Kyle was a very upset, and wanted to know why, so the doctor told him, most likely in a few years, when you are a little bigger.

I have noticed lately, that Kirsten, has lost interest in looking at all the story books.
Kyle, loves looking and reading all his books, and even, tells Kirsten the stories.
I try to keep a close eye on both of them, to see, if they might have any vision problems.

The following year, before Kyle was going into grade 2, he had his annual eye exam, and the doctor told him, perhaps next year, to satisfy him.
Next, he examined Kirsten, who now is 4 years old.
After a lengthy exam, the doctor told me that Kirsten has hypermetropia and which might be a lazy eye,
one eye is definitely weaker then the other eye, she definitely needs to wear glasses, and I would like to see her again in about 6 months.
Kyle of course was all upset, why would Kirsten get glasses and not him.
That was a tough one to explain.
Kirsten was very co operative, and when she got her glasses, wore her glasses from early in the morning till she went to bed at night.

Six month later, when Kirsten, had her eye exam, the doctor increased her prescription 1/2 diopter, on both eyes, and was satisfied with the improvement of the vision, in Kirsten’s lazy eye.
Kirsten, wanted to select her own new glasses frame, and she fell in love with, a light blue frame.
She got her new glasses, and was so proud of her new glasses, it was a pleasure to watch.
When she came home, Kyle commented on how much larger her eyes looked, they look like cow 
eyes.
Kirsten started to cry, she was very upset, about Kyle’s comments, and I realize, that with lenses that thick, Kirsten will get lots of nasty comments.

At the following year’s eye exam, Kyle was prescribed glasses, for myopia, which I had expected.
Kyle did not want to wear glasses like Kirsten, and she teased him that he was mister four eyes now, and to join the club.
When Kyle got his glasses, Kirsten mentioned she loved the looks of his lenses, and wished she was myopic, she likes the other lenses, much better than her own magnifying glasses, wishful thinking.

Kirsten, has a girlfriend, Jenny, and Kristen, have been friends since preschool, 
Jenny, is a very pretty girl, with blonde curly hair, and about the same height and build, as Kristen. 
This fall Kirsten, and Jenny are going into grade 4 , they both are real good students, and both have top marks on their report cards.
Kirsten told me, she is not being teased about her glasses anymore, so nice to hear., and she also told me that Jenny is wearing glasses now, and three other students.
She also mentioned again, that all the students who are wearing glasses now, are all myopic, and she loves the looks of the myopic lenses, and wishes she were myopic to, she does not mind wearing glasses but hates the looks of her lenses.
She sure would like to be myopic, wishful thinking.


Kirsten’s story.

I like wearing glasses, but I hate my coke bottle lenses.
O yes, I have tried to wear contact lenses, but I don’t like them, I rather wear glasses.
I have some dates, but cannot find a guy, who likes me the way I am.
After finishing high school, I took a business course, and I will be starting my new job next week.

Arriving at the office where I will be working, was surprised how nice everybody was.
I soon felt right at home.
Amy, who works at the desk next to me, and I soon became friends. 
She is like I am, she wears glasses, but is myopic, and has a very strong prescription, which makes her eyes look very tiny.
She told me she is like me, she likes wearing glasses, but hates her strong lenses, which make her eyes look so small, like at at the end of a tunnel.
We get along well, and sometimes, go barhopping, we get a big kick out of guys buying us a drink, so they can stare at our glasses, and have some dumb questions.
It seems, some guys like the look of strong glasses, but we have not met one, who we consider is a good catch.

One day, when we were having lunch, Amy told me, here is a new eye doctor in town, he does lasik, 
I have been told previously, that with my high prescription, they cannot laser me, but from what I have heard, he wants to see the patient’s prescription , and then makes his decision, I have an appointment with him to morrow.

After her visit to the eye doctor, Amy told me, that he could not eliminate her need for glasses, but
would be able to reduce her prescription significantly, so she is going back next week, and she hopes for the better, I cannot wait to see the results. 

Three days later Amy, came back to work, wearing a pair of brand new glasses.
When I had a chance to talk to her, she told me the whole story.
The doctor, when he was ready to start, had asked Amy, if she had changed her mind, that she was sure, she wanted wanted -3.00 glasses, instead of her -15.00 glasses, which she now was wearing.
After she had told him that is what she wanted, the doctor went ahead and did the procedure.
Amy, is so happy with the results, and loves the looks of her new glasses, and I agree, she looks fantastic, and I would love to wear glasses like that, instead of my own, coke bottle bottom glasses.
Now I am looking forward to my appointment, and find out what might be possible.

I sure was nervous when I went for my eye appointment, I had never been to a specialist, and had no idea what to expect.
When I met the doctor, and after talking to him, I felt more at ease.
When he asked me what I would like, I told him, that I like wearing glasses, but would like to be myopic.
Well Kirsten, how myopic?
I always liked lenses for myopia in about the minus 3 to minus 5 range, they look most attractive to me.
So the doctor told me if that is what you want, I will have to give it some thought, but first, I want to check your eyes, and then I want to see you again next week., and he might be able to start with some procedures.

When I went the following week for my appointment, the doctor greeted me with a big smile,
and told me that today he would perform a miracle.
He mildly sedated me, and strapped my head down, so I could not move my head, and started.
After a while, which had seemed like forever, he was finished.
When I was able to look around, everything close looked clear, but when looking at distant objects, everything was so blurry, I could not see anything clear.
When I told him, the doctor said fantastic, you now are myopic, your wish came through.
The doctor then, put the phoropter in front of my eyes,.
Shortly after he handed me my prescription, which I had no trouble reading, O.D.-4.25, O.S.-4.00.
Now I could no wait to get my new glasses, because I could not see well enough to function.
After a long wait, the optician handed me my new glasses, I put them on, and first thing I did,
was look look in a mirror, there I saw my eyes bright and shiny, behind the lenses, I had always wanted, which showed some rings, I loved my new look.
I could not believe it, my eyes behind myopic lenses, something I had wished for a long time.
My wish fulfilled.
