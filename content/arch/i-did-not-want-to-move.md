I did not want to move.




I am devastated, and I feel like crying, we are moving to a new town, my dad got a promotion , and 
I was told to day, we are going to move before the end of August.
Just when I was looking forward, to start high school with my friends, Amy and Megan.
My two older brothers are all excited, they are looking forward to playing on the big town high school football team.
All I can think of now, is packing my belongings, leaving my friends, and leaving all my familiar surroundings.


My name is Abbey, I am the youngest in the family, I have dark wavy hair, and I am told, I look a lot like my dad.
My mom, has beautiful blonde hair, and she wears glasses all the time, my dad only wears glasses for reading.
We are a healthy and happy family.


The moving truck is gone, and I am now very busy, arranging my new bedroom, I like my new room, which is large, and bright, because of the large windows.
There is a nice window seat, and from there I have a great view, of the whole street, I like that.


A few days later, sitting on the window seat in my room, I noticed a couple of girls about my age, coming out of the house across the street, they walked down the street toward the bus stop.
I decided, that I would like to meet them, I would go there later to day, and introduce myself, you never know, I can sure use a friend.


My hair combed, and looking my best, I crossed the street, and rang the doorbell.
A very nice looking Lady, opened the door, with a big smile.
Hello, are you the young lady, that now lives across the street? 
Yes mam, Abbey is my name, 
I noticed a girl about my age leaving here with another girl, this afternoon, 
since they look about my age, I wonder, if they would be so kind, to show me where the high school 
and some other important sites of this town are, so I can learn to find my way around.
Abbey, please come in, I call Emily, my daughter, so you can meet her.
Emily, is a very pretty looking girl, with nice, dark blond hair.
As it turns out, Emily is the same age as I am, and will be starting high school this fall.
She told me that the other girl I saw, was Sophie a class mate, then she invited me up to her room.
We sure seem to like each other, and after chatting away for a couple of hours, I went home, after we had made arrangements to meet again to morrow, she is taking me to the big shopping mall.


The next day at the mall, while we were having some refreshments, at the food court, Emily called out, Ashley is that you? A girl our age came over, and sat down with us.
Ashley, I like you to meet Abby, she is new in town, and will starting high school with us.
Are you getting ready for school?
Yes, I had an eye exam, and I am told I should be wearing glasses, and I am waiting for them, to get my glasses ready.
Emily, seemed all excited, and asked when will your glasses be ready? 
I am supposed to get them in about half an hour.
Would you mind, if we come with you, when you are going to get them, I love to see how you look wearing glasses..
You can come if you want to, I don’t mind.
So, about a half hour later, three girls walked into the optical store.
I could not believe, the assortment of glasses that were on display, and because Ashley was told her glasses would be ready in about 10 minutes, what else is there to do, then look at all the frames on display and try them.
Emily, was so excited trying frames, and I must say, she would look fantastic wearing glasses.
I tried some, and noticed that wearing glasses, sure makes you look different., reinforcing the fear of having to wear glasses, I don’t want to wear glasses.
When, Ashley’s new glasses were ready, Ashley, put her new glasses on and had them fitted, then she turned her head and looked at us., and asked, what do you think?
Ashley sure looked nice wearing glasses, and we complimented her on how nice she looked wearing glasses, she thanked us and said, I am pleasantly surprised how good I look wearing glasses.


On the way home, Emily told me how she would love to be wearing glasses, I have always loved the looks of glasses.
That really surprised me, I did not realize, some people wanted to wear glasses, I sure don’t want them.
That night at supper I told my mother about Emily, and my brother told me that a lot of guys now like girls who wear glasses, I could not believe it.
That night lying in my bed, and recalling my day, realize that wearing glasses nowadays must be a 
lot different than it used to be.


To day I asked my mother, why we don’t have regular eye exams.
She told me, that all of us had an eye exam at the age of three, and again before we started school.
Your dad and I think, that if you have vision problems, you will be told when they do the vision screening at school., or you might complain that you cannot read what is on the black board.


Emily and I walked to school to day, and Emily told me that she had looked at all the girls in our class, and that more then half of them, are wearing glasses now, I wished I was one of them. 
I asked her when was your last eye exam?
I never had one.
Why don’t you have an eye exam, if you want to wear glasses, they might tell you you should wear them, you never know.
Abbey, I think you are right, I will ask my mother, see if she will let me.


Both my brothers are playing football, for the school team now, and I am so proud of them.
Matthew, the youngest of the two, told us in his grade they are offering a driving course, and he plans to take it after the mid term exams.
I like my new school, I have made some friends, and like the courses, I am taking.
To day, in math class, I was sitting in my regular seat, and Ashley always sits across the isle from me,
we try to help each other when we need to.
For some reason, to day, I had a difficult time copying, what was on the blackboard.
When, I asked Ashley about it, she jokingly said, you most likely need to wear glasses, would you like to borrow my glasses, and see if they help you?
You think I might need to wear glasses?
It is possible, I understand that your vision can change, and you are not even aware of it when it does.
Here try my glasses, and she handed me her glasses.
I put the glasses on, and looked at all the writing on the blackboard, and realized that when wearing the glasses, I had no problem reading everything..
So while wearing the glasses, I copied all the information.
Ashley, I hate to say it, but I think you are right, I had no problem seeing the blackboard wearing your glasses, thank you, for letting me try them.
On the way home, I told Emily, about wearing Ashley’s glasses, so she said what are you going to do now?
I don’t know yet, I don’t really want to wear glasses.
I soon got in the habit of borrowing Ashley’s glasses, to finish my notes.


The mid term exams are finished, and to day, Matthew came home in a bad mood.
My mother asked him what had happened.
I did not pass the vision test for my drivers license, and cannot get it, until I come back wearing glasses.
Well, my mother said, I must have past on the myopic bug, I will make an appointment for you., and 
don’t worry, having to wear glasses is not the end of the world.
I now realized, that the myopic bug must have gotten me to, so I hesitantly, told her about wearing Ashley’s glasses, to see the blackboard.
Well you should have told me before, so now I will have to make 2 appointments.
The next day, when I told Emily, she said, I am so jealous, why you, and not me?
I am still not happy, I don’t want to have to wear glasses, I can see everything just fine, except the writing on the board in math class.


The day of the eye exam, I got a real eye opener, when I realized how much trouble I had reading the letters on the wall chart.
When the exam was finished, I was told to wear my glasses full time, and to to make sure, I have another exam in less than a year.
When the doctor handed me my prescription, I noticed a – 1.50, and a – 1.75 , and when I looked at Matthews prescription, it read -1.25 for each eye, my prescription looks higher than his, I now wonder what I will I be able to see when wearing glasses, that I could not see before.
My mother was shocked when she saw my prescription, and said I did not realize your vision was this bad, she sure was a big help, in finding the right frame for me.
Now, I will have to wait to find out how much difference in vision my new glasses are going to make.


When our glasses were ready, my brother got his first.
Looking at him wearing his new glasses, I could not believe how handsome he looked, and his comment when he looked around, I can’t believe it, everything in the distance looks so nice and clear.
When I put my new glasses on, immediately noticed how much stronger my prescription is, then in Ashley’s glasses.
Looking at myself, realized, my mother sure knows, how to pick the right kind of frame, I am surprised, I look this good wearing glasses.
I realize now, I have no choice, either wear your glasses and see properly, or go around squinting
and have trouble seeing things.
When my brother and I came home, we received some nice compliments, which made us feel better.


It did not take me long to become a full time glasses wearing person, and to appreciate my perfect vision, and believe it or not, started to like having to wearing glasses.
I now prefer my glasses wearing look, and feel naked if I don’t wear them.


About 6 months later, I noticed that my vision was not as clear as it had been.
So I had another eye exam, and my prescription increased 1/2 a diopter on each eye
I don’t know why, but I loved the looks of the stronger lenses, and the doctor told me, that he expected that my prescription will keep going up, and wind up with a -4 .00 or -5.00 prescription when I stop growing, that does not scare me, I now really like the look of glasses with a stronger prescription.


When Emily saw my new glasses, told me I never looked this good before.
I offered Emily my old glasses, so she could wear glasses to, but she cannot see when wearing them, and gave them back to me.
Ashley still wears the same prescription, and does not mind, like she says, I can see what I want to see.


It soon will be a year since we moved, I have lots of friends, and I like the school I go to and it is hard to believe that I went from a girl who did not like glasses, to a happy glasses wearing person, I am not sorry that we moved, I love the way things have all turned out.
