description: Kevin's desire for glasses becomes a reality when he receives a surprise gift from his friend's sister.
---
It started at our boys club.

Mike, Logan and I, Kevin, live on the same street and have been friends since grade one.
Our clubhouse is an old shed in our back yard, and we spend a lot of time there.
During the summer break we play a lot of baseball.
All three of us think we are pretty good players, you are supposed to be the best, when you are in your mid teens..
Lately we noticed Logan not playing as well as usual.
We asked him what his trouble was.
I have trouble seeing the ball coming.
I think I need glasses, as you know everyone in our family wears glasses, and most likely I have the same vision problem as the rest of them. 
Well. we are sorry to hear that, it must be awful having to wear glasses. 
I don t think wearing glasses can be that bad, I never hear any complaints about having to wear glasses, and my sisters are always get very excited when they get new glasses.

About a week later Logan walked into our clubhouse wearing glasses.
We told him how smart he looked.
I asked him, what it was like having to wear glasses.
Well, I can t believe the improvement in my vision, the glasses are very comfortable to wear, and I kind of like my new look. 
Can I try your glasses?
Logan handed me his glasses.
When I put the glasses on, really liked the feel of the frame on my face, they made me feel kind of sexy.
When I looked around was surprised that everything looked so nice and clear.
Wow, I think, I would not mind having to wear glasses.
Mike tried the glasses, but did not like them.
Logan put his glasses back on said, now let s go and play ball.
We had a good time and Logan sure played much better.
After the game when Logan and I walked home together, he invited me in.
On the way to his bedroom I met his sister Megan, a real good looking glasses wearing girl.
What do you think of Logan s new glasses?
I think he looks fantastic,  I would not mind having to wear glasses, if I can look that good.
Logan give Kevin your glasses, I would like to see how he looks wearing glasses.
After I put Logan s glasses on, Megan told me I looked very nice, I think you should be wearing glasses.
Well if I had glasses I would wear them, I love the feel of them and can see pretty good when wearing them.
When we went to Logan s bedroom, I was still wearing his glasses.
I notice you sure like my glasses, sorry you can t have them.
Reluctantly I gave Logan his glasses back. 
I really enjoyed wearing the glasses.
Now I know for sure that I want to wear glasses, but how to get them?
After the eye exam I had last year, I was told my vision is fine.

When at home that night, all I could think about was wearing glasses.
I did not realize that there is so much information about vision and glasses on the computer,
and I had a great time finding a lot of new information.. 

That night in my dream, Logan s sister Megan, came into my room and asked me why I was not wearing my glasses?
I don t have glasses, I wish I did, I would love to wear glasses.
Here is a pair of glasses for you.
You can have them, but you have to promise me you will wear the glasses all the time.
After I put the glasses on, and she told me that I looked fantastic, then she was gone.
What a beautiful dream.
The next time I saw Logan, I told him about my dream. 
He laughed and told me he would tell his sister.

A couple of days later when Logan and I were walking home he said, I think Megan wants to see you.
When we were playing some video games, Megan came into the room. 
Kevin I have a present for you.
When I looked up, Megan stood there with a big smile on her face and handed me a glasses case.
We have quite a few pairs of old glasses lying around, and I am sure these glasses will look very nice on you.
The prescription is not to strong and you should be able to see reasonably well when wearing them.
I opened the case, and there was a nice pair of metal framed glasses.
When I put the glasses on and looked around,  was surprised how well I could see.
Kevin, I love your new look, you sure look good wearing glasses.
Logan laughed, I should not have told Megan about your dream.
I had no idea she was going to give you a pair of glasses, well now you have your wish, 
and I must say you do look good wearing glasses.

I really enjoyed wearing the glasses whenever I could,  my vision soon was perfect when wearing them, 
Every time I was at Logan s place and wore the glasses, Megan came in to say hello and tell me how nice I looked.
Because I now could see so well, started to wear the glasses in all my classes at school.
I received a few comments, some good some bad, I did not care I loved wearing the glasses.

After wearing the glasses for about a month, and enjoying wearing the glasses, I felt obligated to show Megan my appreciation for getting me the glasses. 
I liked her as a person and her very attractive glasses wearing look, and invited her to go and see a movie with me.
She smiled, yes Kevin I would like that very much.
The next Saturday Megan and I went to the Mall movie theater.
Megan looked so attractive, wearing her glasses,  a little make up, and her hair looked so nice.
I told her how nice she looked, she thanked me, you look pretty good yourself wearing glasses.
When we were seated and the movie was ready to start, Megan asked me how I enjoyed wearing the glasses, I noticed you are wearing them at school.
I love the glasses and can see perfect now when wearing them.  
I have a surprise for you, she handed me a pair of plastic framed glasses.
The prescription in these glasses is a little stronger then your present ones, why don t you try them.
As soon as I put the glasses on, Megan looked at me, I like the looks of these glasses even better.
Then the movie started.
I realized the glasses were stronger, but it did not take me long to feel comfortable wearing the stronger prescription.
We enjoyed the movie, and I found out Megan is a good kisser, and bumping into each others glasses is kind of sexy.
After the show when we sat down in the food court having some refreshments, I asked Megan where do you get all these glasses.
My older brother who is at university started to wear glasses at about the same age as Logan.
I know where he keeps his old glasses, and the glasses you are wearing now were his second pair.
There are two more pair, all with a little stronger prescriptions.
When your brain is used to wearing this prescription we can try the next pair, if you want to.
I love the looks of stronger lenses, and you look so adorable wearing glasses.
After wearing the stronger glasses for a few months my vision was perfect when wearing the glasses, but when I took the glasses off, really noticed that I had trouble seeing far away objects.. 
At our next date, when I mentioned my distant vision problem,  Megan told me she has another another pair of glasses with a stronger prescription ready for me.
Megan I don t know, I like to wear glasses full time, but I now have a real problem with my vision without wearing glasses.
I know now, that I should be wearing glasses full time to see properly.
How am I going to tell my parents. 
Well you told me you had an eye exam over a year ago, suggest to your parents you should have another eye exam.
Since you have been wearing the stronger prescription for some time, I am sure you will be myopic and prescribed glasses.
Yes, the way my vision is right now, I think you are right,
I will talk to my parents to night.

When I talked to my mother that night, she told me that she would make all the arrangements at the optical store for an eye exam, and for glasses if they were necessary.
When I had my eye exam, the optometrist wondered what had happened to my vision since the last exam.
A little over a year ago your vision was 20/20, now it is 20/80.
You will have to wear glasses full time with this prescription, your right eye is  -2.25,
and the left eye â€“ 2.00.
I like to see you again in 6 months, I am sure you might need another increase then.

Good, now I can wear my glasses all the time.
Megan who had come with me, congratulated me on becoming a full time glasses wearer.
She smiled when she saw my prescription, you are going to look so nice.
Megan suggested the frame I should get, I agreed it looked sharp.

A few hours later I walked into the kitchen, and asked my mother, how do you like my glasses?
Kevin, you have to wear glasses? Poor baby, and they look so strong!.
However you do look very studious wearing glasses, do you have to wear them all the time?
Yes, I do, but I don t mind, I can see so much better now,  and I am sure it wont take me long   
to get used to wearing the glasses all the time.
So now I am wearing my glasses all the time and loving it

Megan had an eye exam and another increase in her prescription, she is -4.00 on the right and -3.75 on the left eye.
She loves her new glasses, we both love the look of her stronger lenses.
Well, Kevin it won t be long and your lenses will look just as nice as mine. 

Megan, is now my girlfriend, and at our next date, handed me the stronger glasses,
she had mentioned before. 
I noticed right away that the glasses looked identical to the glasses I am wearing now. 
She knew what she was doing, when she helped me select a frame for my new glasses.
I think the prescription in these glasses is about -3.00, or a little stronger.
After putting the stronger glasses on realized it would take me a while to get used to them.
Since the frame on the glasses looks exactly the same as the one on my prescribed glasses, I started to wear them all the time, nobody seemed to notice.
I loved the looks of the stronger lenses which show a bit of a ring, and after a few weeks could see reasonably well.

On our next date Megan told me that her older brother was home.
He cleaned out all his dresser drawers, sorry no more glasses to get used to, he gave all his glasses to charity.
Well at my next eye exam, I most likely have another change in my prescription, if not, well I got my wish of wearing glasses full time.

When I think about it, it all started when Logan came to the boys club wearing glasses.
After trying his glasses, and enjoying the feel, and looks of them was the time that my wish for wearing glasses started.
Off course I can t forget my dream, and your help to make me a full time glasses wearer.
Thank you, Megan!
