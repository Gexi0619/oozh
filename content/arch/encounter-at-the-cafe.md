Encounter at the Cafe
-----------------------------

It was one bright sunny day when I walked into the cafe, thereupon I saw this lovely woman lounging on one of the chairs by an outside table: I quickly noted that she wore glasses and had wonderfully long legs. She also appeared to be alone. I went inside and got my usual coffee and cake, then came out to sit at a table nearby. I couldn't keep my eyes off her: she was old, about ten years more than me, but time hadnâ€™t 
eroded her looks much, scarcely touching her trim figure and only adding a couple of grey hairs to the blonde ones flowing alluringly down each side of her head and over her shoulders. And, oh, wow, she wore such a pair of glasses! Big round plastic specs to dream of and die for, with a brown tint to the frames at the top which slowly melted into clear plastic as it neared the bottom. She was very much myopic: the lenses she wore were myodisks, with large bowls, I suppose 40mm or so. Helpfully she briefly turned her head; the sun danced across her plano fronted lenses. I saw they were around 10mm thick, and I estimated her lenses corrected about minus 18 of myopia. The large bowls in the large frames looked so appealing, I think she must have had this combination so she could have the large frames without too much edge thickness, but also with a compromise of a quite large bowl to gain on attractiveness. I did not see her squinting: I thought perhaps she had 20/20 vision.

I was almost taken aback when I heard someone say,
'hey! Either quit staring at me, or come and talk to me.'
It took me a moment to realise that it was indeed her who was addressing me... oh, of all the things that could make my knees wobble, that was probably the best and surest. She beckoned me over, smiling gaily. Numbly I got up and went over to her, then sat in front of her. It was one thing to view and admire a lovely bespectacled woman from afar, but quite another to sit and speak to them, thus I was utterly tongue-tied. Fortunately she was not. Looking straight me, she said,
'well, my name is Lisa... and you are?'
I told her my name. She brushed a curl of hair from where it hung over the front of her glasses, then said,
'tell me all about yourself.'
