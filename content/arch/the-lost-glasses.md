The lost glasses.


I don’t know, what to do.
Lately, my husband keeps on telling me, about all the girl, he sees in his office, who are wearing glasses, and how nice they look, and how he now, likes the looks of glasses on women, and how nice their eyes look, behind the lenses.
I think, he has a glasses fetish.
I like wearing sunglasses, and have a few pairs of them, but never get any comment, when I wear them.
Talking with my girlfriend, about my husband’s fetish, she suggested, to go for an eye exam, and talk to the optometrist about it, he might have a solution, for my problem.
Now, I have an appointment, for an eye exam, to morrow.


I told the optometrist, why I had my exam, and he assured me, he will find a solution.
At the end of the exam, the optometrist gave me my prescription, and said, now you can wear glasses ,to please your husband, you are myopic, and should wear your glasses all the time.
I could not believe it, I am myopic.
There was a 2 for 1 sale, so I selected two frames , which I thought 
looked, really attractive, and quite sure, my husband will like.


While waiting for my glasses to be made, I did some shopping.


My glasses were ready, and when I put them on, and looked around, could not believe, the improvement, in my vision.
After having a look at myself in the mirror, I was very happy, with my new look, and I am sure, my husband, will like my new look to.. 


The optician, suggested, I wear my glasses all day, with your prescription, of – 1.50, and -1.75, you will soon get used to wearing the glasses, and enjoy your improved vision.
Now, I am wearing the frame, that I really like, so I have the other pair of glasses, in my shopping bag
.
I was ready for a coffee, so I went to the food court.
While drinking my coffee, I took my second pair of glasses, out of my shopping bag, to have a real good look at them.
I was surprised, the lenses looked stronger, than I had expected,
but I was happy, with my frame selection.
When I was finished, I slid the glasses case, into my shopping bag, beside me, what I did not realize, I missed the bag, and the glasses case fell on the floor.


When I came home, I could not find my second pair of glasses, did I lose them ?.
I phoned the mall office, and they told me to leave my phone number, so they could call me, when somebody had found my glasses.


That night, when my husband came home, and he saw me wearing glasses, loved my new look, and what a night, we had.

Cindy, and her friend Amy, were getting tired, while shopping in the mall.
They sat down, at the food court, for some refreshments.
While, enjoying their drinks, Cindy spotted a glasses case, under the next table.
After picking them up, she opened the case, and looked at a very nice looking pair of glasses.
She could not resist, trying the glasses, and after she put the glasses on, got a real shock, when she realized, that when wearing the glasses, her vision improved so much. 
Wearing the glasses, she could see everything, that she looked at, so nice and clear.
Do I need to wear glasses?


Cindy, you look very attractive, wearing glasses, you should get yourself a pair.
Amy, I can’t believe, how these glasses, improve my vision.
Now, I am sure, I will have to get my own glasses,.
I will make arrangements, for an eye exam, but I think, first, I will have to go to lost and found, and give them the glasses, I am sure, somebody will be looking for them.
When I, inquired, they asked me for my phone number, because they don’t want every found article, in the office.
Now, I have a pair of glasses, to take home with me. 
I wore the glasses going home, and was very comfortable wearing the glasses. 
I still cannot believe how wearing glasses, can change your vision, that much.

There were lots of questions, when I came home, wearing glasses.
I told them, how I got the glasses, and how my vision had improved, wearing the glasses.
Well Cindy, you will, have to go and have an eye exam, and get your self, some nice looking glasses.
I am surprised, that my younger sister Sadie, did not ask me if she could try the glasses, the way she looked at me.
I made an appointment for an eye exam, and then, started to get ready for my date, with Logan, for to night.
I hope, he likes to see me, wearing glasses, when I get them..


When Logan came, I was in such a hurry to see him, that I forgot to wear the glasses, and left them lying, on my bedroom dresser.
When, later that night, I told Logan, about the glasses, I was so happy, when he told me he likes the look, of people wearing glasses, and is looking forward to see, how nice I will look, when I am wearing my new glasses.

Sadie, was really fascinated with the glasses, that Cindy, was wearing, she sure would sure like to try them, and see, what she would look like wearing glasses.
She, had noticed, that Cindy, was not wearing the glasses, when she left to go on her date.
When she looked in Cindy’s bedroom, there were the glasses, lying on top of her dresser, so she put them on, and looked in the mirror.
She sure, loved her glasses wearing look, and when looking around, 
realized, the prescription, was a little to strong.
She likes her glasses wearing look so much, that now, she wants to wear glasses..
She, will ask her mother, to make an appointment for her, to have an eye exam.

When, they entered, the optical store, both Sadie, and Cindy, were excited, and looking forward, to be prescribed, to wear glasses.
They were so glad to hear, the optometrist, telling them, here is your prescription, and you should wear your glasses all day.
With all the frames on display, it took them a while, to select a frame, that they really liked.
After the measurements, were taken, the optician, told them, the glasses would be ready, in about an hour.


While waiting for their glasses, they went to the food court for some refreshments, and while enjoying their treats, Cindy, told Sadie, where she had found the glasses,
Sadie, perhaps, I should check at the mall office, to see, if they have any news, about the glasses.
The girl, in the office, checked, and after a lot of questions, said, yes, here it is, somebody lost some ladies glasses, in a brown glasses case, about a week ago..
Yes, that sounds right, and I am sure, that they are the glasses I found.
Here is the phone number, of the person, who lost the glasses.


Sadie, I will have to make a phone call, I think that it might be the person, who lost her glasses.
I dialed the number, and a pleasant voiced lady answered.
After talking to her , I was sure, I had the right person, and when I told her that we were at the food court in the mall, we made arrangements to meet there.


The hour was up, and we went back to the optical store to pick up our glasses
We looked around, and in the mirror, and both of us, are so happy, with our improved vision, and our choice of frame, and how nice, we look wearing glasses.


Now happily wearing our new glasses, we sat at the table, where we are to meet the lady, who lost her glasses.
We just got settled, when a very pretty, glasses wearing lady asked me, are you Cindy ?
Yes I am, glad to meet you, my name is Alexandria, but I go by the name of Alex.
We sure had a lot lot talk about, after I had given, Alex her glasses.
She thanked me over, and over, her husband, just can’t wait, to see her wear her second pair of glasses.


On the way home, Sadie, said to me, Cindy, I think, the best thing that has happened to us was, when you found, THE LOST GLASSES
