description: Nicolas travels to meet Grace, but their first meeting is filled with insecurity, surprises, and unexpected connections.
---
My flight was awful! Cloudy skies make the plane move a lot and turbulence makes me super anxious. 

I told Grace I’d meet her in the afternoon, I wanted to be able to take a bath and rest a little.
Did I tell you I hired a girl that helps me with my personal stuff? You could say she is my assistant but I don’t like the term “assistant”, so I call her Valery.

Val took care of everything for my arrival at Utah, there was a rented car already waiting for me at the airport and a reservation for me in a Condo at Canyons Resorts. 
I wasn’t sure how many days I was staying so Val rented the superior king suite for 2 weeks, if I had to go earlier Grace could stay there as a vacation in her own city if she wanted to. 
I felt a little bit weird, I wasn’t exited like you are when you’re going out with your crush but I felt I’d developed a sort of affection for this stranger that now I knew a lot of stuff about but at the same time I wanted so bad to know a lot more… I didn’t want to think about it too much so I took a nice hot bath and I almost fell asleep right on the bath tub. I wasn’t sure which kind of plan Grace would like so I dressed simple and casually; a white shirt, blue jeans, black leather jacket and white nike blazers. I didn’t know if I was too informal but I didn’t want to be over dressed and make her uncomfortable. 
N: “Hey Grace, please send me your location and I’ll pick you up in a while”
… 20 minutes passed and there was no answer
N: “Grace? Are you there?” 
… 20 more minutes and no answer 
Had I been stood up?? I was disappointed because I sent 5 more messages and I didn’t get a reply. 
When I was about to order Indian food, I received a call. IT WAS GRACE!
N: “Hello?”
G: “Hi…” A very shy and sweet voice answered
N: “Grace? Are you ok?” 
G: “Hi Nikko, I’m sorry I didn’t answer before. I’ve been feeling so self-conscious about my looks and I don’t know if I’m ready to meet you” 
N: “But what about your looks Grace? You are a very nice girl and we are becoming friends, aren’t we?”
G: “We are, but I think I’m developing some feelings for you and I don’t know how to behave. I feel insecure and ugly. I wish I was a normal girl and maybe you could like me that way”
N: “Who said I didn’t like you?” Remember I told you I’m a people pleaser? I could not let her think I didn’t like her even if I didn’t know if I would actually feel comfortable around her
G: “Are you sure you want to go out with me?”
N: “Girl I took a flight across the country to meet you… what do you think?”
I heard her giggles and she said I was right, but she made me promise I was going to be honest and if I didn’t like her we could be friends. I got her location and I drove to pick her up. I didn’t want a driver this time because I felt it would be a little bit more “normal” to go out just the two of us. 
When I was outside her house I could see it was a regular neighborhood like the ones you see in movies, you know? Houses in the middle of a garden divided by fences… Of course this was not the way my neighborhood was, but it was ok I guess. 
I got off the car and when I was about to ring the doorbell she opened the door. 
“Nicolas! You scared me!” She yelled
“Oh my god Grace, YOU scared ME!” I said and I laughed a little
 “Well, hi Nikko… I’m Grace nice to meet you” She said while reaching out her hand
“Is that it? Give me a hug stranger” I said and I bent a little bit to hug her “I feel like we’re on this stage of our friendship, aren’t we?” I asked
She was taken by surprise a little bit and she hugged me back. I immediately noticed her HUGE and a little bit crossed eyes. I had never seen anything like that except in movies, it reminded me of Harry Potters teacher, the one with the big glasses…
“Wow Nicolas, I really like your fragrance! Is it One million by Paco Rabanne by any chance?” She said 
“That’s impressive, it is!!” I said 
“I work for a retail store and I get to smell a lot of fragrances, that one is one of my favorite ones” She replied 
Is it true that when one of your senses is weak, the others get stronger? I didn’t know if that was the case or she had a really nice nose for this… 
I figured she didn’t go in too many dates so I would make this one count, even if at the end of the night we didn’t match, she was going to have a blast so I behaved like a true gentleman. 
I opened the door for her and held her hand till she was sitting in the car; I closed the door and got myself in the car. 
I asked her if she had any particular recommendations and as I figured, she said she didn’t have any, so I called Val and she had already searched for things to do and places to visit and sent me a message with the recommendations. 
We went to “Takashi” an Asian food restaurant in Salt Lake City, it’s regularly very busy but Val got us right in.
“Are you sure you’re ok with Japanese food Grace?”
“Uhmm I’ve only tried Chinese and I liked it, so it’s a new experience and I’m ok with it” She said
I asked her if she wanted to hold my arm or my hand 
“Well I do want to, but it’s not because I can’t see… I can. Not that good, but I can. I would like to hold your hand because I like you” she said
I interlocked my fingers with hers and walked in. 
We got a nice table, a little bit more on the private side of the place and we sat in front of each other. The waiter brought the menus and I opened mine but never got to actually read it. I was mesmerized by Grace trying to read it. She moved her head up and her eyes where kinda looking down through her big glasses, her right hand held the menu and the left one held the left earpiece of the glasses. Her eyes were scrunched up and I could see them turn in and go back a little each time she blinked… WHAT A SIGHT! Suddenly my pants felt too tight and I was so very glad we were sitting, or else the bulk on them would have been too noticeable.
I could bet my life right there she still couldn’t see the menu, because she kept moving her head up but her neck back. I saw my dad doing this when he didn’t have his reading glasses on, but I never ever thought about that simple action as something exiting as I found it now.
“What if we ask the waiter for his recommendation?” I suggested
“Yeah, that’s a great idea!” Grace said. I knew her excitement came from the fact that she couldn’t see the menu and this option seemed to be the perfect fit for her
“Are you ready to order?” The waiter asked
“Sure, we’d like you to please bring us whatever you recommend” I said
“Uhmm we have special sashimis and sushi, would you like me to bring different kinds for you to try?” 
“Yes please, and I would like a Japanese whiskey, how about you Grace?” I asked
“Uhmm just a regular soda please” she said
“May I recommend a Japanese soda miss?” The waiter said
“Yes, thank you” 
My whiskey and the soda arrived almost immediately and the place was absolutely full, I had now time to concentrate in Grace.
“So… Tell me how’s this date going so far?” She asked
“Well I’ve felt really good. I feel like I know you from a long time” I said
“I know, the same thing happens to me. Who would’ve thought a stupid comment on your unintentional post would lead to such a nice friendship” She said
While she was talking all I could see was her beautiful green eyes, framed by the huge glasses which obviously had been worn too much. The way she lifted her face made me think she could only see clear from the center, and the way she still had to scrunch her eyes made me wonder how much she was actually seeing. 


My pants were still hard, and I was feeling anxious, all I wanted to do right now was to kiss her and make her mine, but I had to behave. 
“So, Grace, tell me what are you looking for in a guy?” I asked
“Well, first of all I need a man who’s not shallow. I’m obviously not a cover girl, and most guys want hot perfect girls and I will never be one of them. I do try to eat healthy, and my body is fit, but my eyes are the one thing wrecking my looks” she said in a sad voice
“What do you mean Grace? Your eyes are beautiful. Your glasses are unusual yeah, but they’re not that bad. Remember you only sent me one picture of you? Well when I saw you for the first time I realized you’re more beautiful than what you seem in pictures” I said
She blushed and looked at the table, but whenever she was trying to see something she had to lift her head. 
“Here you go: This is Crunchy Ebi, Spicy muscles with quail egg, Tuna tataki and Puff the magic dragon. Here’s soy and eel sauce and please if you need anything let me know” The waiter said
To me everything looked delicious, but Grace seemed surprised.
“Wow, this looks really fancy” She said
“I hope you like it” I said and as I grabbed the chopsticks I realized she didn’t know how to use them. I was a master and I offered my help to teach her how to use them. 
She accepted but still she had a hard time practicing and I think it was because she couldn’t see the food that well or at least that’s what it seemed. 
“Excuse me, could you bring us a pair of forks please?” I asked the waiter
Those sure made things easier for Grace and I could see she felt a little bit more comfortable since we both were using them. 
Then, all of the sudden she started to cough a little… the kind of cough that goes away when you take a sip of water… But it didn’t go away.
She cleared her throat and said “I feel something in my throat; I think I need to go to the bathroom” 
“Do you want me to go with you? Can I help you with something?” I asked, tbh I was a little worried
“Is everything ok?” The waiter asked
“She has a little something in her throat, that’s it” I said
“Oh, miss are you allergic to nuts by any chance?” The waiter asked
“Uhmm yeah, to almost every tree nut” She said
“Oh miss but our menu clearly states that one the dishes I brought contains a variety of nuts. Pecans, Macadamia nuts, peanuts… a mix of a lot of them actually” The waiter said and I could see the fear in his eyes
“Oh my god, this is bad” Grace said holding her throat
“Oh dear god, can you please call 911? We need help” I said while standing behind Graces chair and grabbing her by the shoulders “Calm down sweetie, I’m here ok?” 
The cough was each time louder and by this point everyone was watching but obviously I didn’t care. The paramedics arrived almost immediately and asked me for her information; Grace was having really hard time breathing. I told them I didn’t know a lot of things about her medical record because we were on our first date and they asked me for her insurance information; I imagine this was to select a hospital to take her to. I told them I didn’t know and I didn’t care, I asked them to take us to the nearest and best hospital around.


They placed Grace on the gurney, took her glasses off and handed them to me, I putted them in my pocket. When we were in the ambulance, they had her on oxygen and Grace kept trying hard to breath, I was so scared. 
In the hospital they took her inside and I was left in the waiting room. I called Val and told her what had happen and she asked me if I needed for her to come, but I insisted I could handle everything as long as she didn’t die. 
An hour had gone by when I realized I had her glasses, and I got them out. Now I had the time to really look at them. 
They had big bulgy lenses, they were so heavy, no wonder why Grace had red marks on her nose, maybe her facial features had actually changed because of the glasses because her nose was a little crocked, but it only made her a little bit more attractive. I putted them on and I felt immediately sick. I could see nothing at all, I felt that something was pulling my eyes and colors were merged into one big blur. 
“Grace Scott’s family?” Someone asked
“Ohhh me, I’m the boyfriend” I said, assuming it was better than saying I’m the stranger she was having dinner with 
“She is ok, she woke up 15 minutes ago and she is breathing fine. You should be extra careful; normally people with tree nuts allergies are very sensitive to everything that triggers the symptoms. She could actually die from eating a peanut, so thankfully she received help immediately but please be extremely careful next time” She advised 
“Ohh thank you, thank you so much!! I’m so glad she is ok! When can I see her?” I asked
“Right now, come with me” The young doctor said and she took me to Grace’s room
“Hey there stranger” I said
“Ohh hey” Grace said turning her head a little in my direction but her eyes were not looking at me at all. 
“How are you feeling? You had me so worried!” I said
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know that food had nuts in it. I feel so bad for ruining our date” She said
Her eyes had a vacant look, she wasn’t even scrunching her eyes but they were almost closed. It was as if they knew they were useless without glasses and they preferred to be closed.
“You didn’t ruin anything. I’m glad you are ok” I said reaching close to her and kissing her forehead
She really couldn’t see me at all cause she seemed surprised when she felt the kiss.
“Nikko, by any chance do you know if my glasses are here? Or did they fell at the restaurant? I asked a nurse and she told me they were not here and I can’t see enough to look for them. I’m embarrassed to ask this but could you help me find them?” Her sweet voice said
“Here they are sweetie, the paramedics gave them to me” I said and I held the glasses in front of her. Her hand lifted and she moved it around until she could feel the glasses, just as you imagine a blind person would do. That made me so hard again… 
We stayed the night and she insisted for me to lay in her bed but I didn’t think the doctors would like it that much, so instead I took a sit in next to her and I don’t even know when but I fell asleep. 
When I woke up lights were off, I had a blanket on me and I was holding her hand. She was sleeping and had the thingy that checks the vital signs, the IV and her glasses on. 
What a beautiful woman she was, now I really had the time to look at her beautiful features and I liked them a lot. I took her glasses off, folded the earpieces and placed them on the nightstand. What a sight… She was gorgeous! 
I sat again and I just stayed there, watching her sleeping peacefully. How many times had she gone to bed feeling insecure? How much had she struggled with life having so little vision?
She is a beautiful human being, a lovely woman and still feels like she is not enough. I felt so many things that night, but I knew right there I wanted to date this girl.
