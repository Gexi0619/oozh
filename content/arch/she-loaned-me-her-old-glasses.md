She loaned me, her old glasses.




Lisa is my name, I am going to high school this fall, and I am really looking forward to it.
This past summer, I have grown quite a bit, and I am starting to look like a women now, and I feel more grown up.
My best friend is Kelly, we have been friends for a long time, she is a pretty girl, 
but I always feel sorry for her, because she has to wear glasses.
She told me she does not mind, because, if she does not wear her glasses, she is cross eyed.
I have tried her glasses, but everything I tried to look at looks is so fuzzy , I cannot see a thing, thank goodness I have perfect eye sight.
Growing up in a musical family, I play, the violin and the piano. and getting better all the time, and now, I am looking forward to play in the high school 
orchestra.


The summer break has finished, I now, am a high school student !
It sure is a big change, so many new faces, students, from other schools, who are now in my class.
One thing, that really surprised me is, that so many of them, wear glasses, I would say, that close to half of the students wear glasses.
I also noticed, that a lot of them, are looking very attractive wearing glasses, which surprised me, I guess that will make Kelley feel good, that now,she is not one of the few who wears glasses, like at the old school.


We had the try outs for the orchestra, and the teacher complimented, me on my performance, and asked me to join the orchestra.


To day we had our first orchestra practice, and we were assigned seats, and partners to share the music scores with, because there are not enough music stands.
I now am the first violinist, Jenny is the girl who sits beside me, that I have to share the music stand with.
She is also a first year student, a very pleasant, good looking girl, and she wears glasses, like so many of the other students.
After a few practices ,with the orchestra, I noticed that I have trouble, reading the music, and asked Jenny, not to move the music stand, so far away,
Jenny, who had been wearing glasses for a few years, realized, Lisa might have a vision problem, like she used to have.


Well, I did not move the stand, Lisa, perhaps you have a vision problem.
No, I have perfect eye sight.
Lisa, who remembered, that she to had been sure, she had perfect eye sight, before she started to wear glasses, and now is sure that Lisa, is myopic, like she is., but she does not realize it.


The next practice, Jenny, had put her first pair of glasses, in her purse, she was sure, that after Lisa tried the glasses, she would realize, that she to has a vision problem.
To day when playing, Lisa made some mistakes, because she just could not see the score clearly, and asked Jenny, to place the stand closer to her, 
Lisa, I did not move the stand, I mentioned before, I think you have a vision problem, and I will prove it .
Try wearing these glasses, I had the same problem as you have, and when you wear the glasses ,you will realize it. 
The glasses are the first pair I wore, I think you will be surprised, how they improve your vision when you try them. 
I put the glasses on, and looked at the music score, and noticed right away, I could read everything now, nice and clear.
All I could say, I cannot believe it, Jenny, you are right, I have a vision problem, what am I going to do?
Lisa, you can have the glasses, and when you wear them, will realize, you need to wear glasses, then have an eye exam, and get your own glasses, with the proper prescription.
How do I look wearing glasses? 
You look good, here is a small mirror, so you can look at your self. 
I was surprised how I looked, and now, I cannot wait, to go to the wash room, to look in a big mirror, so I can have a real good look.
I wore the glasses, going to the washroom, and noticed things, I had never seen before, I could even see the end of the hall.,
I can't believe it, me needing to wear glasses.
When I looked at myself in a big mirror, kind of liked my glasses wearing look.
What, will my parents say, they want ,perfect healthy children.
I wore the glasses going home, and really enjoyed my improved vision.
As soon, as I came close to home, took the glasses off, so my parents and my brother, would not see me wearing glasses.
My parents asked how the practice went, and being honest, told them about my mistake, but that the girl who sat beside had moved the music stand, so I could not read the music.
Lisa, you seem to have some marks, on your nose, they look not right, I will look at them later, I don't want your looks spoiled.


Later that night, I went over to see Kelly.
I walked in to her room, wearing the glasses.
Lisa, I did not know you had an eye exam, and were prescribed glasses?
The glasses are not mine, so I told her the whole story. 
What did your parents say? 
I did not tell them, Kelly, you know my mother, she even noticed some indents on my nose, from wearing the glasses.
Well, Lisa, I think you look very nice wearing glasses, I would not worry about it.
Yes, I kind of like the glasses wearing look, I sure like to get my own.


I started to wear the glasses at school, and enjoyed my improved vision, nobody made any comment, which made me feel better.
I now have a hard time, remembering to take the glasses off, before I get home, and to make sure mother, will not notice any indents on my nose.


The following Saturday, my mother and I went shopping at the mall, and I wanted to go into the optical store, to look around, but my mother would not let me, I had no business, looking at glasses .




I was so used to wearing the glasses at school, and at night in my room, doing home work, that I started to miss the glasses, when not wearing them.
To night, wearing the glasses, while I was very busy, writing a thousand word essay, my brother Jimmie walked into my room, he looked at me, and yelled, mom, you come and see this, Lisa, is wearing glasses.
My secret is gone, mother came into my room, what is this all about?
She looked at me, where did you get the glasses? 
Take the stupid things off, and you better come down, so your father can hear your story to.
So down we went, I kept wearing the glasses, my mother looked at me, and told me, to take the silly things off my face.
My dad, looked at me, and said, Lisa you look nice wearing glasses, where did you get them?
After telling them, the whole story, my dad said, we better arrange for an eye exam for you, and my mother said, I am sure, they will tell you you don't need glasses.
Now I realize, where those marks on your nose came from.
My dad said, I am not so sure, to day one of my co-workers, told me that his daughter brought home a note from the teacher, who suggested his daughter have a eye exam, and she wears glasses now,
I suggest you make an appointment for an eye exam, and for Jimmie to.
The next day, I wore the glasses going to school, and did not take them off, when I came home.
My mother told me, take the glasses off, and also, that she had made an appointment for me, for an eye exam, and that her dad had wanted, for Jimmie to have an eye examine to.


The day of the eye exam, my mother was in a fighting mood, her kids vision was perfect, they never had complained about it.
My mother, went into the examination room, when my brother had his eyes examined,
She, had never had an eye exam herself, so had no idea what went on.
After the first part of the exam was finished, the doctor told her, that my Jimmie's eyes were healthy, mother said well I knew that, he does not need to wear glasses,


We will test his vision next, and then the doctor, put what looked like a pair of oversized glasses, in front of him, and asked my brother to read the letters on the different lines., first with his left , then with his right eye, my mother told the doctor, those letters are way too small too small, how do you expect him, to read them?
What are those clicks, I hear?


Well, I am sorry to say, that your son, is myopic, and should be wearing glasses at school, and when watching T.V., he does not have to wear them all the time, unless he wants to, he will be wearing glasses all the time, in another year. 
My mother was stunned, when she came back into the reception area with the doctor, who handed the optician, my brothers prescription.


The doctor asked me, to follow him into the examination room.
I told him, how I had found out, that I needed glasses, and showed him Jenny's glasses.
He checked the prescription, and then started the exam, after asking Kelley, I had some idea, how the exam went, and now was really looking forward, to get my own glasses
While waiting for the exam, I had with the help of the optician, had found a glasses frame, I loved.
When my exam was finished, the doctor told me, that my friend had been right,
I need to wear glasses all the time, and your prescription, is a half diopter stronger then the glasses, she loaned you.
My prescription read left eye - 1.25. right eye - 1.50, I am all excited, I will be wearing glasses now.


My mother approved of my choice of frame, and my brother is all excited, he likes the way he looks . wearing glasses, he thinks he looks more grown up,
A couple of hours later, my mother went home, with both her children wearing glasses, she was not very happy.


When my dad came home, told my Jimmie and me, that we looked very nice, and really liked, our glasses wearing look , and that he had expected, we would be prescribed glasses, his co-workers have told him, that most of their children are wearing glasses .


Jimmie was so excited, he was telling everyone that he could see things now, he could not see before, and even talked my mother into trying his glasses.
I could not believe that she would try the glasses, and when she tried them, told us that she could not believe, how she can see things now, and after trying mine , who are too strong for, tried Jenny's glasses, and now realizes she needs to wear glasses.


My dad suggested that, both needed an eye exam.


Well, both my dad and mother, are wearing glasses now.
My mother, even got two different frames, and wears her glasses all the time, she is a low myopic, and seems quite proud of her glasses. 
My dad was prescribed reading glasses. and I think they both look beautiful wearing glasses,


Next orchestra practice, I will give Jenny her glasses back, and thank her, because of her, I would never have realized, I needed to wear glasses., and that the rest of the family of the family, are now wearing glasses, thanks to her loaner glasses.
