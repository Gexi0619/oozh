If you like a guy to notice you, start wearing glasses 


I am madly in love with Jeff the quarterback of our high school football team.
The problem is that he does not know it.
Jeff and my brother Logan are friends, Jeff is at our house quite often and is very nice to me,
but that is all.
Yesterday I heard them talk about the date they had with Kate and Jenny.
I can t believe it, they are very average looking girls and they both wear glasses, they should be able to get better looking girls.


When the doorbell rang, I opened the door and there was Jeff wearing glasses.
Well Megan how do you like my new glasses?
I could not believe my eyes Jeff looked fantastic wearing glasses.
Before I could answer him, my brother showed up.
I see that you got your new glasses, boy you look great.
Yes they came in the mail to day, the prescription is -0.75. 
I will wear these for a while and then I have another pair with a stronger prescription.
At last I am wearing glasses like I always wanted, I love wearing them, 
My brother asked Jeff if he could try them.
When Logan put the glasses on he looked so studious. 
I could not believe glasses could improve looks so much.
That was all I heard, because they went to Logan s room.

I sat down to do some reading, but could not concentrate.
Jeff is so happy that he is wearing glasses now.
How good both guys looked wearing glasses.
Dating girls who wear glasses, what is so special about wearing glasses.
I am all confused.

My friend Kim came over to see me.
I told her all about Jeff wearing glasses and how he likes to wear them.
How good my brother looked when he tried the glasses, and them dating girls who wear glasses.
What is going on?
Well my sister has started to wear glasses, she looks good, and likes wearing them.
I love the looks of guys wearing glasses, and would not mind if I had to wear glasses.
Glasses are a fashion item now and a lot of guys prefer girls who wear glasses.
Then we talked about school and other things.

A couple of months later, Kim phoned me and asked me to go to the mall with her.
Since I was home alone loved the opportunity to go out.
I went to the bathroom to do my hair and some make up, when I noticed a pair of gasses on the counter.
Where did the glasses come from?
Nobody in our house wears glasses.
I picked the glasses up and looked at them.
Now I realized they looked like the glasses that Jeff wore.
I could not resist it, but had to try the glasses.
When I put them on, noticed right away how nice the glasses felt.
I looked in the mirror and was surprised, I loved the looks of my eyes behind the lenses.
The frame looked looked not bad, a little to masculine.
When I looked around and was surprised how well I could see.
I went over to the window and everything I looked at, looked  so nice and clear.
When I took the glasses off and then put them on again noticed everything looked sharper and more defined when wearing the glasses.
What a surprise, do I need to wear glasses?â€‹
The doorbell rang and I went downstairs to let Kim in.
When I opened the door and said hello to Kim.
I did not know you wore glasses, I sure like your new look.
Now I realized, that I had forgotten to take the glasses off, they were so comfortable and I could see so well.
I told Kim about the glasses, and how well I could see wearing them.
Well I guess you need an eye exam and wear glasses, no big deal, with your looks, and the right frame you will look fantastic.
I put the glasses where I found them, and make sure to ask my brother about them.

When we were at the mall, and after Kim bought a blouse that sh wanted, we went to the food court.
While we enjoyed some refreshments, Kim suggested since we had nothing else to do, and I am sure you need to wear glasses, we should go to the optical store and try some frames, and see how you look wearing glasses.
In the optical store, Kim told the optician that I was looking for a nice frame.
The optician looked at my face and said, it will be easy to find you a frame that you will be very happy with.
After trying a number of frames we found one that looked fantastic.
I could not believe I could look so good wearing glasses.
Kim tried some frames and she looks adorable wearing glasses.
Now. I think I am looking forward to wear glasses. 
I wonder what kind of reaction I will get from Jeff, when he sees me wearing glasses.
Now I know I know for sure, I want to wear glasses.

When I saw my brother I asked him about the glasses.
You are not supposed to know about that.
Well what is the story?
These are Jeff s first glasses, he now wears a stronger prescription in his new glasses.
He gave me his old glasses so I can wear glasses, and hope they might change my vision.  
As soon I can see properly wearing the glasses, I want  to wearglasses full time, I like wearing glasses.
Now I knew, we both like to wear glasses.


The following Monday after school I told my mother, I think I have a vision problem and
perhaps should have an eye exam. 
She told me to make an appointment for me and my brother, which I did.
Now I am all excited and can t wait to get my glasses.
When my mother told my brother that he had an appointment for an eye exam, he asked why.
Well your sister thinks she has a vision problem and I think you should have an eye exam to.

My brother and I went to the optical store for our eye appointment.

The optician remembered me, and gave me some paperwork to fill out.
I found the exam very interesting, and was so happy when the optometrist suggested   
I should wear glasses full time.
My prescription read -1.00 for the right and -1.25 for the left eye.
Selecting a frame was easy and after some measurements was told the glasses would be ready in a couple of hours.
When my brothers exam was finished he came out smiling,
His prescription read -0,75 for the right and -0,50 for the left eye and some astigmatism.
I helped him select a frame, I really enjoyed myself.

We went to the food court and had some refreshments while two very excited persons were waiting for their glasses to be ready.
Thank you Megan, for arranging the eye exam.
Thanks to you I will be wearing glasses sooner than I expected.
Logan, promise me, that you won t tell Jeff that I wear glasses now.

When we picked up our glasses, they were ready.
Logan was first, he was all smiles when he looked in the mirror, I must say he looked fantastic.
When I put my glasses on and looked around could not believe the improvement in my vision.
I was so happy with my new look, and can t wait for Jeff to see me.
When we came home, my mother was really surprised,  that both of us needed to wear glasses.
She complimented both of us on how nice we looked wearing glasses.
I spend some time trying my make up, and just love my new look.

Logan told me Jeff would be coming over, and we arranged I would let him in.
I was all exited when the doorbell rang.
I opened the door, hello Jeff.
The reaction of Jeff seeing me wearing glasses was. priceless.
After he came in and found his tongue said, Megan you look beautiful.
Are you a glasses wearer now, or are you teasing me?
Jeff these are my new prescription glasses, and I will be wearing glasses all the time now.
Then my brother came.
You are wearing glasses to, what happened?
We sat down in the living room and told Jeff all about it.
Before Jeff left that night he asked me for a date.

Jeff and I are seeing a lot of each other, and are looking forward to the future.
We love each other, we love wearing glasses.
On thing I know for sure now.
If you like a guy to notice you, start wearing glasses.
