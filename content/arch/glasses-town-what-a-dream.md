description: Young couple Jim and Kim win the lottery and use the money to build a dream community called Glasses Town.
---
While my wife was shopping at the mall, I was sitting in the food court watching girls wearing glasses.
I had a great afternoon, and could not quit thinking about all the nice sightings.
When I went to sleep that night I was dreaming about it

Jim is in his last year of university, studying optometry.
He is looking forward to graduating  to start working in his chosen profession and make some money , so he can get married to his high school sweetheart Kim
Kim is a beautiful ,auburn haired girl , who proudly wears her glasses for her - 4.00 myopia., ,
She is a very smart ambitious girl looking forward to getting married.
At university she studied planning and development, and now works at an architects office.

The happy day came and Jim and Kim got married ;
They were a beautiful couple wearing their new glasses.
They moved into Kim s apartment , while saving for a new house , so they could start a family.
They were a happy couple dreaming of an exciting future.

Kim was in the habit of buying a few lottery tickets every week , always dreaming of winning enough to buy a new car or even a house.
Sometimes a dream comes true , and this time it did.
She won the super ball lottery , the big prize 125 million dollars.

They spend many long hours trying to figure the best way to use all that money , without wasting it, and at the same time be
useful to their community and also get some enjoyment out of it.
Kim came up with the idea that they should invest in land , and build a new community.
Something very different and special, to give young people a chance to get their own home.

There were some nice scenic properties about 10 miles from the city, in a area not well suited for agriculture but great for development, and not to far away from the big city for easy commuting.
They went to investigate , and talked to local authorities , and after receiving their O.K. bought enough acreage to build a small town.
They decided that they would build very affordable family homes , either to rent with the option to buy , or to buy outright, at a very reasonable price.
They would build a mall to make the town self sufficient, and Jim could have his optical shop there.
There would be a new school and park complete with playground and a swimming pool.
Also they planned on building a seniors home so the grandparents were close by.
This was going to be a dream community for young singles or couples with young families.

Because both Kim and Jim enjoyed wearing glasses  , and loved the looks of people wearing glasses , would name it GLASSES TOWN
Then they discussed who they would like to have live in their town, and established some rules and regulations.

Only persons wearing prescription glasses, full time, could live in their town, contact lenses were not allowed.
All children had to have an eye exam no later than age 6, and all would be prescribed free glasses, with a prescription 
of  -50 or + 50 depending on the child s need, they all had to wear them full time.
For younger children , under 6 , who wanted to wear glasses to be like everybody else , frames with non prescription lenses would be available free of charge.

Construction of the town started soon after .
They opened an inquire and sales office.
With all the publicity they had received , were very busy with inquires
They were surprised  that only a few people objected to having to wear glasses.
The applicants who did not wear glasses ,went to Jim s office to get an eye exam and a prescription.
The first phase of houses soon were finished , and families started to move in.
The mall  and second phase were well on its way toward completion.
Because the school was not finished yet, all the school age children had to be taken by bus to a neighboring school.
They did not get any teasing about wearing glasses , or for living in GLASSES TOWN, matter a fact a lot of other students were wishing they had glasses 
At the end of summer the school and park were finished ,so there was no more need for a school bus.
The mall was completely finished  and all the stores were now open, 
The last of the houses and the senior center were now finished 
In a small industrial park was a new eye glasses factory where they designed and fabricated glasses,
.

Jim and Kim were delighted how well everything had fallen into place .
The one thing they had not thought about was visitors , they might not be wearing glasses.
They decided that since there was only one main road running into town , they would build an information center .
Everybody coming into GLASSES TOWN had to check in, and if they did not wear glasses, could borrow a pair of non prescription glasses so they looked as if they belonged.

Everybody in GLASSES TOWN was happy, they proudly wore their glasses 
When Kim and Jim went for a walk with their glasses wearing twins, were delighted when people would come over and thank them for the opportunity to live in this great community.
Then I woke up, was back in the real world , went to the bathroom , and back to sleep , sorry no more dreams.
