The little box




Growing up, in a small town, when you are a 12 year old boy, is a great experience.
With so many farms around, there is always, something going on.
Farmers, making trips to he general store, or the feed mill, to get chicken feed,, after they have dropped their eggs off, at the grading station.
During the summer break, from school, you have lots of time, to jump on your bike and look around, to see if, some body might need some help., that gives you something to do.
We now, have a drug store in town, next to the doctors office.
When, I was in the drugstore, looking around, the druggist, asked me, if I wanted to make some money.
I, sure do,.
Well, do you know where the Gibson farm is?
Yes, I do,
I will, give you 25 cents, if you can deliver, this little, package, for me to Mr. Gibson. 
So, I jumped on my bike, and went to the Gibson farm.


A young, glasses wearing girl, I remember, from seeing at school, opened the door.
She took the package, and after she gave me the money, I went back to town.
While riding along, I wondered, why, all the Gibson children, are wearing glasses.
I like, the look of glasses, but how do you get them?
I went back to the drugstore, gave the owner his money, and he paid me, and asked me to check, every day at the store, to check, if there were more deliveries.


I now make some money, and I put the money, in my piggy bank, so I can use it, when I need it..


Mr. Gibson, died, and the farm was sold, and there is, going to be an auction sale.
I love auction sales, all the house hold goods, and odds and ends, from the implement shed, and all other small items are always on the wagon,.
You can browse, through all the items, on the wagon, to see, if there is anything , you might want to buy.


At, the Gibson sale day, when looking, at all the stuff on the wagon, I spotted a little box, with pencils, and other school stuff, that might come in handy, when school starts again.
The auctioneer, Mr. Jones, always sold the items, on the wagon first, and I kept my eye on that little box.


After selling, a number of items, I heard him say, I, have a little box here, with some school stuff, any body give me a dollar, for this box?
No bidders, 
How about 50 cents for the box,50 cents, , I put up my hand, and he said, sold, to Billy James, and handed me the box, after I had paid his helper.
On the way home, I glanced, at my purchase, and could not wait to get home, to check my treasure.


I went to my bedroom, put the box on my bed, and started unpacking it, on top was a lot of good school stuff, then I noticed some glasses cases.
There were, four glasses cases. I opened the first one and there was a nice looking, metal frame, pair of glasses, I looked them over, the lenses did not have any scratches on them, and looked like plain glass.
Slowly, I put the glasses on, and looked around.
Was it my imagination, everything, I looked at looked at, looked more defined, and clear.
Still wearing the glasses, I checked the other glasses case, and the glasses in that case, I remember, Jacob wearing, before he got his last pair of glasses..
After, looking at everything in the box, I was happy with my purchase, now I have some real glasses, that I can wear.


I liked, wearing the first pair of glasses, I could see perfect when wearing the glasses. they seem to improve my vision, and I started wearing them, every chance I had, 
Wearing the glasses, made me feel important, and I sure liked wearing them.
When school started again, I wore the glasses all the time, while I was at school, and all the students, think I have to wear glasses.


I like wearing the glasses, but I do not think, that my parents, will approve


Now, I am starting to wear the higher prescription glasses., and can see almost perfect wearing them, now, I wear the stronger glasses, as much as I can
.I like the feel, of the glasses on my face, and enjoy my improved vision..


I have been wearing the glasses, for a while now, and I am getting, so used to wearing the glasses, that my vision, sure is not very good, when, I am not wearing my glasses.


I have started, to go to high school, and we have to ride the bus, to the next town, where the high school is.
Now, I put my glasses on, as soon as I get on the bus, and do not take the glasses off, till I get home..


My mother noticed, that when I am reading a book, I am holding, the book close to my face, and she remarked on it,.
Billy, do you have a vision problem?
I, don’t know for sure, perhaps I have.
Well, I think, you do, and I will have to arrange, to have your vision checked,


On the bus, riding to school, with me, is Mandy, who, usually sits close to where I sit.
After I got of the bus at school, Mandy, asked me, what I did with, the glasses, I had been wearing before ?
Why?
Well, I would like to wear glasses, and I really, liked the looks of your old pair, of glasses.
Sure, you can have them, I will give you the glasses to morrow, when we get on the bus.


The next, day, I gave Mandy, the glasses, and after she put the glasses on, told me she can see everything, nice and clear now, and she loves the glasses, and wears them all the time .


I had my eye exam, and I was prescribed to wear glasses.
When, my new glasses, were ready, and I put them on, noticed, they were stronger, than the last pair, I had been wearing.
It took me, a couple of days, to get used to the stronger prescription, but now like wearing them, because. the lenses definitely look stronger, and even show some rings.


Mandy, is now my girlfriend, and I gave her, the stronger glasses, I had been wearing, before, I got my new glasses.
Mandy, loves, wearing the stronger prescription glasses, and wears them all the time, and I think, she looks great, wearing glasses.


Mandy, told me to day, that she has been wearing her glasses full time, even, at home. 
My parents, think it is great, that they don’t have to buy, me new glasses.


I now, know more, about glasses and vision, and now know, that my myopia prescription, is almost – 5.00.
Yes, I still like wearing glasses, and so does Mandy, the stronger the better.


Both, Mandy, and I, have received our high school diploma.
To get a job, we moved to the city, and rented a small apartment., and are living together.


I had another eye exam, and my myopia, increased to – 5,.50 , and decided to order my glasses on line, and added an extra diopter on my prescription.
I ordered two pair, because, I know, that Mandy will also, want to wear stronger glasses ,
When th glasses came in, and I started to wear them, was surprised how well I could see.
As I had expected, Mandy, is now wearing the second pair, that I had ordered.
She is worse than, I am, she wants to wear, very high prescription glasses, and has no problem, wearing the – 6.50 glasses


I got a real surprise, when I came home from work to night, and saw, that Mandy, was wearing new glasses, the prescription, I found out was – 10.50. 
She looks fantastic wearing the glasses,,I sure liked the look of the lenses.
My next surprise, was when Mandy, handed me glasses case, with glasses , with the same prescription as hers, for me to wear.
It took me a while, before my vision, wearing those strong glasses, was normal.


Because both of us, are getting older now, we noticed, that when going with a stronger prescription, it takes longer, for your vision, to be perfect again. 
Now, we are wondering, should we try to increase our prescriptions, some more.


It is winter, and there is lots of snow, on the hills, so we have ideal conditions to go snow boarding.
We had a great time, going down the hill at full speed, when we collided, and fell face first, into a snowbank.
When we tried to get up, realized, our glasses were gone, now what?
Our vision, without glasses, sure was not good, everything we looked at was so fuzzy, and with brightness, of the sun on the snow, we certainly had a hard time to see..
Where were our glasses? 
We started digging, with our hands, at the spot, that we thought our glasses were, but no luck.
A couple of other snow boarders, who had noticed us, digging in the snow, came over to
see if we needed any help.
We told them, we had lost our glasses, and tried to find them.
Well there is a pair, right here, and they handed me the glasses, but when I put them on realized they were Mandy’s glasses, and I gave her the glasses, so she could look for my glasses.
No luck, we could not find my glasses, so I had to go home, and find another pair to wear, so I could see properly. 
That night I told Mandy, I did not care what she did, but I did not want ,to wear stronger glasses, I don’t like being blind,
Well, said Mandy, I am going to try stronger, prescription glasses, I love the looks and the vision I have wearing a stronger prescription.
I still like wearing glasses, and love to look at Mandy, wearing her strong prescription glasses, and, it all happened, because, I bought the little box.
