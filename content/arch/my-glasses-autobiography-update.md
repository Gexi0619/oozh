description: A year of ups and downs, glasses, a cheating husband, new frames, and finding confidence again. Life goes on.
---
It's been a year since I wrote about my vision and glasses. A lot has happened in my life since then but I am still working at the library and have had a new pair of glasses with a very slight change in the prescription (they are now -22.00 and -23.00) . Anyhow, I like the way these glasses look. They have little discs in the lenses, as I used to have a few years back, and I see well enough with them except for reading, but I get some extra help for that using various magnifiers (reading is hard for me because of the retinal scars which mean I have lousy central vision). In other words, I'm doing fine. My glasses are extremely strong but they let me see as well as I can. My new frames are black plastic Ray-Bans and I think they look pretty cute considering how strong the lenses are. My eye doctor thinks my eyes should stabilize now, which is nice as it means I can afford to get one or two different pairs in the same prescription, which I plan to do. 

Personal life, not so good. My little boy is growing up fast, he's doing great, and he's starting at kindergarten in September. Everything was going so well, but really it wasn't. Sadly my marriage hasn't worked out. I thought my husband was working away from home a lot, but I found out that he was having an affair with another woman, and he's now left me - and his child - for her. It turns out I know this girl as we were at high school together - she's quite chubby, wears glasses nearly as strong as mine and is also slightly deaf - not that I want to sound bitter about this. What the hell. Anyway, I am on my own, only not completely, as a girlfriend of mine (who is single) is now sharing the house with me and my little boy. That works out nicely: she is a very good friend and it's great to have some adult company as well as a toddler! Also she can drive (which I can't because of my vision), so that's really useful too. After my pregnancy, I started to exercise a little more, and I've now got my figure back and (I'm told) looking good (as I said in my last post, I'm Latina, so I am quite naturally curvy). Despite everything that's happened, I still want to look as good as I can. Obviously I'm incredibly sad about my marriage and for a few months I was heartbroken, but my girlfriend and other friends helped me through that time, and I'm starting to get some confidence back now - though it's a slow process. That's the story up to date, and I'm hoping things will start to go better again before too long (and now I'm rambling).
