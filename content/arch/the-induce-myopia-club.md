The to induce myopia club


I walked into the office of an insurance company .
A very pleasant voice asked me , can I help you?
Yes please, I am here for a job interview with Miss Smith, my name is Ashley Jones.
I will let her know you are here, have a seat please.
Miss Smith came and asked me to follow her , we walked through a large office .
What I noticed more than anything else was ,that almost everyone working in that office wore glasses.
I had the interview and was told I would be notified in the next couple of days,

Walking home I remember somebody telling me that if you wear eyeglasses ,going for an interview your chances of getting the job are much better.
Looking at all those people in that office wearing glasses ,perhaps that is true.
I do not wear glasses , what am I going to do ?
I  always liked the looks of glasses , but never had an eye exam or a vision problem.
When I walked past a second hand shop, I noticed a box of eyeglasses in the window.
I went into the store , and asked if I could have a look at the glasses.
The young lady who looked after me wore very interesting glasses , that made her eyes look a little smaller, but very attractive.
She asked me if the glasses were for me .
I  told her ,I would like to find a pair of ladies , low prescription glasses.
Well, I can suggest these , and handed me a pair of eyeglasses.
If you like to try them and see how they look ,here is a mirror.
I put the glasses on and looked at myself , what a surprise , I looked pretty good wearing glasses.
When I walked over to the window and looked out got a real surprise.
It was like a whole new world, I could read signs across the street, and everything I looked at was clear and well defined.
I could not believe how much better my vision was when wearing the glasses.
Walking back to the mirror , I had another good look at myself.
I really liked my look wearing glasses.
Most important was ,that the lenses showed that they were prescription glasses , I certainly was not going to wear fake glasses.
I asked the girl for the price , after she told me , I told her I would take them.
She  told me that they were her old glasses ,and put the prescription for the glasses in a  case ,which I put in my purse , I wore the glasses walking out of the store.
When walking down the street wearing my new glasses, was thrilled  how well I could see ,and also noticed the glasses were surprisingly comfortable to wear.
I must have needed glasses and did not know it.
When I got back to my apartment , went to the bathroom and had another good look at myself.
I tried some  different types of make up , and  after a while , really liked the way I looked .
To bad I did not have the glasses when I went for the interview, well I now have glasses to wear for
the next one.
When I took the glasses off ,  noticed my distance vision was  fuzzy, and as soon as I put the glasses back on everything looked nice and clear again. 
About an hour later I received a phone call form Miss Smith ,asking me to come back to the office in the afternoon.
When I saw Miss Smith again , I was wearing my glasses , she looked at me with a big approving smile, Ashley the job is yours , can you start to morrow.?

Working in a large office you meet many different types of people.
Usually when you sit by yourself in the lunch room, somebody will come and sit with you.
To day a cute red haired , glasses wearing girl joined me .
Her name is Kelley.
She complimented me on how nice I looked wearing glasses, and asked me how long I had been wearing glasses.
When I told her how I started to wear glasses , she laughed , you made a good investment, I am sure wearing glasses got you your job.
Do you like wearing glasses? 
Yes , I like wearing them, I can see so much better now, and like my new look.
I complimented Kelley on how nice she looked wearing glasses , your prescription looks quite a bit stronger than mine, I like the looks of your eyes behind the lenses.
My prescription is now up to – 3.75., we are trying to get it up to – 5.00.
How do you do that ?
We have a kind of a club of some friends who all are trying to wear stronger glasses, they call it induced myopia.
My boy friend is an optician, and of course knows a lot about lenses and prescriptions.
Once you have had a proper eye exam, and you have your prescription , he orders glasses on line and increases your prescription , depending on how strong a  prescription you want to wear. 
When you are really comfortable wearing your stronger prescription , you can increase the prescription again if you want to.
I asked her why you would want to increase you prescription?
Well we like it that when you take your glasses off everything looks very fuzzy , and when you put your glasses back on, having that fantastic vision again.
We think the stronger lenses make your glasses more attractive to look at.
If you are interested to come when we get together, let me know.
I went back to work, wondering why would people want to wear real strong glasses.

A couple of weeks later, when I had lunch with Kelly again, asked her if I could come to their glasses club s get together.
I like wearing glasses,  but I certainly would like to know more about glasses.
She told me that I was welcome to come Friday night at her place and meet with them.
I took the prescription I had for the glasses with me .
Logan, the optician looked at it and explained to me what the numbers meant.
The glasses I am wearing are -1.25 for the right and – 1.50 for the left eye., no astigmatism.
He asked me if I wanted to increase the prescription.
We have some glasses here with different prescriptions, you can try them and see how well you can see wearing them, and if you like the look of the stronger lenses.
It was a lot of fun to try all the different lenses.
When wearing the stronger lenses, I noticed it gives you a very exciting feeling.
I am fascinated how the stronger lenses change your appearance , I think I like that look.
When it was time to go home I realized, I now know a little bit more about glasses. 
Inducing myopia and wearing stronger lenses, sure gave me something to think about.


A couple of months later , when I walked past the second hand shop, something made me go in.
The girl who had sold me my glasses , smiled and I noticed she was wearing different glasses now.
Hi, how are you getting along with your  glasses?
I like them very much and wear them all the time .
Would you like a new, little stronger pair ? 
I just got a new pair of glasses with a stronger prescription, and have my old ones for sale now.
Here they are,  you can to try them?
She handed me the glasses, I looked them over. 
I sure liked the frame, the right color and shape for me.
The lenses looked quite a bit stronger than in my present glasses
I put the glasses on,  looked around and got a very arousing, wonderful feeling.
When I walked over to the window to look out , noticed everything looked very clear and more defined. 
I was really surprised that I could see so well wearing the stronger prescription. 
Looking at myself in the mirror, loved the look of the frame with the stronger lenses.
I asked Jenny, if she is trying to increase her glasses prescription.
Jenny told me she is, when she gets used to her new prescription, she orders new glasses with a little  stronger prescription.
I told her about the glasses club. 
She asked me if I could take her to one of their meetings.
Jenny, I will ask them and let you know, and yes I like to buy the glasses.

The next day at work, Kelley noticed my new glasses right away.
When we got together at lunch she said , Ashley you look fantastic , I love your new glasses .
Where did you get them? 
The same place where I got my last pair.
Jenny, who sold them to me would like very much to come to a glasses club get together . 
She is trying to increase her prescription, and these are her old glasses.
Tell Jenny she is welcome to come, we get together again a week form Friday.

Wearing the stronger glasses now , and being able to see so well,  realized I must have been quite  myopic, and needed to wear glasses
Since I have insurance now to pay for an eye exam and glasses, I made an appointment to have my eyes examined and find out my proper prescription.
When I went for the exam. I wore my old glasses.
When the exam was finished the optometrist told me I had quite an increase, and my new prescription reads, - 2.75 for the right and -3.00 for the left eye, and no astigmatism.
This is the prescription I am wearing now , no wonder I can see so well.
Since the insurance was paying, I decided to get a second pair of glasses in the same prescription .
I really enjoyed selecting a nice new frame, and it will be fun to be able to wear different looking frames.


When I was talking to my family at home ,  told them that I was wearing glasses now.
My mother told me she is very happy, that I have a good job and able to look after myself properly.
She asked if I would mind if my younger sister who just finished high school ,come to the city and live with me while she tries to get a job.
I told her Lisa was welcome to come, and I would help her all I could.
About two weeks later Lisa moved in.
When she saw me said, Ashley I love your new look ,you look fantastic wearing glasses.  
How did you find out that you needed to wear glasses?
When I told her the story, she could not believe it .
I showed  Lisa my first pair of glasses .
Lisa put the glasses on, looked around .
When she walked around and looked out of the widow said I can t believe it, everything I look at is so nice and clear, its unbelievable, I can t remember ever being able to see so well.
Can I have the glasses ?
I think I would like to wear them.
I realized Lisa might be myopic  like I am ,and not know it. 
If you can see better wearing the glasses ,you can have them, that is how I found out I needed to wear glasses.
Lisa is now wearing the glasses, and loves  wearing them.
When she applied for a job at a law office , was hired .
The lawyer told her he was impressed with her good school marks, and her mature look.


Jenny and Lisa went with me to the next glasses club get together at Kelley s place.
When I asked her, Jenny told me her prescription is up to -4.50 now. 
She had a great time with Logan discussing prescriptions, and trying glasses..
Lisa enjoyed trying  the different glasses , and told me how she loves the looks of the stronger lenses.
I have decided that I like my current prescription , and I am not changing unless the optometrist changes my current prescription.
Lisa is all excited now, she told me that Logan thought, because of her age, she might be able to increase her prescription quite a bit.

A little while later, I noticed Lisa starting to wear my spare glasses with the stronger prescription whenever she got a chance.
She had a few dates, and then always wore my spare glasses.
Not long after, she mentioned to me, that  she can see better now with my glasses than with the ones she had been wearing.
So I gave her the glasses, realizing she most likely needed that stronger prescription the same as I did.

Lisa started to talk about wanting to increase her glasses prescription .
I suggested she first have  a proper eye exam , to find out her current prescription.
She agreed.
Lisa was very excited when the optometrist told her that her new prescription is -3.50 for the right and 
-3.75 for the left eye, and some astigmatism. 
Quite an increase of the prescription you are wearing right now.
At your age I expect you might have another increase at next years exam.
When Lisa got her new glasses and she let me try them , they were too strong for me.
Lisa loves her new stronger glasses and told me she like to talk to Logan about another increase.
I mentioned to her , that the optometrist had told her she most likely would get another increase next year, why don t you wait.,
When your glasses are to strong you are going to be blind , when you are not wearing them.
Lisa agreed , she was going to wait .


Kelley at lunchtime was all smiles.
She showed me her beautiful engagement ring.
Logan asked me to marry him, he has a new job and we are moving. 
Sorry no more glasses club meetings.
So I told her that both Lisa and I have decided we are not going to induce myopia.
The only increase , if we need one, will be when we have our annual eye exam.

About a year later when we went for our eye exam, the optometrist told me I did not need a change in my prescription.
Lisa s prescription went up ¼ diopter on each eye. 
We both had a great time selecting new frames .
We don t need a club, we both  have natural increased myopia .
Yes we are very happy ,to be good looking glasses wearing girls.,
