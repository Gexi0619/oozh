I used the word MY for the first time 



“Good morning Miss can I help you

“Yes I see you are looking for a sales assistant”

“Yes that's correct,what experience do you have”

“I was a customer service operator with a major bank but many of us were made redundant”

“So have you ever worked in retailing”

“No but I'm used to talking to customers”

“We normally prefer,somebody that has working in a optical store and knows something about glasses”

“Do you wear glasses or contact”

“No”

“I'm sorry but you have no experience, also we prefer staff that need to wear glasses as it helps the customer feel more relaxed and understands the problem, that sometimes people may have with glasses”

“I have never had my eyes tested,so maybe I need glasses,I don't mind wearing them even if I dont need them,I really need a job”

 “Ok miss let's test your eyes and see what they are like”

He sat me Infront of the machines, then he put the test frames on me.

I was so desperate to get the job that after I had read the first 4 lines I pretended  it was difficult to read the next lines,so he kept putting different lenses in, I have a good memory so I could remember the next 3 lines so as he added more lens I said that was clearer, even thought it got harder each time to read the letters. Then he changed the black lens, while he was doing I quickly learnt an extra line.

He smiled at me.

“Are you sure you really want the job it means you will have to wear glasses ,they are rather a strong prescription for a first pair,your left eye is worse than your right eye I'm surprised you have not had glasses before”

Why was he smiling at me so much?

“We will make you a free pair of glasses,we have some discontinued styles and I will use C39 lens to save costs incase you don't like wearing glasses and want to leave”

“If you come back in about an hour they will be ready for you”

An hour later I returned. What had I done? Why were the lenses so much thicker than all the glasses on the display shelves?
As he placed them on my face everything became a blur.

“How are they miss, can you see better now”

He was smiling again.

“Yes thank you they are much better”

He then took them off my face and placed them in a case.

“I suggest you wear them at home first before going outside they will take a few days to get used to wearing them”

He smiled again 

“See you next Monday at 8 30”

As soon as I got home I took the glasses out of their case,what had I done, how was I ever going to see wearing them,and the lens looked so thick,but he did say it would take a few days to get used to them,so better start now.

I turned the TV on and sat down in the chair and placed the thick heavy glasses on my face. The TV was just a blur.I kept screwing my eyes up to try to see things.
I must have fallen asleep, the room was dark and the TV had turned off to sleep mode.
I carefully felt my way to the bedroom.
Next morning when I woke I still had the glasses on,strangely things nearer to me  looked a little clearer but still everything on the other side of the room was just a fog
The next 3 days I kept the glasses on day and night, when I took them off to wash my face I kept my eyes closed.
When I woke on day 4 things on the other side of the room looked a little clearer now so I decided to go out for a walk and a coffee.
It was difficult to see but I managed to find my way to the coffee shop.
I heard a voice say good morning Miss I looked up and screwed my eyes tightly it was the eye doctor.

“Can I join you.He pulled the chair a little closer to me and smiled again”
“How are you managing with your glasses, you look very pretty wearing them”.

“Thank you Sir,It took me a few days to get used to them they felt rather heavy, but I can see so much better now thank you”

Well that was true,for the first 2 days I could see nothing but now at least I could see across the table.

It's day 7 now and on my way to work,I'm surprised how far I can see now, I was determined to get used to them I have kept my eyes closed when I take the glasses  off to shower or wash my hair ,

“Good morning Miss Elizebeth,you look very professional,, your glasses look very nice on you, I think they need a little adjusting, sit there while I take them down stairs.
I heard a voice talking so I opened my eyes to see who it was.

WHAT HAD HAPPENED I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING.without the glasses on.

It was the eye doctor 
He smiled, “ It's surprising how soon your eyes get dependent on wearing glasses”

What had I done, Was I now TOTALLY dependent on wearing these glasses, would my eyesight never return to normal?


The month went very fast and I really enjoyed the work.
I was now used to wearing MY glasses, and despite the thickness of MY lenses I had many nice  comments about them.

On Saturday at lunch time the dr said he was happy with my work and if I wanted to stay I could choose what frame I would like to wear next week
Then he said he would check my eyes again.

This time I was determined not  to cheat, but what had happened shocked me.
 I really couldn't read any further than the third line even with these glasses on  and I had forgotten what the next lines were. He then placed the test frame on me again and added more and more lenses
 after what seems ages I could read line 6.

Before we went home the technician handed the doctor a glasses case.

“Come here Miss Elizebeth your new glasses are ready”

As the doctor placed the new glasses on my face I was shocked.
I had expected everything on the other side of the shop to be clear and sharpe just like the test frames had been,
But it was just like the first pair had been,was the doctor playing me at my own game.

“You will soon get used to them, I have made them a little stronger than you need,JUST LIKE YOU WANTED IN YOUR FIRST PAIR”

He smiled at me again.

What could I say I needed the job and it was my fault I started it.
DID HE LIKE GIRLS THAT WORE THICK GLASSES.

It was very difficult to see to get home get home this time,
He must have increased my prescription a lot,not only were my lens much thicker and even heavier, but everything in the distance was just like a thick fog had descended into my world,it was just like the day I got MY first pair of glasses.I tried removing them but without any glassess it was TOTALLY impossible to see anything now 

Why had I let him put my first pair in the charity bin.and it was very difficult to manage with My new glasses but without any it was TOTALLY impossible.
It was good that it was my long weekend, was that the reason why he decided to change my glasses today?.

Each month I got a pay rise , then had my eyes tested and a long weekend to get used to the extra power of my new glasses.

It's now one year since I started working here and this time I noticed the prescription he had written down

R- 25.25 - 2.75 170 prism out 6
L -28 .25 - 3.75 175 prism out 8 

None of it meant anything to me.

I am earning much more now than when I was working in the Bank.I can soon put a deposit down to buy my own house  
I'm now completely dependent on wearing these glasses,And my eyes look so tiny peering through the exstream thickness of MY lens.
But it seems a small price to pay,to get my own home


At lunch time I was talking to the receptionist that works in the hearing aid department, she told me she was going to hand in her notice at the end of the month..
That afternoon I kept thinking why did they need 2 receptionists.I could do both
The week seemed to go very slow.On Saturday lunchtime the Boss suggested we check my eyesight and I could choose a new frame from the spring range that had just arrived,as it had been nearly 9 months since my eyes were checked also my frames needed adjusting.

I pretended not not to hear everything,but I'm not sure that was such a good idea
 
“You seem a little undecided which is best, so I think it's time we used a different type of lens”
“You have a customer at the counter I will explain tonight”

What did he mean,I know I need stronger lenses, but I could see everything perfectly clearly walking around with the test frames on,I only pretended to hesitate so we could talk about the hearing aid department. 

The last customer had left and as usual the technician came up from the basement and handed the doctor a case

I think it's time we fitted you with your first pair of bifocals.

My mouth dropped open, I'm much too young to wear bifocals that was not what was meant to happen.[

The lens were so ugly they were even thicker than before and had a join in the middle going all the way across the lens I didn't know what to say,

 “I thought it best if we used Franklin bifocals, it will be easier to see when you are at the reception desk. Also, I have noticed you seem to be having problems with your hearing lately. I hope it won't affect your work..

What was he talking about? I only pretend not to hear today so we could talk about the possible job vacancy in the hearing aid department.

“I'm sure I can manage easily”

“I think it would be a good idea to test your hearing,just so I can be sure you can hear ok.

Why did he give me that smile?

30 minutes later he opened 2 grey boxes marked Siemens hearing aids  model T11

What was he doing,why was he Hooking those Huge things over my tiny ears and pushing those plugs into my earsi”
At first I could hear nothing,then suddenly his voice came booming into both my ear the pain was intense. Why was my own voice so loud in my head when I spoke. 

“At first everything will sound loud but you will soon get used to It “
“I'm pleased we tested your hearing,I now know WHY you had problems hearing some things I said today.

He smiled again.

“Also if you want to be considered for the position as the replacement receptionist for the hearing aid department you stand a better chance of getting the position if you are wearing Siemens hearing aids”

Before I had time to say anything.

“I'm sure it will only take you a few days to get used to wearing these 2 hearing aids,I was surprised how soon you adapted to wearing glasses.

He smiled again 

What had I done?
Just over 2 years ago I had perfect eyesight and hearing.
Now look at me.

“Would you like to join me for a meal tonight, then you can get used to your new bifocals and decide if the hearing aids help you”

We had a lovely meal together,I found the bifocals easier to use than I had expected.

I'm sitting opposite Williams At the dinner table.

My tiny eyes are now peering through these thick bifocal lens and I'm wearing large hearing aids in both ears,

William was smiling as I kept looking up and down,first to read the menu  then looking at him, I have to practice wearing bifocals.as I expect I will have to wear them for the rest of my life 
.
 “You look very pretty Dear”

“Thank you William”
“It has been a wonderful evening  I love MY new bifocals, I can see so well now,also MY hearing aids are a great help, I never realised I needed them before”

William just smiled in that knowing way he has.

I'm sure you will  enjoy working as a receptionist for both our departments from next month.

“Would you mind if You had to wear hearing aids all the time Elizabeth”

“I really enjoy wearing them, So If you find me more  attractive wearing them I would like to wear them all the time now, especially for you”

“That is nice I do find you very beautiful and sexy wearing bifocals and hearing aids 

“I think we will make a good partnership maybe we should get married now we have both got what we wanted”
 
 He gave a big smile.
