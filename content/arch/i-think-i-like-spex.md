---
Bryson is a sturdy ,athletic boy , an average student, who loves playing sports. He always likes to be the best and plays to win , sometimes he is a bit of a bully.
School was finished for the year and the baseball season was in full swing. Bryson was a pitcher , but also played outfield, was a very good hitter, a good all around player.   Toward the end of the season their team was in the playoffs, when every game was important.
Bryson had pitched in their last game and they had won, to day he played in the outfield, the other outfielders with him were Jeff and Peter.
A high fly ball came toward the outfield, Bryson called to Jeff it is yours, Jeff saw it coming to late and the ball dropped in for a hit.
Bryson got mad , are you blind , what is the matter with you? Jeff said I am sorry I did not see it till it was to late.
During the next game , with the bases loaded, Jeff struck out . Bryson gave Jeff a piece of his mind, until the coach stopped it and said remember we are playing to have fun., nobody is perfect.
After the game the coach talked to Jeff .  Jeff told him he was sorry , sometimes he had trouble seeing the ball coming.
The coach who wore glasses ,asked Jeff if he ever had an eye exam. Jeff said no, so the coach suggested  it might help him to get his eyes checked.
After discussing it with his parents , he had his eyes examined and was told he was myopic and should wear glasses.
After  he got his new glasses, he noticed a big improvement in his vision and was happy about that, he did not mind wearing glasses,.
Jeff was a handsome boy , growing fast and becoming a handsome young man , and the glasses suited him, he looked great.
Jeff proudly wore his glasses to the final game. The coach told Jeff he was happy to have suggested an  eye exam. Jeff thanked him because he had not realized he had a vision problem.
Bryson of course had to make some smart remarks, but later apologized to Jeff, who ended up being the hero of the game, with a clutch hit and a couple of very good catches, and they won their game.
The new school year started and Jeff and Bryson were in the same class.
Bryson was on the football team. He was popular with the girls and the boys and loved all the attention.
Wearing glasses now and enjoying his improved vision, Jeff liked school much better , he was a member of the drama club , and was a member of the school band.
Bryson still picked on Jeff, called him Mr. 4 eyes and a sissy to join the drama club. Jeff did not car he liked what he was doing.

The next year Jeff had another eye exam and a change in his prescription, the Doctor told him since he had grown so much it was to be expected.  His new glasses looked great, a bit stronger and showed some rings.  The girls liked him, but he did not care, they seemed so silly, he liked boys better.
Bryson was the star on the football team, and enjoyed all the attention he was getting, but that came to an abrupt stop, when he hurt his knee and could not play football anymore. 
The only girl that Bryson had paid any attention to was Jenny, she was no real beauty , but she wore strong glasses with lots of rings showing, that seemed to make her eyes sparkle, and Bryson liked that.
He started to notice other people who wore glasses and started to like the look of them on other people.
 He had also noticed how handsome  Jeff looked wearing glasses and it seemed to turn him on.

Bryson was ready to get his drivers permit. When he went to apply, failed the vision test. He could not believe it there was anything wrong with his vision. The next surprise was when he had his eyes examined and was told he was myopic and had some astigmatism, and should wear glasses.
When he looked at all the glasses frames that were available and tried them on ,became excited, and had not realized he could look so good wearing glasses, and liked the feel of them.  At last he decide on a frame and the optician told him it was an excellent choice.
When he went to pick up his glasses and tried the on , could not believe how much they improved his eyesight, and when looking in the mirror liked what he saw. Getting glasses might not be such a bad thing.
At school he received a lot of compliments from both the girls and the boys and enjoyed the attention.
Jeff his classmate congratulated Brysonon becoming Mr. 4 eyes, and told him how good he looked and welcomed him to the glasses club. Bryson appreciated the gesture and told Jeff he was sorry for the times that he bullied him. Jeff said thanks, that is in the past, no reason we cannot be friends.

About a year later Jeff had another eye exam, and the new glasses with the stronger lenses made him look better than ever. Bryson liked the looks of Jeff and his new glasses, and told him he looked fantastic, good enough to kiss.
A short time later Bryson was due for his eye exam. When he entered the optical shop Jeff was there , to get his glasses adjusted. Bryson told him he was due for his eye exam , and asked Jeff if he would mind waiting and help him select a new frame.
Jeff told him he be glad to help
When Bryson s exam was finished , they had a good look around, and tried many different frames. Bryson asked Jeff  what do you think will look really good? Jeff suggested a plastic black frame and they than decided on a frame that both he and Jeff thought looked good.

While at the food court waiting for Bryons glasses to be made, they talked about a lot f things. Jeff asked Bryson about Jenny, did he still see her. Bryson told him he had not seen her for quite a while.  He had only liked Jenny because he was fascinated with her glasses , the rings in her lenses , and the looks of her eyes. He told Jeff girls are not important.
After a while they went to pick up Bryson s new glasses .
Bryson loved his new look, liked the looks of the stronger lenses and the fell of the frame.
Jeff was speechless , Bryson looked so beautiful.

They decided to go to see a movie and try the new glasses.. While watching the show Jeff s hand slowly moved over Bryson s thigh, he could not help himself, Bryson was so attractive and beautiful, it turned him on.
Bryson smiled , he liked the feel of Jeff s hand on his thigh, and slowly put Jeff s hand on his arousal. Than Bryson gave Jeff a little 
feel ,and invited him to his place after the show. Jeff thought that was a good idea and sounded like the beginning of a new friendship.
