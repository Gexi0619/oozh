TThe glasses wearing actress.


I will never, forget the day, that my mother told my father, Julie, has to wear glasses, and a patch, on her strong eye.
Me, wearing glasses, was bad enough, but an eye patch, all the kids, at school will be making, fun of me, and call me names.
My mother made, sure I wore my patch all the time, and told me, it is only for a short time, and then you will grow up, to be a beautiful, young woman.


About 2 years later, I was told, I did not have to wear my patch anymore.
but still had to wear my glasses.
In the mean time , my mother made sure, I had dancing, gymnastics and other classes, so I would grow up to be, what she called, a well rounded young lady.


When I started High School, my eyes were normal again, and I did not have to wear my glasses anymore.
I was so happy, because, I had started to develop in all the right place, and started to feel like a young lady, and certainly, did not want, to wear glasses.
I joined, the high school drama club, and the local drama club, because I love, getting dressed up, and acting on stage.
My mother, signed me up, for a self improvement course, so I would learn to walk properly, and how, to apply your make up,,and all other girly things. 
I am very proud, of my dark blonde hair, and the way I look. 
Now, I enjoy, taking part, in some local fashion shows, it is so much like acting, at a fashion show, you have to show, the clothes, and accessories ,
for the merchants, who pay for the show.


After, finishing High School, I went on, to study, acting, literature., and fashions.
After graduating, I started to work for a large fashion firm.


Part, of my job, was to model, for photos, to be used for advertising.
Also to model different garments for potential buyers., and to model at the 
large seasonal shows.


The biggest surprise, was when I was approached, to addition, for a part in a T.V .series.
My dream come true,


When I went for the audition, after answering many questions, I was asked to wear wear, a pair of glasses, so they could see, what I looked like wearing glasses.
There were, a large number of young women, at the audition, so I did not want to get my hopes up, for the acting position.


About a week, later, I was informed, that I had been selected for the part, in the T V series.
I was, asked to come to the studios, for orientation.


When I arrived at the studio, I was handed a copy, of the part, that I would be playing.
When, I read the introduction, noticed, that I will be, a glasses wearing girl.
I did not know, what to think about that, I certainly, was not looking forward, to wearing glasses again.
When, I spoke, to the director of the show, he told me, my glasses wearing look, at the audition got me the job, and that he would, like to get a few more pictures, of me wearing glasses.
I was send, to another department, where they would take some photos of me.
When I got there, I was asked to sit, and make sure, I wear the glasses, he handed to me.
I looked at the glasses, they looked different, but I put the glasses on, as had asked me..
When looking through the lenses, I sure could not see very well.
The lights, and the flashes, while taking the pictures, sure hurt my eyes.
After the photo shoot was finished, and I removed the glasses, noticed a big change in my vision., everything in the distance looked fuzzy .
Well, after I get home, I will put some eye drops in, that will fix it.


The following morning, I was shocked my distance vision was gone, and I had to hold everything very close to be able to see, and wondered, what had happened to my vision.
I, had my breakfast, and was ready, for the car from the studio, to come, and get me..
When, the car came, the driver told me, I was going to the optical department, to get the glasses, I needed to wear, for my role, as a glasses wearing girl.


The Doctor, gave me a complete eye exam, and told me, that I am myopic.
I could not believe it, I had an eye exam, about 3 months ago, and my vision was 20/20
He told me, sometimes, the flash, while taking pictures can effect your vision, and in your case, you have become myopic, and have to wear glasses, full time, your prescription, is now - 4,00.
I am getting, two pairs of glasses, one pair for the show, and I can select anther pair, for my daily use.


Finding a suitable frame, with impaired vision, is not easy, and I had to go by the suggestion, of the optician, and pictures on my phone.
I sure was not looking forward, having to wear glasses again, but with my poor vision, I did not have any choice


I was asked, to wait for my glasses to be made, so I sat patiently waiting, and wondering, what had happened to my eye sight., was it because of the glasses they made me wear, or the flashbulbs they used.
Well. I guess I will never find out, all I know for sure is, that I am back to wearing glasses again.,
Now, I wonder, how will I look? 
I found out shortly after, when the optician, handed me my glasses, and I put them on .
Looking in the mirror, to see how I looked, I noticed what looked liked rings, at the edges of my lenses.
I was surprised, I looked that good, after having a good look, at my self.
The frame looked nice, I kind of liked the looks, of the stronger lenses, as if 
they featured my eyes. 
I was glad to notice, that my vision, was good again, no fuzziness, when I looked at distant objects. 


It did not take me long, to get back into my glasses routine, of putting the glasses on, first thing in the morning, and taking them off when going to bed.


The production of the show went fast, and I enjoyed doing my part, in each of the episodes.


Soon, after the show, had been shown on T V , I started to get E mails, and letters from all over.
I never realized, a glasses wearing person, would be so popular, they all commented, how nice, my prescription glasses looked, and are glad to see, I did not wear plain lenses. 


With all the fan mail, I received, there was one, that I answered., right away.
It was an invitation, to have dinner, from an optometrist .
When, I met him, at a very fancy restaurant, I liked the guy, the minute, I met him.
George, is a very handsome, well build, glasses wearing person.
After, we had settled, in a cozy looking corner, we certainly had lots to talk about.
When, we parted, we made arrangements, to meet again.


During our next dinner, I asked George, how it was possible, that my vision went from normal, to – 4.00 just like that.
Emily, I have heard about it, it does not happen, very often, and there is nobody, who can explain why. 
Don’t worry about it, you are a beautiful, glasses wearing lady.


I am getting used, to looking at myself, wearing glasses, and I now like, my glasses wearing look.
I really like the looks of the lenses, and wonder, how the lenses, on a higher prescription would look.
When I asked George, he thinks, I might like that look.
As you can see, my prescription, is in the – 6.00 range, you will see more rings, and depth, at the edge of the lenses.


I went to visit George, and while there, he examined my eyes, and suggested, that the next time we meet, he will bring me some glasses, with a higher prescription, for me to try.


As promised, George, handed me two pair of glasses, for me to try. 
I tried, the glasses, and liked, the – 5.50 prescription, and could see well wearing the glasses, and looking at myself, loved the looks of the lenses.
So now, I am wearing – 5.50 glasses and love wearing them.


I wore, my new – 5.50 glasses at our last filming of the show, and now the director, wants me to wear the glasses , on all our next shows he likes the glasses., and so did our audience, I received a lot of good comments from our viewers.
I never, would have believed, that wearing prescription glasses, on T V , can make you a celebrity,
I love my glasses.
