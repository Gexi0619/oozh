description: In Part 1 and 2, Anne's hearing aid malfunction leads to an unexpected discovery about her hearing.
---
Please read part 1 and 2 first 

It was a lovely sunny morning so I suggested to Anne that we go out for the day.
”What did you say dear,I don't think my left hearing aid is working as well now".
“Do you remember Robert said they had special offers this month on hearing aids, could you afford to buy me new ones,I'm so used to wearing them I really need them now .I know I just wanted to know what the feeling was like to wear them, it made me feel sexy and I loved you touching me when you put them in that day, but now I find it hard to hear without them I have got so used to hearing better”
“Yes dear if they really help you then if they are not to expensive then we ask Robert what he thinks,your new moulds are there as well I had forgotten to tell you they rang 2 weeks ago.

“Hello Anne how are you today,and it's  nice to see you walking again Tony have you come to collect your glasses that we put a new arm on for you”
“No I had forgotten all about them I'm so used to wearing these and using my cane i gives me so much confidence,but they will be useful if I broke these,You said that you might have some special offers on hearing aids this month, my left hearing aid is not working as well now””.  
“Yes that's true I sent you a SMS last week,We were very busy yesterday,I expect we will have some left,shall we get your hearing tested first”.

I thought this will be interesting, what will Anne say when they find out that they are not her hearing aids, and her hearing is ok.
45 minutes  later Anne came down and handed Robert a pice of paper.
Robert looked at the paper then turned to Anne.
“How long did you say you have been wearing hearing aids”
I looked at Anne ,thinking to myself,she has been caught out,how is she going to explain this.
“I can't remember,when I got them,but it was only last month I started wearing them again”
“Is there a problem”I said to Robert.
“Well yes there is nothing wrong with this hearing aid”
O god I thought how do we explain this.
Robert looked at me.” The problem is Anne's hearing has got a lot worse now and she needs stronger hearing aids”.
Anne looked at me and smiled”you see dear I told you my hearing was bad now”

“Unfortunately all the smaller hearing aids that we reduced have gone,if Anne wanted smaller hearing aids the cheapest we have is 4,000 pounds each.We have some the same size as Anne is wearing now are  about 2,500 each”

.We still have some large aids at 1,500 each but as its you Tony you could have the pair for 2,000.they are just as good as the expensive models, just bigger and more noticeable”.
“That is ok with me Tony you don't need to spend all that money on the small type the bigger models are fine with me,I like the red ones Tony”.
“I will take them upstairs and get them set up so you can wear them home”.
“While they set them up for you Anne I think I would like to look at your eyes and also test your vision
“It's good you came today,you have the start of another infection again,where 
your blind eye was removed”
“Will Tony clean it each night for you and put these drops in,were you warned that if you get a very bad infection then you could have to have your eye socket completely removed,that would affect that side of your face”
“Don't worry dear I will clean it for you,I know you like me doing it”
“The sight in your other eye has got worse,the Sph is the same but you need more astigmatism correction ,I think we had better change that lens’ I will change the stick on fresnel lens as well,Your eye is turning in more I will increase it to 20 out.
“Can you put the same thickness lens in for both eyes, I thinks i look strange with a Plano lens in my blind side”
“Are you really sure June”

“I love the new hearing aids, everything is so much clearer now you voice is  louder but the background noise seems to have gone’ what do you think Tony?
“Do you mind them being so big”.
“They are fine dear,I know they are very large,you look sexy and it excites you me putting them in for you”
“Maybe Tony has red glasses that would match them”

An hour later Robert called us back in.
“I managed to find a red frame the same colour as your hearing aids and I have made both lens the same thickness like you wanted,but with the new prescription I'm afraid the lens had to be even thicker than before”
“Can Tony put them on for me ,I feel safe when he does it, I know he accepts me as I am”

“Can you hold my hand dear I can't see so well at the moment with the new lens”
“We're are we going Tony,my right  eye is hurting it feels like it's being pulled away from my nose”
“Don't worry dear,Robert said he had increased the prism a lot to keep your eye straight”
“Why didn't you tell me, I had a lazy eye”
“As long as you could see dear that's all that mattered”
“We need some more tobacco”
“You sit there dear”
 I turned to look at Anne,she looked helpless sitting there holding her cane between her knees,her left eye socket  looked a little red,and the extra power together with the thicker lens made it more obvious that she had her eye removed,also Robert had only put the stick on fresnel lens on her right lens so you could just see a large eye and what looked like hundreds of lines running from top to bottom.
“Can you come closer please Tony i can't see what you are buying”
“I thought you might like this new lady's tobacco pipe in red and this cherry flavoured tobac
“You are so kind to me Tony, I came to look after you,now you are having to look after me,I'm sorry”
“Nothing to be sorry about. To me you look beautiful dear”
“It's lovely and sunny now,here is your cane darling, lets go over to the park and have a coffee”

“Can I see the new red pipe you bought me,will you open the pouch please ,the cherry tobacco smell lovely”

As soon as we got home Anne started to cry.
“What is the problem dear “.
“I think I must look so ugly now with these glasses the lens are so heavy, I know I wanted the left lens to look the same but I think I have made a mistake they 
“hurt my nose,and my right eye feels as if it's being pull to one side”
“You look beautiful dear,your right eye looks much straighter now dear”.
“ I love your new red glasses and your big red hearing aids”
“Do you want to try your new red pipe it will help you relax”
“Yes please Tony”
“Here you are dear,just hold it between your lips while I light it for you”
Smoke was exhaling out of her nose as she sucked hard on her pipe.
I started kissing her ears and her hearing aids,the more I kissed her ears the more her hearing aids whistled and the more she exhaled the sweet smelling smoke out of her nose.the bowl of her pipe was glowing bright red.
“I Feel drunk and light headed”
“Where is you pipe Tony I want to fill it and light it for you”
“ O  Tony Tony what are you doing O O Tony”
“Just showing you that you are beautiful and I love you”
“That was was so special Tony,,can we smoke again when we go to bed”
“Is your pipe empty now i hope you enjoyed us both smoking as much as I did”
“Can I keep my hearing aids in Please Tony”
I slowly took her glasses off,there was a deep red mark were the heavy glasses had been resting on her nose. Without the aid of the prism her lazy eye almost instantly disappeared into the corner.
“She was breathing heavily as I cleaned the socket of her blind eye.
Then I gently lifted my one eyed goddess into bed with me”

“I don't think you should light your new red pipe in bed dear”
“Yes maybe you are right, I can just suck it, and play with your pipe instead dear,
“O Tony what has happened to your pipe,it looks very different tonight,
“How you mean dear”
“It looks much bigger Tony”
“I think it's your new glasses,they look very sexy on you’ I think that why my pipe looks bigger”
“O Tony it feels bigger,are you sure it's my glasses making it bigger”
“Yes dear you look so beautiful with your new glasses and red hearing aids that's why my pipe is bigger”
“O haha Tony I get it now xx “
“Do you really  think I'm pretty even wearing the hugh thick lens”
“Yes dear it makes you look very sexy and special also your big red hearing aids add something extra”
