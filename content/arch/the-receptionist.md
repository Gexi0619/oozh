In this story we are bringing back Jim and Marsha , The owners of Jones Optical
{ see stories of Jim and Marsha 1,2,3]

Shelley was a receptionist in a high class building. A pleasant ,good looking girl, with a great smile and personality, and was well
liked by all the tenants. She shared her job with Ann, who relieved her for breaks, a pleasant older lady, easy to get along with.
Ann wore contact lenses, because her boss did not like any of his staff wearing glasses.
The reception desk was located near the entrance, which was nicely decorated, with a seating arrangements and some plants,and 
looked very inviting. Shelley liked where her desk was located, she could see through the large windows , and see the traffic and what the weather was like. She talked to each person when they came in and directed them to the right location.She liked her job.

One day when Ann came to relieve Shelley,she said to  Ann, I think the windows lately are not as clean as they used to be ,the view seems fuzzy. Ann said I had not noticed.

Shelley was an ambitious person involved with some charities and church activities. She also took night classes in business and office management at the local university.
She befriended a pleasant girl, Joanne , she had long black hair , a pleasant face and wore glasses.They sat together, enjoyed chatting and comparing notes.

One night at class , a few weeks later, Shelley asked Joanne if she could see her notes, she was not sure if she had copied them properly from the blackboard,. When she compared her notes with Joanne s she realized that she did not have them all correct,
and wondered why.
Joanne asked what her trouble was . Shelley said she copied all she could see, and remarked that some of the writing was not very clear. Joanne asked her if she had trouble with her vision. Shelley said my vision is perfect, always has been,
.
Joanne did not believe her, and asked if she could read the sign over the door. Shelley said there is no sign   , just the door.
Joanne removed her glasses and handed them to Shelley. Put my glasses on and look again if you can see a sign.
Shelley put the glasses on and looked at the door and saw the sign that said EXIT, tan looked around the room and could not believe that everything looked so bright and sharp.
She gave Joanne her glasses back and said I did not realize how much better I could see wearing your glasses, do you think I might need glasses?  Shelley you need an eye exam to find that out.

The next day at work Shelley made an appointment for an eye exam at Jones Optical for Saturday. She wondered , that what she 
thought were dirty windows might be due to her eyesight , she would find out on Saturday.

When on Saturday , Shelley entered Jones Optical, she was greeted by a very pleasant woman. My name is Marsha, I am the optician and here to help you. Shelley gave her name and was handed a form to fill out.
Then she was taken to the examination room and seated. Marsha did the preliminary tests and then her husband Jim , the optometrist took over.
After a thorough examination he told Shelley , your eyes are healthy, but myopic and I think wearing glasses will help you see 
everything nice and clear.
Shelley was not very happy having to wear glasses. Do I have to wear glasses all the time?  Jim said with a prescription of -1.25 in the right and - 1.00 in the left eye and some astigmatism, I would suggest you do.
Shelley was quite upset, and told Jim she could not wear glasses at work, her boss wanted everybody to look perfect, no glasses.
Jim suggested she could wear contact lenses and her boss would never know. 
Marsha fitted Shelley with contact lenses , and helped her with selecting a frame in a nice brown multicolor that looked great on her.

The next week was not a very pleasant one for Shelley, she had a hard time getting used to the contacts . She realized she could see much better now, but preferred to wear her glasses. After coming home she could not wait ti get rid of her contacts and wear her glasses.

When she went to night school, wearing her glasses, Joanne said I thought you needed  glasses, but you look terrific wearing them.
Of course the girls had to try each others glasses and after a while decided their prescription was about the same.

One day the following week, Mr. David Brown one of the tenants , who was in the optical wholesale business, a well dressed ,handsome man, wearing classy glasses, came to her desk to see if there were any messages for him, as he had been away for a 
week. Shelley told him there were no messages for him. Mr Brown looked at Shelley and asked , do you have a problem with your eyes?  Shelley told him about her eye exam and that now she was wearing contact lenses, and they were very uncomfortable.
Why don t you wear glasses? They are comfortable, fashionable and you will look good wearing them. 
So Shelley told him about her boss and his ideas.  Mr. Brown was not impressed. This day and age glasses are in fashion ,nobody 
should object to you wearing them.
He told her not to worry about her boss, he would talk to him, glasses are important to me , they are my business. 
Come into work tomorrow wearing your glasses, I would like to see you wearing them.and I will make sure there is no objection.
So the next day Shelley wore her glasses, and felt much better, the glasses were comfortable and she did not mind wearing them.
Later that morning Mr. Brown came to see Shelley, and told her she looked fantastic wearing glasses, and that he had talked to her 
boss and he had changed his mind about glasses. since Mr. Brown made his living selling to the optical businesses, he did not want to loose a tenant.
He asked her where she had bought her glasses. Shelley told him at Jones Optical.He said I thought so, you are wearing one of my new style frames.
Last week I made arrangements to get the exclusive rights to a whole new line of designer eyeglass frames. My business is growing fast and will have to start looking for somebody to help me.
Shelley asked him what kind of help he was looking for.
I need somebody to run the office, look after orders, and can sell eyeglass frames to customers coming to the office., or at optical shows.
Shelley told him she was taking an advanced business course at the university, that she liked to wear glasses, and was familiar with talking to people, and so may be a good candidate for the help you need.
Mr. Brown started to laugh and said to Shelley, I think you got yourself a new job.

 Shelley started her new job and the learning process that went it. The different manufacturers, the frames they had available, colors sizes and styles.Also the customers they sold frames and other optical needs. 
There was a lot to learn but she enjoyed it very  much.
Mr. Brown asked her to call him David, told her he was happy to see her settle in so fast and was glad to have her work with him.
He told her to select 3 frames for herself and get them made in the proper prescription at Jones Optical, so she would have a 
variety of frames to wear and model to customers. He helped her select the frames that looked really good on her and were the brands he wanted to sell.  Shelley loved it.
She took the frames to Jones optical, and told Marsha the whole story.
Marsha told Shelley that they liked David, he was a good person to do business with and you will enjoy working with him.
Her Glasses would be ready later in the afternoon.
When Shelley went to pick up her glasses and had them fitted, Marsha helped her decide which pair to wear.
The girls got along well together and Marsha invited Shelley to come for dinner the following night  at her place, to get to know each other.
Shelley was dressed but had a hard time deciding which pair of glasses to wear. She at last decided on a multicolor frame , to blend with the colors she was wearing, and was happy with the way she looked.

Jim and Marsha welcomed Shelley to  their apartment and made her feel right at home. There was lots to talk about and had a very pleasant visit. She also met their children , Kathy a 5 yr old girl and Tim who was 4.
Shelley told Marsha , if you are stuck for a baby sitter you can give me a call.  Marsha said great I have your phone number.
On the way home Shelley was very happy, she had a great job,and new friends and all because of her new glasses, she loved her glasses.
