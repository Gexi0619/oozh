We think, we have the perfect myopic family.




Dylan, is my name, I am almost 9 years old, I have two older sisters, Megan who is 11 and Ashley 
who will be 14 at her next birthday.
My mom, wears glasses, that make her eyes look a little smaller, I like that look, but she is old, and older people usually wear glasses.
My sister Ashley, started to wear glasses, about two years ago, why her, and not me?
I really want to wear glasses, I love the looks of them, and I think people look so nice wearing glasses.
In our class, there are 3 girls and 2 boys who wear glasses, all of them have thick lenses, that make their eyes look bigger, I don’t like that.
I like the type of lens that make your eyes sparkle, like my mom’s, and Ashley’s glasses, well perhaps some day soon I hope, I will be wearing glasses like that to.


When I came home from school to day, my mother told me that all of us are due for an eye exam.
We have an appointment for next Wednesday. 
I am all excited, I will pretend I can’t read the letters, and I am sure, I will be prescribed glasses.
In my dream, I can see my new glasses, I know the type of frame that I like, and of course, I am very impressed with my new glasses wearing look.
When the day of my exam came, I was all prepared in my mind, on how to get the doctor to say, Dylan, you need to wear glasses.
Ashley was the first to get her exam, and when she came out told mother, that she had an increase in 
her prescription.
Megan was all upset when she came out of the examination room, because was told, she now needed to wear glasses.
I tried to fool the doctor, and he must have noticed, because when he had the over size glasses in front of my eyes, I heard some clicks, and he said now can you read the letters?
All I could see were very fuzzy letters, and when I told him I could not, he said that is why you don’t need glasses, if you were a myopic you would not have had any trouble seeing all the letters.
Well some day, I will be myopic enough to be able to read the line, that is what I want.


After the exam, I could imagine myself taking my glasses off and looking at the blur the doctor showed me, that is what I want.
In the mean time both my sisters are now wearing new glasses, I liked Ashley’s glasses the best, this is her third pair of glasses, and her lenses look more interesting.
On a quiet Saturday morning, when my mother and sisters had gone out shopping, I went into Ashley’s room, and found her old glasses.
I took the glasses to my room and tried both pair.
The second pair were sure a lot stronger, so I decided, I would borrow them for a while, I took the glasses out of the case, and returned both cases to where I had found them, now, I had glasses to wear, when I wanted to wear them.
I had spend enough time on the computer finding out about glasses and vision, that I realized, when you are young, and your eyes are growing, you can induce myopia.
I wore the glasses every chance I had, and at first, my vision was not very good when wearing them.
I wore them working on the computer and reading and not long after, I would go for a long bike ride wearing the glasses.
It really did not take me very long to be able to see well, when wearing the glasses, I just love wearing glasses, and know that I want strong glasses, I love the looks of the lenses, that make your eyes look smaller.


About a year later, when I had my eye exam, walked out of the examination room with my own prescription,
O D -1.25, O S – 1.00, and a little bit of astigmatism, I am so happy, now I wear my own real glasses.
I had told all the guys at school, I was going to have an eye exam, and that I expected I needed to wear glasses, so when I came to school, wearing my new glasses, I was the center of attraction, and nobody teased me.
My glasses were fantastic, I could see so much better now, and my next report card showed a big improvement in my marks., and all I wish for now, is to get stronger lenses, that look like real glasses.


I am in my third year of high school, and I am sorry to say, my glasses prescription is still below 
- 4.00., I figured by now, I should be -5.00 or – 6.00, well perhaps, my eyes still have a few years left to grow.
After my next eye exam, when I was in my last year of high school, my prescription increased a little, now my prescription reads, OD – 4.00, OS – 4.25.
I love the looks of my new lenses, and feel, that now people will notice, that I wear real glasses.


To day at school, I noticed a girl that I had not seen before, I think she is beautiful, 
She wears strong myopic glasses, has an hour glass figure, and beautiful long, dark blond hair.
I soon found out, that her name is Emily, and where she lives, and I sure like to ask her for a date.
The opportunity, to meet Emily, came sooner than I had expected, when some guy bumped into her in the hallway, and she dropped the books she was carrying.
I quickly picked the books up, and handed them to her, and asked, are you all right? 
Emily smiled, yes I am fine thank you.
Dylan, is my name and I saw what happened.
Oh, that is all right, thank you Dylan, I am Emily, a new student here, and on my way to my next class.
See you later Emily, nice meeting you.
Wow, she looks fantastic, she wears the type of prescription I sure would like to wear, I guess, - 14.00, or higher., looking at the rings, and the thickness of the lenses at the edges.
That afternoon, I had a hard time thinking of anything else, than Emily, and her beautiful glasses.


A few days later, I met Emily in the hall at school again, and she greeted me by my name, and was ready to talk to me, I listened and after a while when it was time to go to the next class, I asked her for a date, and she accepted, Saturday night we are going to the mall, to see a movie.


On Saturday night, my dad let me use his car to get Emily
When I arrived at Emily’s place, she was ready, and asked me to come in and meet her parents.
Emily’s mother is as beautiful as Emily, the only difference, her glasses were stronger than Emily’s.
Her Dad, wears glasses to, but he is hyperopic. Emily’s younger sister wears glasses, but her lenses, look to be only about -4.00.
At last we were alone, and on the way to the mall, we talked about a lot of things, except glasses.
When we were seated, we were holding hands, and it was not long after a couple of kisses.
After the movie, sitting having some refreshments at the food court, I asked Emily, am I right when 
I think your prescription is about -14.00?
You are close, my right eye is -13.50, and my left eye -13.75. how did you guess.
So I told her about my love for strong myopic lenses, and I always wanted to be – 14.00 or -15.00, and at my last exam, was only -4.00, and -4.25.
Well, Dylan, I tell you a secret, I love wearing strong glasses, and I love the looks of my present lenses.
I started wearing glasses, when I was 4 years old, and my lens power increased at least 3/4 of a diopter 
after each exam.
I expect that in a few years, will end up about -16.00 my mothers prescription is -18.00.
The most exciting for me was, when Emily, let me try her glasses, while she wore mine.
When I told her I could not see wearing her glasses, she told me that she could see enough, to tell me that I looked great wearing her glasses, and I look very nice wearing lenses that strong.
O Emily, I wish!.
We both are obsessed with stronger myopic lenses, I am a sure lucky man, that I met Emily.


Emily and I had regular dates, and once and a while she would bring one of her older pairs of glasses, for me to wear, and of course, so she could see me wearing stronger lenses, and sit and look at me.


By the time, I finished my studies, and enter the working world, my glasses prescription had only increased about 1 diopter.
I wanted to do G O C and be about -15.00.
With the help of Cactus Jack, on Vision and Spex, I now have the proper lens combination.
At my last eye exam, I had a contact lens fitting, and now have the lens size to order on line.
Emily was not aware of my plan.
In the mean time I had accepted a job in another town.
So at our next date, I wore my G O C combination, which I had tried out quite a few times, and I now, was as comfortable wearing my G O C, as my regular glasses.
Emily and I went out for dinner, when I was wearing my new glasses, she was speechless for a while, and after I told her what I was doing, said I love to see you look like that all the time.
So, I promised her, I would, if she would marry me.
I now wear my G O C combination all the time, and a few people asked me about it, and I told them I 
had a big increase in my prescription.


Emily and I got married, and moved to the town where I have a job.
When I started to go to work, wore my combination, every day, and my bosses must have been satisfied with my performance, that not long after, I received a promotion and a big increase in my pay.
That sure was a blessing, because Emily is pregnant, and now we can afford to buy a house.


After moving in to our new home, Emily mentioned that she noticed a change in her vision.
When she had an eye exam, had an increase of 3/4 diopter in each eye, and is now -14.25 and -14.50 slowly creeping up, like she always had suspected. 
As always, I loved Emily’s new look, wearing the little stronger lenses.


My parents came to visit, and my mother was very concerned, when she saw my glasses.
She wanted to know what happened to me, she had never seen my strong G O C glasses.
I told her not to worry, my vision had settled down, and the doctor did not expect any big increases.
My mother mentioned to Emily, that she was hoping our children would not inherit our high myopia.
Emily agreed, but told her, that she was sure our children will be myopic.
The pregnancy went well, and Emily gave birth to our daughter Emma, I think the most beautiful baby, I had ever seen.
About a year later Emma had a sister Olivia and less than two years after, Noah came along.
We now had the pleasure of seeing our family growing up and we had a wonderful time.
.
Not long after, when Emma was ready to start school, all our children had their eye exam, and Emma as expected, was prescribed glasses for myopia, O D -1.25, O S – 1.00
Being the oldest and now going to school, was very proud of her new glasses, and wore them all the time.
A year later Olivia was prescribed glasses for myopia, with almost an identical prescription as Emma had, when she started to wear glasses.
Now we are on our way to have the perfect glasses wearing family

Noah, is so different of what the girls were like at his age, he does not show any masculinity.
He, loves to play with dolls,and dress like a girl, he has told us, numerous times, he is a girl, and wants nice long hair like his sisters.
We discussed it with our doctor, who sent us to a mental heath specialist.
After a series of test and the input from the specialist, and some other mental heath people, they told us they are sure Noah, is transgender, and it is not very often, that a child his age, communicates this well, about being in the wrong body.
They suggested to treat Noah, if he wants to, like a girl, and to come for further evaluations, before he started school.
We were shocked, it was the last thing we expected.
Spending quite a bit of time at the computer learning more about transgender and treatment, we accepted the fact, and Emily and I decided, that we should, as the experts had suggested let Noah show what he is.
Emily, is going with Noah, to visit her mother, and stay there for a couple of days, and get her help.


When Emily and Noah met her mother, Noah told his grand mother that he is going to be a girl now.
Emily, had been talking to her mother and she knew what was going on, and told Noah she was so happy.
Emily and her mother went shopping in one of the big department stores, and received a real eyeopener, when Noah, ran into the girls clothing section, and wanted Emily to buy him his own dress.
He knew what he wanted, and after Emily had bought the dress wanted pretty shoes.
On the way to the cashier, Noah spotted a rack of fake glasses, and wanted a pair, so he could look the same as all the other girls.


As soon as they came home, Noah wanted to get dressed in all the new clothes, and proudly showed his grandparents how nice he now looked being a glasses wearing girl.
When Emily and Noah came home wearing the new clothes and glasses, we told the girls, they now had another sister, instead of a brother.
They told us that if Noah is a girl, she should then have a girls name. 
They suggested Ella, to sound similar to Noah .
So now we have another girl, who likes her new name .
Ella seemed very happy, being girl, and after about 6 months, with her hair longer, sure looks like a pretty little girl.
At the next family eye exam, Ella was prescribed real glasses, O D -0.75 and O S -1.00.
The girls, had only a small increase in their prescription.


About10 years later.


Emma, is now, in her last year of high school, both her eyeglasses prescription, and Olivia’s are in the -5.00 range, both girls are excellent students.
Ella, is under doctor’s care for hormone treatments, and is growing into a beautiful young girl, and likes wearing her -4.00 glasses.
We are very proud of our myopic family, and love looking at our beautiful glasses wearing girls.
We think, we have the perfect myopic family.
