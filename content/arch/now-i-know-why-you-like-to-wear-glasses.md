Now, I know, why you like to wear glasses.




Cathy, is my name, I am the youngest member in our family, I have three brothers, and all of them wear glasses for myopia.
My mother is myopic, and wears, I think, strong prescription glasses because her eyes look smaller, behind the lenses of her glasses, my dad wears glasses for reading. 
I have often wondered when I will be told at our annual eye exam, that I need to wear glasses, but so far that has not happened, and I often wonder why?


I am now in my third year of high school, I am an above average student, and enjoy going to school.
Jo Anne, is my best friend, a very pleasant glasses wearing girl, she is myopic,
She told me that after the last exam, her prescription is now over -2.00.
Of course I have tried her old and her new glasses, but I can’t see well wearing them, I guess I won’t be wearing glasses for a while.
I would not mind, having to wear glasses, I like the looks of glasses, and never heard any complaints
about having to wear glasses, from anyone in our family.


We are approaching the end of the school year, time for the final exams.
I am studying real hard the last few weeks, and have experienced a lot more headaches lately, which is strange, I very seldom, have a headache.
I find it a nuisance, and after the end of the school year, will have to go and see our doctor, and find out why I have more headaches lately.


Today we finished our exams, and my marks have slipped a little, and I am sure, I now know why,
studying when having a headache, sure makes it more difficult to concentrate.
I have discussed with my mother, about having the headaches, and she has made a doctors appointment, for me to have a complete check up, at the end of the school year.


When, I entered the doctors office, I was told that the doctor had been delayed at the hospital,
but should be available shortly.
Since there are three doctors practising in this office, there are always quite a few people in the waiting room.
I did not mind having to wait, I find it always interesting, to look at the patients,
to see who wears glasses, and the type of their prescription, mothers with children, elderly people, and I always find somebody who likes to talk to you, which can be very interesting.
When my name was called, I went in, and was greeted by our doctor.
She is a glasses wearing female, a very pleasant person who makes you feel at ease.
After I told her why I was there, and after she had examined me asked, when was your last eye exam?
I asked her why?
Well Cathy, I think you have the same problem I had, when I was about your age. 
I think you are hyperopic, and you might have some astigmatism, which would cause headaches, but you will need an eye exam to make sure, and when you get glasses with the right prescription, wearing the glasses should fix your problem.
I was really surprised, me wearing glasses without being myopic, what a surprise.
So I asked the doctor, you had the same experience as I have now?
Yes , Cathy it sure sounds like it.
Then I had a good look at the glasses she was wearing, the lenses magnified her eyes a little, I liked that look. 
I liked it because my eyes are not that big, well I will have to wait to find out, how I will look after I get my glasses.
What a surprise, I need to wear glasses, and I am not myopic, my mother won’t believe it.
When I came home, and told my mother my story, she could not believe it, and phoned for an appointment for an eye exam.


When I had my eye exam, Dr. Jones took a while, after he was asking me which is better 1 or 2, and up to ten and then when finished said, well you developed some astigmatism, which I think is the cause of your headaches, you are also low hyperopic, and should wear your glasses full time.
Well, exactly as I suspected, now the hard part, to find a real nice pair of glasses that look really good on me.


When I entered the optical shop in the mall, a very pleasant glasses wearing lady waited on me, and assisted me to find a fantastic looking frame that I really liked.
After selecting the frames, the optician took all the measurements,
and I was told my glasses would be ready in about a couple of hours.
So I went to the food court where I met Carol, one of my class mates.
After telling her my story why I was at the mall, and about me having to start wearing glasses she surprised me when she told me she is also waiting for her new glasses.
She told me her story, she is myopic, and she hates the thought of having to wear glasses.
When we figured it was time for our glasses to be ready, we went to the optical store together to pick up our glasses.
Carol’s glasses were ready, when we got there, and after she had them adjusted, showed me her new look.
I thought she looked fantastic, and I told her so, she was not so sure and looked in the mirror again.
Then when Carol had a good look around and then outside, I noticed a smile on her face, and she said, it is going to take me a while to get used to my new look, but now also realize I can see so much better when wearing the glasses, that I soon might start liking my glasses.
Before I could say goodbye to Carol, I was told my glasses were ready.
When I had a good look at myself, loved my new glasses look, my eyes looked so nice behind the lenses, my eyes looked brighter, and a little larger.
The optician told me that because of the astigmatism correction, and to see clearly in the distance, it might be at least a week, for my vision to adjust, but to make sure I wear them full time.
Carol complimented me on how nice I looked wearing glasses, and I agreed, I love my new glasses.


When at home, I got teased, because I was not myopic, but they all liked my new glasses wearing look.
After about a week, my distance vision was almost perfect, and I had not had any headaches.
When I went to visit my friend Jo-Anne, she really loved my new glasses look.
She commented on nice my eyes looked behind the lenses, and told me she was so happy for me that wearing the glasses, had helped eliminated my head aches.


After the summer when I went back to school, I was really surprised to see so many more of the students were wearing glasses now.
I guess that is why there were only so few comments on me wearing glasses now.
There is also a new student in our class, Amy, a very pleasant beautiful girl, with a nice head of blond hair, and a figure like a model, I heard the guys say, she is a real knock out
Her family had moved into town during the summer, and I am sure, she could use some friends.
Amy, is very easy to talk to, and asked if she could join us for lunch, so we told her yes, we love you to join us.


So Jo-Anne and I had lunch with her, and we had a very pleasant conversation, and got to know her a little better, and vise versa.
It was not long after, that the three of us became good friends, and we visited back and forth regularly.
Amy, was well versed on fashion and make up, and taught us quite a few new tricks, which we appreciated.


A few weeks later on a Saturday, we were meeting at Jo-Anne’s place.
When we arrived, Jo-Anne let us in.
I loved her new look, she was wearing her new glasses, that she had just picked up this morning, we both congratulated her on how nice she looked.
She was all smiles, and told us how she loved her new look.
I really like my new frame, but what I like best is, the looks of the stronger lenses. she told us, and again my prescription went up again, and I am past the -3.00 mark, and love to get up to -5.00 or better.
Amy said, you want stronger lenses? 
Yes, I love the looks of them.
Amy could not believe that anybody could be happy wearing glasses, and wishing for a stronger prescription, so I told Amy, that I love wearing my glasses.
What is there to like about having to wear glasses?
Well when you start to wear glasses, you now have perfect vision, glasses are very comfortable to wear, and most of the time do not realize you are wearing them.
When you have your eye exam and a new prescription, get new glasses that you like, and you have a new look again.
Amy said, I guess that is something to look forward to, the only glasses, I ever wore were sunglasses,
and you only wear them for style, you sure can’t see how your eyes look.
So I asked her, would you like to try my glasses?
Yes, I would like to,.
When she tried my glasses, her eyes looked nice and bright, and she looked real good wearing glasses.
When Amy looked in the mirror, was surprised and said, I like the looks of me wearing glasses, and how nice my eyes look.
Jo-Anne said, my present glasses will be too strong for you, would you like to try one of my older ones.
Yes , I think this new to me, and is exciting, so Jo-Anne handed her an older pair, and when Amy looked around, could not believe, that when wearing the glasses, she could see so much better anything 
further away. 
Amy walked over to a window and looked out, I cannot believe it, I can see leaves on the trees, and everything nice and clear down the street, these glasses are fantastic.
You cas see so much better, and they sure change your looks.
I never realized glasses can do all that, no wonder you girls like to wear glasses.
Well, I think, you need to have an eye exam, I am sure you are myopic.
Yes, I am going to get glasses.


About a week later, Amy cam to school wearing glasses, and as always she looked fantastic.
She was all smiles, when she told us, I just love my new glasses, and now I know why you girls like to wear glasses.
