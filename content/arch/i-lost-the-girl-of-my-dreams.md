I lost the girl of my dreams.


At my age, it is very upsetting, being a teenager, and grade A student, in his second last year of high school. to be coming home after school, in the middle of a semester, to be told that next week we will be moving to a large city.
My dad received a promotion, and is moved to replace a person who passed away.
The house we will be moving into, is supplied by the company, and our furniture will be moved on Friday.
I hate the thoughts of leaving, all my familiar surroundings, and friends, but have no choice.
The principal of the school I attend, is familiar with the area we are be moving to, and arranged for me to start at a school, close to where we will be living, to admit me, and he will send my academic records to them.
At least I will not lose a year, all I have to do is make the most of it, and try to find some new friends.


We have moved in to our new house, and I have a beautiful big room overlooking the street.
I have all weekend to get settled, without having to think about homework 
We met the family that was leaving, and I met the boy, about my age, who used the room, that I now use.
He mentioned that I might find some stuff, that he left in his closets, that I could have if I wanted it., otherwise to throw it away.
So being curious, I looked and noticed some exercise equipment and a small box.
I took the box to my desk, and opened it, and there were some notes, and a few glasses cases.
Now I remember he was wearing fairly strong glasses.
When I opened the glasses cases noticed that the 4 pair of glasses, that were in the box, all seemed to have the same frame, but different prescription lenses, glancing at the papers, I noticed notes about inducing myopia, and other optical information.
I had never tried a pair of glasses before in my life, so I became curious, and I tried all the glasses.
When I was wearing the one pair of glasses, and looking across the street, noticed, that I had no trouble reading the house numbers, which I could not read when not wearing the glasses.


When I tried, which looked to me like a little stronger lenses, the house numbers were not quite as clear, but I could make them out ..
I put the first pair of glasses back on, and really looked around, wearing the glasses sure improved my vision, should I be wearing glasses?
I walked to the bathroom, wearing the glasses to see what I looked like, wearing glasses, and noticed I looked really good. 
After wearing the glasses for a while, and the frame feeling so comfortable, I really started to enjoy wearing the glasses, and the improvement in my vision.
I had an other look at the glasses cases, and noticed inside each case was a piece of paper, which looked to me like a prescription.
Because I had lots of time on my hands, started the computer, and study up on glasses and vision, and read up on how to read a glasses prescription.
Looking at the papers again, noticed that each of the glasses was a diopter stronger.
The glasses I was wearing, were-1,50, on both lenses, and the next pair -2.50
I wore the glasses off and on most of the weekend, making sure my parents, and my sister did not see me wearing glasses, because I would have a lot of explaining to do.
Believe me, I am starting to enjoy wearing the glasses, and when I went to school on Monday took the glasses, with me in my schoolbag, and started to wear the glasses in the classroom.
Now being a glasses wearer, I for the first time noticed, that at least half of the students are wearing glasses.
I certainly did not receive any comments, and I now realize when looking around, that girls who wear glasses, sure do look very attractive.
Wearing glasses was now all I wanted, because with my improved vision, and the glasses being so comfortable, I had a hard time remembering, to remove them, before I came home.
How was I going to tell my parents, who wanted perfect children, that I should be wearing glasses.
A couple of weeks later, I started to wear the -2.50 glasses, and was very comfortable wearing them, my vision sure was good..
Now, it was becoming more, and more difficult for me, to be able to see well without wearing glasses.


Toward the end of the school season, at the school that my sister attended, it was customary, that all students graduating to go to high school, have to have an eye exam, and report the results, to the school, before graduating.
That might be one reason, why so many high school students wear glasses.


I was sure delighted, when I came home one day, and my mother informed me, I was to have an eye exam., on the weekend, with my sister, and she told me why.
By this time I had started to wear the -3.50. glasses, and could see well, when wearing them.
Thank goodness, an eye exam, and I am sure, I will be told to wear glasses, then I will be able to wear my glasses all the time, and see properly.


My mother could not believe the results of the eye exams, both her children were prescribed to wear glasses.
My new prescription read, OD, -3.25, and OS, -3.00. and some astigmatism.
I loved my new glasses, and the clear vision they gave me., and had chosen a frame the same as I had been wearing before, they were readily available on line, and was undecided if I should try to become more myopic.
My sister was not very happy, that she had to wear glasses, but once she started high school, and saw the number of the girls wore glasses, did not complain anymore.


Our family went to church regularly, and now wearing glasses, and seeing better, noticed things, I was not able to see before.
In the choir, which was located behind the pulpit, I noticed a girl that really appealed to me.
A girl with a beautiful head of dark blond hair, about my height, wearing glasses.
Wearing a choir gown, it was hard to tell about her figure, but one of her other attractions was, that she would sing a solo sometimes, and had a very angelic voice, to go with her nice glasses wearing face.
I sure would like to meet her, and get to know her, but how?
Now I realize how badly I had needed to wear glasses, and now realize how much I might have have missed.
Reading the church bulletin, I noticed that there is a young peoples get together every Tuesday night, perhaps I should go, that beautiful girl I saw in the choir, might be there.


On Tuesday night when I went to the young peoples meeting, the girl of my dreams was there.
Because, I was new member, and my first time there, was asked to tell my name and something about myself.
So I stood up and told them about myself and my family, while looking at that beautiful girl,
Later during the meeting, when everybody sat around enjoying something to drink, I managed to sit down at the table of my choice, and there she was, sitting across from me, she was looking at me with a big smile on her face.
Now I could really see her, she was wearing very attractive myopic glasses, with a prescription that looked stronger than mine, boy she is nice looking, wearing such nice framed glasses, with the kind of lenses I really like, and of course all that beautiful hair, what a perfect combination.
Well, Micheal, do you like what you see?
Sorry, I was staring at you, you are so beautiful, I heard you sing a solo in church, you have the voice of an angel.
She blushed, thank you for the compliment, I am glad to meet you, my name is Angie.
Soon we were in deep conversation, and at the end of the night, she let me escort her home, she lives not far from our house.
I managed to arrange for a date, to go and see a movie, with her on Saturday,


My Dad let me borrow his car, and when I arrived at Angie's place, she invited me in, her parents wanted to meet me, and I must have past the test, and asked me to have her home about 11.
Angie was easy to talk to, and I could not wait to tell her, how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Thank you, I always feel good when I am wearing my glasses, I like wearing them, I love the looks of 
my -5.25 lenses, and expect they most likely are going to be increased after my next eye exam, in a couple of weeks,
High prescription myopia runs in the family, as you might have noticed, my parents are both about 
-15.00, and my older brother, is -12.00, I like the looks of the strong lenses.
Well, that leaves me out, I am only in the -3.00 range.
Micheal, you look adorable wearing glasses, and I am quite sure, you likely have more increases, in your next eye exam.
We had reached the Mall, parked the car, and went to see the movie.
When we were seated, and waiting for the movie to start, I asked her if I could try her glasses.
She handed me her glasses, and I put them on, I was surprised, that I could see quite well when wearing them, Angie put my glasses on and took my face in her hand so she could see what I looked like wearing her glasses.
Oh, Micheal, you look adorable, I love the looks of your eyes behind the stronger lenses.
Well Angie, I will see, what I can do about that.
Then we switched back to our own glasses, and enjoyed the movie.
On the way home after dropping Angie off at her house, I was thrilled that, now I knew what kind of a girl she was.
She loved the looks of strong myopic lenses, I knew what to do about stronger myopic lenses.
The next day, I ordered 2 pairs of glasses, each with an diopter stronger lenses, using the prescription I have, and made sure I had the cylinder and axis right.


When my new glasses came in the mail, I rushed to my room, to try them.
I was surprised how well I could see, wearing the -4.25 glasses, but the -5.25 . glasses were a little too strong. 
I started to wear the -4.25 glasses regularly, and within a week could see everything perfect when wearing them..
My mother told me, that my glasses seemed to look stronger, 
Angie, I told her I did a real cleaning job on my glasses, that is why.


On our next date Angie, did not really notice the stronger lenses, but said, your glasses look very nice to day, what did yo do?
I told her, that now I was wearing a -4.25 prescription, I am glad you like them.
Where did you get the glasses?
I told her my story, how I had started to wear stronger glasses, to increase my myopia, and the prescription of the lenses that I am wearing now, and that I also have a pair with a -5.25 prescription,
That I will be wearing when I am really used to the -4.25 glasses, I am wearing now.
Micheal, I love that, and can't wait, to see wear the stronger glasses all the time.


A few days later Angie, phoned me, Micheal guess what, my prescription increased to -6.25 now, I am so happy.
Wait till you see me wearing my new frame, with the stronger lenses, I am sure you will love it.
Angie, my darling, I can't wait to see you, please let me know when you have your new glasses.
She was right, wearing her new glasses with the stronger lenses, which showed some nice rings, she looked fantastic.


Me dreaming, about seeing Angie, with even stronger glasses, never materialized, when I was told that she had died in a car accident.
All that I had now is her picture, on my cell phone, and great memories.
