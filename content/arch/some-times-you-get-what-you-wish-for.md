description: Geoffrey becomes fascinated with glasses, eventually getting his own and discovering the power they hold.
---
Geoffrey was a 12 year old boy, he had 2 younger sisters, Megan who was 10 and Jenny who just turned 8. They were a happy family, dad had a good job, so mom stayed home. Geoffrey liked to bike, play sports, video games and work on the computer. He was a good student going into grade 6.
He was very fascinated  with glasses. Neither of his parents wore glasses, his grand parents did, but all old people wore glasses.

He became curious about glasses 2 years ago when Karen next door started to wear glasses.
When she got her glasses she showed them to Geoffrey and she let him try them. He noticed everything looked a bit blurry, it felt different and exciting it gave you a funny feeling, he liked that. When he looked at an angle the lenses seem to make things different, and he liked the looks of her eyes behind the lenses. He noticed that at school more students were wearing glasses now.
He used his computer to get more information, and learned about myopia, presbyopia, and other interesting facts about eyes, glasses, and eye exams.
He looked at anybody wearing glasses and was soon be able to tell if a person had myopia or other problems.

When school started all the students had to see the nurse to get a vision check. Geoffrey had no trouble, but his sister Megan got a note for her parents.
Her Mother took her to get her eyes examined, and Megan came home wearing glasses, she was very proud of them as she was the only one in the family with glasses, and that  made her feel important.
She let Geoffrey try her glasses. He liked the feel of them, and noticed the lenses were about the same as Karen's. He told her she looked very nice wearing her glasses, and she gave him a big smile. He thought it would be O.K. to wear glasses, he would like to have a pair but did not need them.
At school his classmate Peter had new glasses, he asked Peter about them and he told him his prescription was -2.00 now. His old glasses were not strong enough and could see much better now.

After the spring break, each class had to get ready to do a skid for the performance on parents night. In their play Geoffrey was to be a judge he liked his role.  At the dress rehearsal the teacher did not think Geoffrey looked just right. He did not look very impressive. The teacher wondered if Geoffrey should be wearing glasses. Geoffrey said he did not have any, and I didn't know where to get them. 
Peter said: "I have my old glasses at home, and they are no good to me. I was going to get rid of them but you can have them, I will bring them in tomorrow."
The next day Peter handed Geoffrey a glasses case. 
Geoffrey opened the case and took out the glasses, he put them on and could see pretty good with them. He showed them to the teacher and he said they look perfect. "You look great."
So, Geoffrey wore Peters old glasses for the performance on parents night. The show was a success and everybody was happy. Peter did not want his old glasses back, so Geoffrey became the proud owner of his own glasses.
That night at home his parents commented on his performance, and Megan teased Geoffrey about being judge 4 eyes, but she thought he looked good wearing glasses.
Geoffrey was very happy with his glasses and nobody at home knew he had them.
He wore the glasses whenever he could, and had no trouble seeing with them, he liked the feel of them, and he thought he looked good when wearing them, and hoped he would have his own glasses to some day and he could wear all the time.

When the next school year started and all the kids had to see the nurse for their vision check, Geoffrey had no real problem, but his sister Jenny got a note to have her eyes checked.
Since Megan was due to get her eyes examined. Mom thought they all should have their eyes done. So they all went. Jenny was myopic and needed glasses, Megan had an increase in her prescription to -2.00, and Geoffrey was next to see the doctor. He was exited,  this was his first eye exam. He had some idea what to expect after watching videos on his computer. He had a bit of trouble reading the letters, but the doctor told him his eyes were healthy and would see him next year, he did not need glasses right now. Geoffrey was very disappointed, he could see better with Peter s old glasses and was sure he would end up with a low prescription,  damn, he was mad.
His sisters did not make him feel any better, they were happy with their new glasses and looked good wearing them. Geoffrey kept on wearing Peter s old glasses as much as he could.

A couple of months later Peter had new glasses again,  he told Geoffrey his prescription was now -2.75 for the right and  -3.00 for the left eye. Geoffrey asked him what he was going to do with his old glasses and if he could have them.
Peter said why do you want them? Geoffrey had to think of something, and said I like to collect old glasses for my collection. The next day Peter gave Geoffrey his old glasses for his collection.
Geoffrey could not wait to get home and try the glasses. When he put them on he noticed a difference. Everything was a little  
bit blurry, but after a short time he could see just fine.
Geoffrey liked going on long bike rides wearing his new glasses and loved them. He was glad he got used to the stronger prescription,  and he was sure if he kept wearing them, he would have a prescription after his next eye exam.

When the new school year started Geoffrey went to high school. He was feeling very good about it he liked school. 
He knew a lot of his old friends and made some new ones.
It was time for for their annual eye exam, and Geoffrey was sure he would be getting glasses now, and could hardly wait for the day of the test. His sisters were not looking forward to their test, they still liked their glasses, but did not like them on rainy days and sometimes they were hard to keep clean. Geoffrey thought that was silly, nothing was perfect, and if that was the worst he could live with that.
Geoffrey had been looking around and had some idea of the type of frames he wanted.
The day of the eye exam came. When Geoffrey had to read the letters, he had trouble with the third line and did not do well on the next one.
The doctor thought that was quite a big change since last years test and Geoffrey would have to wear glasses. His prescription was -1.75 for both eyes.
After the exam he found the perfect eyeglass frame, it was a black half  frame and his mother thought it was the perfect choice.
So, about an hour later, Geoffrey had his had his very own glasses, he was a happy guy. Everything looked nice and clear and the frames were very comfortable. When he came home everybody thought he looked great with his new glasses.
When Geoffrey went back to school he wore his glasses proudly, he felt very confident, and liked his looks.
All his classmates commented how good he looked with his glasses and he noticed quite a few girls looking at him.
He was very happy his wish had come trough and he now had his very own glasses.
