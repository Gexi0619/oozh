Emily.




My husband, James, is a medical doctor, and wears + 3.50 glasses, and has worn glasses since he was 6 yrs. old
My name is Sarah, I am a registered nurse, I have worn glasses for myopia, since grade 3.
my current prescription is in the -7.00 range.
We have been married for about 9 years, and have three sons, Lucas who is 8, and Andrew, who is 6, and Ethan who will be 5 years old, at his next birthday.
During my last pregnancy, I had had some problems, also, my glasses prescription went up 3/4 diopter.
We count our blessings, the boys are healthy, and Andrew will be starting grade one, after the summer vacation.




Because both my husband and I wear glasses, an annual eye exam is routine.
The boys think it is fun, to go for an eye exam, they are always full of questions, and comments.
and while waiting for their exam, they like to try different frames, with bold manly looks, and looking at themselves.
I noticed that Ethan, seemed to prefer, feminine, colorful frames.
When Lucas told him they were girls glasses, he told them that is what he likes.
No glasses prescribed this year, I expect they most likely need glasses in a few years.


I went shopping with Ethan, for some new clothes for him, and walked to the boys section.
When I looked for Ethan, he was in the girls section, and told me, he liked a nice pink shirt.
I was not really surprised, I had noticed before, that Ethan s choice of things was different 
Because the shirt was unisex, I bought it for him.
The next day he wore the pink shirt, and had a black scarf over his head.
When I asked him about the scarf, he told me, that was his long hair, and when he is going to wear glasses, will be a pretty girl, just like his mother.
That night, I discussed the incident with my husband, and told him I thought, it was a bit strange.
Sarah, we will have to be patient, to see if it is a fad, or that Ethan might be different.


Our neighbor friends, are Logan and his wife Audrey, they have a 5 year old, very pretty girl, Ashley.
Ethan and Ashley often play together, and always have a great time.
When I went over for a coffee, Audrey and I, got a real surprise when Ethan came in to the room wearing Ashley skirt, and high heels, and told us he is a girl now.
When we came home Ethan told me, he wants a wee wee just like Ashley, he does not like his wee wee.


Time goes fast.
At our next eye exam, both Lucas and Andrew were prescribed glasses.
Lucas is myopic, and has some astigmatism.
Andrew is farsighted like his dad, and has some astigmatism. 
They had a great time, trying to select a frame that they liked.
When we went to pick up their glasses, they were all excited.
Wearing his new glasses, Lucas they told us over and over, how happy he is, with all the tings he can now see.
Andrew is not to happy, his distance vision is fuzzy, but has been told, if he wears his glasses all the time, his vision will be better than ever.
The boys look so studious, and grown up wearing glasses, I like their new look.
Ethan is very unhappy, he wants to wear glasses to.
Since we were in the mall, I took him to a store that sells fake glasses, and he selected a pair that he wanted.
Lucas told him they were girls glasses, I know, but I am a girl, and proudly wore his fake glasses.
A few days later Ethan told me, he wanted to be called Emily, and liked his hair to grow long, he knew he was a girl, and girls have long hair.
I told him,, that he could grow his hair longer, and that Daddy and I will help him, if he wants to be a girl.


Realizing, Ethan s behavior, was not like his brothers, when they were his age, my husband arranged for an appointment, for me and Ethan with a psychologist, and a therapist.
After a long session, we were told, that both were quite sure, that Ethan is transgender, and suggested to treat him as a girl, like he wants to be, for a while, and study his reaction.


When we came home, we told Lucas and Andrew, that from now on, they were going to have a sister.
That God made a mistake, and Ethan is really a girl, and her name will be Emily.
The boys told me, they would like a sister, and would be nice to her, and not tease her.
Emily, is so proud of her new girls clothes, and happy to be a girl
I think she looks so cute. 
We decided that Emily, will be going to school, as a girl.


Before school started, it was eye exam time, Lucas had an ½ diopter increase, Andrew had a slight change in his astigmatism, and Emily was delighted when she was told she had to wear glasses, she is myopic and her right eye is -0.50, and her left -0.75.
She now proudly, wears her colorful cat eye frame.
I love her new, girly, glasses wearinglook.


When we went over for a little visit next door, Audrey could not believe her eyes.
Audrey please meet Emily, our daughter.
Of course, I had to tell her the whole story, Audrey promised to help all she could.
Sarah, liked Emily s name, and of course her new glasses.
As expected, Sarah wanted to try Emily s glasses.
When she put the glasses on, and looked around said, 
Mommy, I can see everything far away, so nice and clear, these glasses are magic, I want glasses just like that. 
Audrey, I think, with that reaction, Sarah might need to have an eye exam.
About a week later, there were two very cute looking, glasses wearing girls, ready to go to school.



About 12 years later.
--------------------------


Emily, is now in her last year of high school
She is a happy girl, and I am very proud of our daughter.
After she had finished with her puberty blockers, had started taking female hormones.
Emily, now has beautiful long hair, soft skin, and a nice girls figure, and well developed breasts. 
She proudly wears her – 6.00 glasses, and is very popular at school, where she is a cheer leader, a member of the drama club, and plays on the basketball team.
The boys like her, she has quite a few dates, and loves the school dances.
The dancing lessons, and self improvement course, that Emily has taken, sure helped her, with how to sit, walk and move like a lady.
She also took a modeling course, and loves to do fashion shows.
After graduating from high school, she is due for gender reassignment surgery.


Emily is now a real girl, and is starting university, to study journalism, and fashion design.
On weekends, she sometimes models, at local fashion shows, she prefers the ones where she shows new designs in eye wear.
At her last eye exam, her prescription read, right eye – 6.75, and her left eye – 7.00.
Since her prescription had not changed since her last exam, and she still loves wearing glasses, she now is saving her money, so she can have several different pairs of glasses in her wardrobe.




Emily s Story




During my final year of university studies, I met a very nice young man.
David, a handsome, glasses wearing guy, is finishing his degree in business and economics.
We have been dating quite a few times, and I love him.
David is also a myopic, and wears – 3.00 glasses, he had started to wear glasses when he was 15.
He has two sisters, who are in their mid teens.
David has met my family, and next weekend I am going to meet his.
Before we get any more involved, I want to tell him my secret.
I invited him for dinner, at a small Italian restaurant, and after dinner, when we were holding hands, told him my story.
I told him, I am a transgender girl, with all the girls equipment, but cannot have children
After I was finished, David said, Emily I love you for who you are, we will keep it a secret, if we want a family, we can always adopt children.
There was a lot of kissing that night, and now I am looking forward to meet David s family.


I loved the reception I received, when I met David s family, on the Friday night.
After a delicious family dinner, the girls realizing I knew a lot about fashion, were full of questions.
They asked me, how I could look so good wearing glasses.
I told them, that because we all have different shaped faces, selecting a frame is very important, and proper eye make up, accentuates your eyes..
Jenny than told me, that they were due for an eye exam on Saturday, and both hated the thoughts of having to wear glasses.
Ashley failed her drivers vision test last week, that is why, she has to go for an eye exam, and mom decided, I should have an eye exam to.
I suggested to David, that we go with the girls to the mall optical store, then I could help them, select 
the proper frames.
David s mother made it no secret, that she liked me very much, and thanked me for helping Jenny and Ashley.


When we arrived at the mall, and walked into the optical store, David told me he would catch up with us later.
While Ashley had her exam, Jenny and I looked at the frames, and after she tried some, that I had suggested, told me, if she can look that good wearing glasses, she would not mind having to wear them.
Ashley came out of the exam room, carrying her prescription.
I looked at it, and read, right eye -1.00, left eye -.0.75, and a little astigmatism.
Well, let s go, and find you an attractive frame.
It did not take us long, to select a frame, that Ashley really liked.
When Jenny came out of the exam room, she had a big smile on her face
Emily, where is the frame I liked so much, I am going to need it.
After the optician did the P.D measurements, told the girls, their glasses would be ready about noon.
We walked around the mall, and decided on some lunch at the food court.
David met us there, and heard all about the new glasses, the girls were going to wear. 


The girls were very excited, when they entered the optical store, to pick up their new glasses.
When Ashley looked at herself wearing her glasses, said, I really love how I look wearing glasses, 
thank you Emily, for all your help.
Looking around, Ashley could not believe the improvement in her vision, everything looked so nice and clear and well defined.
Jenny after looking around wearing her glasses said, I can t believe I was so blind, I can see everything
so nice and clear now, I love it.
David told his sisters, that he loved their new look.


When we all arrived back home, David s mother could not believe how good the girls looked wearing glasses, and thanked me for helping them.
That night, the girls wanted me to give them a make up lesson, but David told them, I was his to night, they would have to wait till to morrow.
David and I had a great time, we went for dinner, and dancing.
The next day, as I had promised, I gave the girls a make up lesson.
When finished, David s sisters, loved their looks so much, that they are glad now, that they have to wear glasses.


When David and I received our degrees, David started to work in his Dad s business.
I am now working at a T.V station., in the news department, and also do a lot of interviews,
and also do shows about fashions, as fill ins.
David and I plan to get married, and will have to see what the future brings.
Last weekend, when David and I were at my parents home, my mother gave us some pictures, 
showing all the changes, from ETHAN, to EMILY.
