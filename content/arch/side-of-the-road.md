description: Discovering a mysterious pair of glasses on the side of the road unlocks a thrilling new reality.
---
Ok fellow glasses lovers, here's a fantasy story for y'all. 

Ever since I can remember I've been fascinated with glasses. One day, while driving to school, I saw a purse on the side of the road. It looked clean, as if maybe it fell out of someone's car and no one noticed. I pulled over and picked up the purse. Inside, there was no I.D.,just a few makeup items and two glasses cases. Heart pounding, I opened the case and inside one of them was a pair of plastic frames with a low index and a prescription I'm guessing is about - 6. In the other case was a pair of glasses with much thinner lenses. My guess is that the low index pair is just a back- up pair. Anyways, I hurry home to try on the glasses. When I get home, I get a text from my friend Emma asking if she can come over. I told her yes, and when she arrived I showed her the glasses. She, of course, wanted to try them on too. "Wow!" She exclaimed. "These are really strong and make my head spin". I took them from her and put them on myself. My vision instantly became warped and everything appeared smaller, but I loved it. I dared Emma to wear the glasses for the rest of the night while we try to do activities with reduced visual acuity. She reluctantly agreed, and we had some fun. After about an hour, I could feel my eyes getting used to the overcorrection, and I could see fairly well with them on. Emma left around 11 pm and I went to bed with the glasses still on my face. When I woke up, everything was blurry and I freaked out until I remembered that I fell asleep with the glasses still on. Once I gave myself time to focus, I could see well with the glasses again. I checked my phone for any messages, which took some serious squinting, the small print was much harder to see rather than something farther away. As I got ready for my day I kept the glasses on, loving every second of the strain and I especially love how small my eyes appeared from behind the lenses. I wore them to school today and got a lot of comments about how they make my eyes smaller and how I must be blind. Oh, if only  knew.
