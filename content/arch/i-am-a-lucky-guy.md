I am a Lucky Guy!




I know, I am a nut, but I cannot help it.
My name is Kevin, and ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to wear glasses. 
I guess, it might be because of my parents, who both wear glasses for myopia, with prescriptions of 
about -12.00,.
Looking at my parents everyday, wearing those nice looking glasses, which I so admired, made me want to wear glasses, and I got my wish.
I was very happy when I was prescribed my first pair of glasses, when I was five years old.
Since then my myopia, has increased, every time I had my eye exam.
I always loved wearing glasses, and because there are always very few kids in my class wearing glasses, has made me feel superior and important, because I am always the one with the strongest prescription. 
When I started high school, my prescription read, OD -7.75, and OS.-7.50
I participated in many activities, and I am a good piano player, and always had always lots of friends.
Looking at faces wearing glasses, and wearing glasses, is as far as I am concerned, what makes life is so great.
I always dated girls who wore glasses, but so far have never met anyone, who has a liking for glasses the way I do, and that is the kind of girl I would like.


After finishing high school, I went to university, and studied science, to become a science teacher. 
My prescription, now reads. OD, -12.25 and OS. -12.00.and a little bit of astigmatism, and I hope my prescription will increase some more.
As before, I dated a lot of nice glasses wearing girls, but after a few dates, that was usually the end of asking them to go out with me.


I am almost finished with my studies, and after working so hard, my eyes need attention again.
When I had my eye exam, my prescription went up to OD. -13.00, and OS.-12.50, almost to 
the -14.00, I was hoping for.
I have applied for a high school teachers position, with a few school boards, and now the waiting starts.
well, I have now graduated and have my certification for a teaching position, I am ready.


I have moved to the new town, where I secured a job as a teacher.
Now what I have to do is to get settled.
I have rented a nice apartment that I like, and can afford, not to far from the school where I will be teaching.


I like to get to know more about this town, it is big enough, so there should be lots of good looking glasses wearing girls.
I like dancing, and I will have to find out where I can go.
A good place at anytime is a nice bar, and to find one that caters to single people.
To bad none of my friends live here, I certainly could use a friend right now.
I spend some time in the mall, to see what type of stores there are,
and I noticed a good size optical store, what I liked best about it, that it was located opposite from the food court.
While I was enjoying a snack, watched the people wearing glasses going in and out of the optical store, and also some around me in the food court.
There are some good looking glasses wearing girls, so enjoyable.
When I guess, the movie was finished, the food court filled up fast, and all the available seats were filling up fast.
I sat at a table for two, looking at the crowd, when a nice glasses wearing girl about my age, carrying some parcels, asked me if I would mind if she sit with me.
Sure, I don't mind, so she sat down, thank you, I have been shopping all day, and my feet are killing me.
Looking at the girls glasses, guessed, her prescription to be about -4.00, in a very nice new style.
So, I introduced myself, and told her I was new in town, and would she like something to eat or drink.
Just a regular coffee will be wonderful thank you.
When I brought her the coffee, and sat down with her, she thanked me. 
After some small talk about her shopping, and my job, I said sorry, I cannot remember your name. 
Sorry Kevin, my name is Katie, after resting for a while and drinking her coffee, she told me she was ready to go to catch the bus.
So I offered, to drive her home, which she accepted.
Katie, had to tell me where to go, and I saw a lot of the town that I had not seen before.
After we arrived at where Katie lived, I asked her if she would like to go and see a movie Saturday afternoon, she accepted my invitation, and we arranged for a time.


I was really looking forward, to my first date in my new home town.
When, I went to get Katie, she was ready, and after I assisted her to get in the car, went to the mall, to go and see a movie.
After the movie was finished, we went to the food court for some refreshments, and when we sat own to enjoy them, I mentioned how nice she looked wearing glasses, and asked her, how she liked them.
I pretty near fell of my chair, when she said I hate wearing glasses, and can't wait till next week to have lasik, and be rid of my glasses.
It did not take me long after that, to take her home.


I was in a lousy mood, there I thought I had found a nice glasses wearing girl, no such luck.
On the way home I spotted an interesting looking bar, with a sign, early bird specials.
That is what I needed, so I went in, and there were only a few customers at the bar, so I sat down.
The female bartender, wore myopic prescription glasses, which I guessed to be about -14.00, or perhaps a little higher.
I asked for a beer, and when she handed me my beer, had a good chance to look at her.
Wow, she looked good, and while sipping my beer, enjoyed looking at her.
She started some small talk, and I told her my name was Kevin, and I complimented her on her nice looking glasses.
She thanked me, my name is Emma, well I think you look pretty nice yourself wearing glasses.
Well, Kevin, I love wearing, my nice high prescription glasses.
Am I right your prescription is about -14.00
No, Kevin, you are wrong, my right eye, is -15.25, and my left, -15.75.
Well you got me beat, I am not -14.00 yet, but would not mind if I was, -14.00 or higher.
Conversation after that was a pleasure, at last I found my type of girl, now how to catch her.


I became a regular customer, for a beer and some pub food, and to talk and look at Emma.
One night, on my way home from the pub, stopped at a small variety store, to get some treats.
The owner, tried very hard for me to buy a lottery ticket, but knowing the odds, refused.
When finished shopping, I paid the bill and was on my way.
Unpacking the bag of goodies, I found a lottery ticket, and when I checked the bill, realized
I had not paid attention, and given the guy the money he had asked for, and now I have a lottery ticket, that I really did not want, so I put the ticket in my wallet.


After teaching at school, I usually ended up in my favourite bar, to talk with Emma.
One afternoon, I asked Emma for a date, which she accepted.
We went for dinner, the restaurant we went to was a bit old fashioned, but very cozy.
An old fashioned jukebox, was available and a small space to dance.
The meal was delicious, and after dinner we danced, so romantic
Emma told me that she would love to see something like this, where she works.
We had a lovely romantic evening, and decided we would do it again.


The next time I took Emma out for dinner, she told me that her boss was putting the place up for sale.
and told me she would like to buy it, she loved the place, but wondered how she could manage.
We discussed it some more, and enjoyed our night out.


A few days later, I heard on the radio, that there was a lucky winner in town, on last nights lottery draw.
Remembering the ticket I got, wishfully started to look for the ticket in my wallet, after I found it, took it to the place where I had bought it.
When in the store, I checked the ticket to the winning numbers.
I almost fainted when I realized, I had the winning ticket for the second prize.
After checking with the store owner, about the amount I won, realized I now could fulfill my dream.
I went to see Emma, and bought two drinks, and asked her to sit with me for a moment.
When we had our drink, I proposed to her to marry me,
She with a big smile on her face accepted, and then I told her about my winning ticket, and if she wanted we could buy the bar.
Silly boy, you know I love this bar almost as much as I love you.


Not long after, Emma and I were the owners of the house, where the bar was.
Before we did anything else, we were married, in a simple ceremony.
Now the fun started, planning any changes we wanted to make to our bar.
We purchased the building next to the bar, so we could expand, we wanted a place where our customers, could enjoy either eating, drinking and dancing.


With the assistance of a consultant, it did not take us very long to have everything arranged the way we 
wanted it.
Because both of us like the look of glasses, we decided that every patron that wore glasses, would receive a 10% discount.
Anybody who did not wear glasses, could rent a pair from the hostess, either with a -1.00 or +1.00
prescription.
We had made an arrangement with the optical store next door, to supply us.
One of the teachers that I worked with is gay, and I asked him to encourage gay and lesbians to 
come, to our place, for dinner and dancing.


After we reopened the bar, with all of our serving staff wearing glasses, both Emma and I sure enjoyed looking at all the glasses wearing staff and patrons.
On the first day, we ran out of glasses, for the customers
You would not believe the number of people who had borrowed our glasses, and told us after, that they could see better when wearing the glasses, so we referred them to the optical shop next door.
We realized our venture sure paid of, we were busy, and not many people refused to wear glasses.
Well I can't believe my luck, finding the ideal glasses wearing girl, and after winning in the lottery,
having the time of my life, looking at all those beautiful glasses wearing people in our pub, and most 
of all my beautiful glasses wearing wife, I am a Lucky Guy!
