description: After Anne gets reading glasses, she and Tony explore their growing intimacy and assist each other.
---
My beautiful nurse 

It was now a week since Anne had got her reading glasses 
She said that all the pain had gone from her eyes now,but when I sugested maybe I stop putting the drops in her eyes,she looked a little sad.
“If you don't mind I think it better if you put them in for another week,it feels so nice when you do it Tony”
I had to admit I did enjoy touching her blind eye and seeing her TOTALY helpless without her glasses on.
She picked up her cane and tapped her way into the bathrooms then when she returned she handed me the bottle and said “Will you take my glasses off for me tonight,I won't feel as ugly if you take them off for me,
I could feel her trembling as I took them off.
It was as if she was naked without them.
She just stood there waiting for me just holding her cane
I wheeled my self across to her,my legs were getting stronger now so I managed to lift myself from my chair,we were both breathing heavily as I touch her blind eye.
We both wanted so much more but I did not have the strength or courage yet.
I told Anne how beautiful she looked and there was no need for her to wear a prosthetic eye again
After I had put her drops in I slowly put her glasses back on and we just held each other.
That evening Anne went to bed early so I just laid back in my chair and smoked my pipe alone thinking of Anne and what might be.

A week later my sister rang and said could we look in her room and cupboards for a ring that her mother had given her,as mother was asking why she was not wearing it.
I was now able to get up the stairs with the aid of a walking stick.
Anne had just got dressed,so she offered to help me.
“”Do you think your sister wants all these old glasses or shall we give them to  Robert to send to Africa”
I'm sure they can all go,I will get a box to put them all in.
When I returned Anne was now wearing a pair of my sisters old glasses that had a black lens in. “What  do you think,would you rather I wore a pair like this to cover my missing eye.
I looked at Anne and said “No I think you look prettier and more sexy not covering your missing eye”.
I know you not like the different thickness of your lens,so if you want I'm sure Robert would make the same thickness for your blind eye.
“That would be wonderful Tony,you are so kind to me I never thought a man would ever say I looked beautiful,especially with my eye missing and not wearing that very uncomfortable prosthetic. 
We tipped all the things from the draws out and onto the bed,this was easier for Anne to see to help me sort it all out.most of it we put into black bin bags.
Then Anne said “were these your mother's”.
Without looking at Anne I said “my mother never lived here,why are you asking that”
“I just wondered who these belonged to”
“O they were my sisters,I don't know what to do with them,they still work I think,but they are no use to her now.there is a packet of batteries over there as well put them together I will ask Robert were to send them.
“Is this were the batteries go” Anne asked.
Anne sounded all excited .Suddenly,what had seemed a boring job for her changed,
“Tony can I try them please please Tony”.
“There was a girl at my school that wore hearing aids and I always wished I could try them,she had so many boys wanting to sit next to her and help her”.
“Please put them in for me Tony”
“O Tony that's so nice you touching me your hands are so gentle,why can't I hear as much now I thought hearing aids helped you hear better”.
“I have not turned them on dear I thought you just want me to put them in for you”
“Please turn them on for me Tony I want to know how it feels to hear with them,
“Wow everything is so much louder and clearer,hand me my cane please I want to go to the bathroom and look at them.
“Ok put them in the box for Robert when you done,I'm going downstairs now.
An hour later Anne came down and asked if she should make our meal now,I was busy reading the paper and just said yes please what have you been doing You have been a long time.
“Just tiding things away” Was the reply.
The meal is ready Anne said.
I alway sit on the other side of the table to her,as it's easier than her having to  look sideways out her one eye.
Anne seemed extra talkative tonight and bubbly,as she got up to get the second course I notice she was still wearing the hearing aids,I just smiled to my self and said nothing.
When we had finished our meals Anne  loaded the dishwasher and said “is it ok 
if I go to my room early tonight I want to read a book,it's so nice seeing to read now”
“I thought we would go to Roberts early tomorrow morning and take all my sisters old glasses,we could have breakfast in the cafe next to his shop”.
“That's a good idea” Anne said
“Can we take my distance glasses with us as well the screw has come out the arm has fallen off”

The next morning I was ready first,Anne had not come downstairs when the taxi arrived.she called down to me and asked me to bring the box down with my sisters old glasses in and her distance glasses that were in the case beside her bed.
As I was about to go upstairs Anne came down ,she pick up her cane and made her way to the door
After we had had breakfast at the cafe we went to see Robert.
We gave him the box of my sisters glasses and Anne showed him her broken glasses.
“O dear it needs a new arm I'm afraid that's why the screw has come out,leave 
them with me and I will get them fixed for you”.
“If you take your scarf off I will adjust your reading glasses that you are wearing they look to be slipping down a little”
Robert looked at Anne,”i did not know you wore hearing aids, they are rather old models you must have been wearing them from a very young age,
I turned and looked shocked ,Anne was still wearing my sisters hearing aids.
“O I used to be to shy to wear them,but Tony is so kind to me. 
When he saw them yesterday he put them in for me so I have decided I should wear them all the time now.
Anne turned and smiled at me 
Robert looked at the moulds,”Well in that case you better go upstairs and get the lady to take impressions of you ears and get new moulds made for you they look a little yellow now, You must have had the ear pieces for a long time””
“We have a special offers on hearing aids next month, maybe then Tony will buy you a new pair”.
“Thank you, I can hear so much better wearing them,I have to thank Tony if he not put them in for me I would never have had the courage to wear them again,
I just looked and said”it's nice she can hear better now””

When we got home Anne helped me onto the settee, and sat next to me,she as she started to kiss me her hearing aids were whistling, she looked at me,”Can  I get your pipe out and help you fill it,I'm looking forward to smoking tonight, I want to keep my reading glasses on and my hearing aids in so I can see you better 
I'm sure I will enjoy smoking even more when I see you looking happy”.
She slowly lifted my pipe  and put it in her mouth ,then she gently rubbed the bowl as she filled it.then light it and started sucking.
After she had finished we both just laid there together,

That was so much nicer than smoking my pipe on my own.
