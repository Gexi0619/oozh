Was it Bad Luck, or Good Luck?

I crested the hill on my way into town and saw a younger looking lady walk on to the road from a driveway ahead of me and turn towards the village.  She started to walk briskly, and I thought it likely she was only walking for exercise.  I pulled up beside her and rolled down my window.

“Are you walking because you want to walk, or are you walking because you need to get somewhere?” I asked.

“My car has a flat tire, and I am going to be late for work,” came the reply.

“I’m going through the village and on into town, so I can give you a ride.” I said.

She turned to walk towards me and I couldn’t believe my eyes. I had noticed that she was wearing glasses, but had no idea that they might be reasonably strong ones. The full frontal view showed me that she had a lot of the cut in on both sides of her face that indicated a pretty strong prescription. She crossed the road, and got in on the passenger side.

“Where can I drop you?” I asked.

“I work at the Sunrise Café, just around the corner from the hardware store.” She replied.

I stop there frequently, but had never spotted a girl wearing strong glasses there before. I took another look at her, trying to picture her without glasses. Then it came to me.

“Katherine.” I said.

“That’s right. I think I have served you before.” Katherine said.

“It took me a minute or two to recognize you wearing glasses.” I answered.

“Yeh, well I didn’t have any choice. I ripped one of my contacts this morning and I didn’t have a replacement. Then my car had a flat, and it slipped off the jack when I was trying to put on that stupid little spare.  It hasn’t been a good day so far.” Katherine told me.

“Doesn’t sound like a good start.  Hopefully you won’t have the third strike today.” I replied.

“Like I need any more bad luck!” Katherine exclaimed.

I turned in to the little plaza and parked in front of the restaurant.  Katherine got out, and I followed her to the door, pulling it open for her.

“Were you coming here anyway?” Katherine asked.

“I often stop by for a coffee to go for my drive into town.” I answered.

“Well this one will be on me. Just let me hang up my jacket and wash my hands first.” Katherine answered

“What time are you off work?” I asked as she handed me my coffee.

“3 o clock. Why?” Katherine queried.

“I should be coming back from town around then. I could stop by, pick you up and change your tire for you.” I answered.

“I can probably call my boyfriend, but he won’t be off until 5. Or I can walk home, but if you don’t mind….” Katherine answered leaving it hanging for my reply.

“No, I don’t. My wife won’t have supper ready until after 5 anyway.  I will be here at 3.” I said.

I didn’t think she would have taken my concern for her well being as anything more than it was – just a friendly gesture. After all, she appeared to be around 28, and I am 67.  Would my gesture have been anywhere near as friendly or helpful if she hadn’t been wearing such a nice minus prescription?  You know it wouldn’t. I had seen her a number of times in the restaurant and without glasses she hadn’t attracted me at all.

I managed to kill enough time in town that I was able to get back to the restaurant to pick Katherine up by 3. I took her home, and I managed to get the jack out from under the car. Then I blocked it up and jacked it up properly. I put on the spare, and she thanked me very much.  As I drove away I must say I wished I was 30 again.

The following day I stopped in at the restaurant for lunch. Katherine served me, and she was wearing her glasses again.

“No contacts yet I see.” I stated the obvious.

“I have to go in after work and order them.  It will probably take a couple of days for them to come in though. I better get them soon though, because my boyfriend doesn’t like me wearing glasses.” Katherine answered.

“Well girl, you had better get another boyfriend then. You look hot wearing glasses, and there are tons of guys around who would be attracted to you.” I replied.

“Do you really think so?” Katherine asked.

“I know so. Your glasses look like jewelry on your face, and add to your attractiveness.” I said.

“I have never thought of it that way. I have always hated my poor eyesight and my thick glasses. I got contact lenses when I was 15 and have never worn glasses out on a date.” Katherine replied.

“Just a word of caution for you. You have poor eyesight and require glasses or contacts to see.  If your boyfriend doesn’t like you wearing glasses when you are young and vibrant, how will he possibly be able to like you wearing glasses when you are a young mother with 2 or 3 kids to look after, and no time to put in your contacts?  I suggest that you start to look for another boyfriend.” I replied.

Katherine looked at me with a thoughtful expression on her face, but didn’t say any more.  I paid my bill, left her a tip and went on my way.  For the next couple of months I stopped by for coffee once in a while, especially when I saw her car there. She appeared to be wearing glasses about half the time, and contacts the other half.

Then I didn’t see her car there anymore. And it didn’t show up at the house at the top of the hill either.  I wondered what had happened, so I stopped by the restaurant.  One of the other girls told me that Katherine had split with her boyfriend and had moved to the city.

I had told Katherine that bad luck comes in 3’s. I wonder if she would consider having met me that day as bad luck, or good luck.
