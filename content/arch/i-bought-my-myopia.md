I bought my myopia.


My name, is Kevin, I am now in grade 3.
I have a desire to wear glasses, why?
Well, I like the looks of glasses, the nice looking lenses, fascinate me.
Nobody in our family, wears glasses, except my grand parents.
I envy, every student, in our school who wears glasses.


This past weekend, when my mothers sister family came to visit,
my nephew, who is about my age, is wearing glasses now.
When I looked at him, I noticed that, when I looked through the edges of his lenses, everything looked smaller and farther away.
I liked that, I want to wear glasses, with lenses like that.
When we played some games, I asked him how he liked wearing glasses, he told me he hates, having to wear glasses.
He let me try his glasses, and I hated, to give the glasses back to him,
I loved the feel of the glasses, on my face, and the chance to look through lenses
Now, I am really sure, I want to wear glasses.


My father, gave me his old computer, and I like to read all about glasses and lenses, and now know, I want to be myopic.
I also found out, that when you are myopic, you have to wear your glasses for the rest of your life.
That does not bother me, I want to wear glasses.
Now, how to go about it, at my last eye exam, the doctor told me, Kevin, your eyes are nice and healthy, that meant no glasses for me.


I will have to get hold, of some glasses, and wear them, I might become myopic that way.
We now, have a new student in our class, Patrick, he wears glasses, I can tell, he is myopic, and by the looks of his lenses, has been wearing glasses for a while.


Patrick, lives on our street, so we soon walked together, to and from school.
I found out, that Patrick likes playing video games, and other activities that I like.
Now we are at each others house, playing games, and are becoming friends. 


Patrick, often, complains to me, that he is out of money, and wants to borrow some, and I usually help him out, and give him the money.


To day, when Patrick, was at my place, I noticed, he was wearing new glasses, 
I see you are wearing new glasses.
How did you know?
Well, your lenses, look different, and your glasses frame, is so nice and shiny.
Yes, I got my new glasses yesterday, and my prescription, increased, which I like, because I want to wear glasses as strong as my parents, I like wearing glasses.
How come, you always wear the same frame?
I like the way I look, that is why, aim alwaysget, the same type of frame.
Patrick, what do you do with your old glasses?
I save them, I now have 3 pair, in my dresser drawer.
Can I see them?
Why?
Because I like glasses, and I want to wear glasses.
Patrick, took the glasses out of the drawer, this was my first pair, When I put the glasses on, and looked around, I noticed, that the lenses were not very strong and I could see reasonably well.
Can I see you next pair?
Here they are, so I put the glasses on, and sure noticed a big difference, when looking around, I sure could not see to well.
Patrick, can I have these glasses?
No, I want to keep them.
Can I buy the glasses?
H,. m m.. m how much do you give me?
Well, you owe me 5 bucks, will that do?
O. K. You can have the glasses.
Now, I am the proud owner of a pair of glasses, which I hope, will help me become myopic.


I wore the glasses, every chance I got, and after about a week, could see reasonably well, when wearing the glasses.
I started to wear the glasses at school, and now, can see everything, nice and clear.
Lately, I am starting to notice, everything in the distance is now looking a bit fuzzy,, when I take my glasses off.


About a month later, I was able to buy, Patrick’s other pair of glasses. 
It sure, did not take me long, to see perfectly wearing the stronger prescription.
Now, I am noticing that my vision, without wearing the glasses, is not very good, and I think my mother must have noticed something, because, I now have an appointment for an eye exam.


I was all excited, going for my eye exam, will I be prescribed to wear glasses, am I myopic now?
The optometrist, was surprised to see, that I was quite myopic now, and told my mother, to make sure, I wear my glasses all day long.
My prescription, read, right eye -2.25, and left eye – 2.00.
I selected, the same type of frame, as I have been using, so I can wear, my stronger glasses, and try to become, even more myopic.


After my next exam, my prescription was in the -3.00 range, which, is almost the same as Patrick’s, what now?
Well, nature took over, and when I went to high school, I was in 
the -4.00 range.
I like the looks of my new lenses, witch now show some rings.
With a lot of close work, I most likely will increase my myopia some more.


When I started high school, I was close to wearing – 5.00 lenses.
I am so proud of my glasses, and I am looking forward to continue my regular increases.
When I finished high school, I had reached the – 7.00 range.


Now that I have a job in the real world, I notice every person who wears glasses, and I like to guess, what their prescription might be.
Most of the young women these days, when they are myopic, look to me in the low myopic, - 3.00 range.
I have no idea what the prescription strength is when they wear
+ lenses in their glasses, I guess, that is because I have always preferred myopic lenses.




To day, I hit the jackpot, I noticed a beautiful redheaded girl, with a great figure, who wore the strongest, glasses for myopia., that
I have ever seen
To me they looked like myodics, but I am not sure.
I noticed her entering a coffee shop, so I followed her in.
I was real lucky, the place was busy, and there was only one small table left, where she sat down.
I slowly walked over to her table, and asked, if she would mind me sitting with her.
She looked at me, then smiled, and said, yes please sit down.
I sat down, and introduced myself. 
Kevin, I am Ashley, glad to meet you.
I asked her what she would like to drink, and placed the order.
Sitting there, all excited, looking at Ashley, who was looking through the strongest lenses, I had ever seen.
Ashley, you look beautiful, you look so nice, and I love the looks of your glasses.
She smiled, Kevin , I am glad you like my glasses, because I love my glasses.
I could not believe it.
You mind, if I ask you, how many diopters of myopia, your glasses are?
The prescription in these glasses, is – 22.00.
How can you see without wearing your glasses, I am only – 7.50,
and have some idea, what vision without wearing your glasses is like.
I have no problem at all, I am used to it.
Meeting a girl, with strong glasses, who likes wearing glasses, is a real catch, so I arranged, for a date with her, on Saturday night, to go and see a movie.


What a shock, I got, when a glasses wearing girl, who looked very much like Ashley, opened the door.
Are you Kevin?
Yes I am.
Ashley will be a few minutes, my name is Amber, I am her younger sister.
I could not believe my eyes, Amber looked almost identical to Ashley, except her glasses, which to me looked like about – 5.00.
Not long after. Ashley came, I am sorry, I made you wait, I had a problem, getting my contacts in.
That’s fine, I enjoyed talking to Amber.
Getting her contacts in, I am confused , contacts, when wearing glasses, with a -22.00 prescription.


After thinking about it for a minute, I realized, Ashley is wearing glasses over contact lenses
I don’t mind, I love the looks of those strong glasses.


When I asked her, if she wore glasses over contacts, she asked me how did you know?
Well you told me, that you had trouble putting your contact lenses in,
and after thinking about that, realized you might be doing g.o.c. 


You might as well know, I am an optician, and I love wearing glasses, but doing g.o.c. is such a fantastic experience.
I am glad you are enjoying your g.o.c. , I love the look of you wearing the strong glasses.
I am like you are, I love wearing glasses, the stronger the better.


We had a great time, watching part of the movie, because she sure is a good kisser.


After a few more dates, Ashley, fitted me with contact lenses, and showed me how to inset, and remove the lenses, and gave me some --8.00 lenses to wear, which were stronger than my prescription, 
but gave me perfect vision. 
Ashley, and I are now doing g.o.c. together, and love it when
I wear – 20.00 lenses.


The two glasses lovers, married and went on their honeymoon, doing g.o.c. all day long.
While sitting enjoying a nice drink, and looking at the scenery,
I told Ashley, that the best value I ever received for my money, was when I bought my myopia, for 5 bucks.
