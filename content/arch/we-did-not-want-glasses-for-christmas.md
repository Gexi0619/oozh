We did not want glasses, for Christmas.


My husband, Jim and I have a young family, a girl named Vicki, then Logan, and our youngest boy Kevin.
We are fortunate, they are all healthy youngsters, who enjoy sports and all outdoor activities.
We are very proud, how well they have been doing in school, they all are good students..
They all are growing, and Vicki is almost as tall as me, and starting to develop in all the right places


It is now the end of November, and the children are already, starting to get excited, I am looking forward, to see their progress reports, to see how well they are doing in school, they are now due, to be send out.


This weekend, we took our family out, to see a Christmas movie, Vicki was not happy, with where we were seated, she wanted to sit closer to the screen, and told us, the picture was fuzzy, I have no idea why, nobody else was complaining.


The following Monday, the report cards came, Vicki 's was certainly, not as good as I had expected, Logan's report, also was not good, I asked him why, and he told me, he does not like his new teacher, all he does is , make you read, and I don't like it, because I am a slow reader.
Thank goodness Kevin's report was good.


That night I discussed it with my husband, he told me, that he expected, that both Vicky and Logan possibly, could have a vision problem, at work, some of my co-workers mention, that some of their children are wearing glasses now, it seems, that now, more children with vision problems, at a younger age.


The next day, I asked Vicki, to look across the street, to see if she could read the house number of her friend Amy.
Mother that is too far away, nobody can see that far, I can, said Logan, it is number 83. thank you Logan.
I now know, that my husband is right, she might have a vision problem, I better make an appointment for her, to get her vision checked.
When I phoned the optical store, they suggested that all my children, should have an eye exam, and why, so I agreed, and all three are in for a surprise..
When they came home from school, I told them that on Wednesday, all three are going to have an eye exam, Vicky protested, and told me that she did not need an eye exam, her vision was perfect, well dear I have made an appointment, so I think we better go.

When we all arrived at the optical store, I decided that Logan, has his eye exam first, which he did not mind, so he and I went into the examination room. 
The optometrist, explained to me, everything that she did, believe it or not, I never had an eye exam, and I had no idea, what was involved.
The optometrist told me that Logan, was farsighted and had some astigmatism and should wear his glasses all the time, it would improve his reading, and help him with his schoolwork.
I was really surprised, that Logan had a vision problem, when we went back to the store part, and I gave the optician, Logan's prescription, and I asked her to look after him, while I took Kevin in, who to my surprise was also hyperopic, and had some astigmatism, and needs to wear glasses.
When Kevin and I went to see, the optician, Logan was mad at his sister, because she was teasing him, and had called him, four eyes.
I send Vicky, into the examination room by herself, so I could look after the boys, 
with selecting a frame for the glasses, they were going to wear.
Both Logan and Kevin told me, that they like the looks of themselves, when they were trying different glasses frames.
When Vicky, came out of the examination room, she was furious, she did not want to wear glasses, and that the optometrist had told her, she should wear her glasses all the time.
While, she was trying to find a frame, to suit her taste, her friend Amy, came in for an eye exam.
When Vicky complained to her, about having to wear glasses, Amy told her, she was looking forward to get glasses, so she could see properly, and that now with both of them wearing glasses, there would be eight students in their class wearing glasses, that is was no big deal, anymore. 
At last, all of them were satisfied, with their choice of frame, and after the optician had taken all the measurements, we were told the glasses would be ready in about an hour.
We all went to a pizza store, to have our lunch, and wait for the glasses to be ready.
The boys were excited, they liked the idea of having to wear glasses, Vicky did not.
After a good lunch, we went back to the optical store.
The optician told us, that all our glasses were ready.
It did not take Logan very long, to walk around, wearing his new glasses, proud as a peacock and then complained to the optician, that everything in the distance looked fuzzy, so she told him, to wear the glasses all the time for 2 weeks, and his distance vision, would not be fuzzy anymore.
Kevin, could not stop looking at himself, in a mirror.
When Vicky put her glasses on, and looked around, could not believe, how nice, and defined everything looked, and on the way home, she noticed, that trees have leaves, and would not stop telling us, about all that she can see now.
I had talked to the optician, when she handed me all the prescriptions, and she had explained them to me, I now knew what the figures meant, and then I had made appointments for eye exams, for my husband, and myself.


Vicky phoned Amy, that night, and Amy told her, that she also, has to wear glasses, we will surprise the all to morrow, that now there will be two more girls in our class, wearing glasses
Now Vicky, is not as worried, about going to school, wearing her glasses, the boys could not care less, they both like their glasses.
I could not believe, how well they all adjusted to wearing their glasses, and I am now, getting used to seeing them all wearing glasses
Now it is my turn, I have an eye appointment this morning, this is going to be my very first eye exam, I am glad, I know what the procedure is, I certainly do not know what to expect.


At my eye exam, I was prescribed glasses, but I certainly had not expected to
be prescribed bi-focal glasses.
My husband was prescribed glasses, he was becoming hypreropic.
Now we all wear glasses, and when the children mentioned, what they would like for Christmas, I kept on telling them, that they now have their glasses, and that is their Christmas present.
They all say, I did not want glasses for Christmas, we want a real present.
Well I guess I will have to talk to Santa.
