Now, that I wear glasses, I can see the real world.


I am, in my last year of high school.
How I got this far, I don t know, all my grades are low, I am usually very tired, when I have time to start studying.
Another problem I have, is when taking notes, from the information, on the blackboard, I have trouble reading them.
My daily routine, is to make, breakfast for my father, and send him off to work.
I eat my breakfast, pack a lunch for myself, check, on my mother, who is always in bed, to see if she needs anything, and go to school.
After school, I go home, check on my mother, do some housework, and make supper for my dad, who comes home, about, six-thirty, usually, half drunk, after stopping at the pub, on his way home.
My mother, I found out, is high on drugs, most of the time, she does not eat much, and stays in bed all day.
After, cleaning up, and all the other work is done, I try to study.

This morning, when I, went to check on my mother, noticed, that during the night, she had died.
I phoned 911, to find out, what to do.
The police came, and an ambulance, and when I phoned my dad, to tell him, he said, good, she sure cost me a lot of money.
After the ambulance, took the body away, a police woman, suggested, I contact my relatives.
There is only one relative, I have ever heard off, she is my my mother s older sister, I have heard about her, but I never met her.
All I know, she lives, on the other side of the country, about 4000 kilometers away..
After searching for a while, I found her phone number and called her.
It took aunt Margaret, a while, before she realized, who I was.
She asked, about my dad, and after I told her, she said I will make arrangements to come.
She called me back, and told me, she would arrive at our airport, about noon the next day. 
I gave her, our address, so she could take a taxi, from the airfield, because, we did not have a car, to go and get her.


I opened the door, and there she was, a most attractive, well dressed, glasses wearing lady.
She came in, put her arms around me, and said, I am aunt Margaret, and I am glad to meet you Nancy, 
I am so sorry, to hear about all your troubles..
What a pleasant person, to talk to, and I have never in my life, had a hug, like that.
My dad came home for supper, drunk, as usual.
After supper, aunt Margaret, told me to come, and stay with her, at the hotel.
My dad protested, what about my breakfast?
Well, my aunt said, get up early enough, and you can buy it, on your way to work, and do the same for your supper


Aunt Margaret drove a rental car, and asked me for directions to the hotel.
I am not used to riding in a car, and side streets and intersections, seem to be there, before I could see them.
Nancy, I think, you have a vision problem, did you ever had an eye exam?
No, I never had an eye exam., I have no problem reading, I can see pretty good, only things far away, look hazy.
I, will make sure, you have an eye exam, as soon as possible.
When we arrived at the hotel, she escorted me to her room.
I had never seen, a room as big and nice before, two large beds, a big T.V. and a large window.
Aunt Margaret, told me, I could watch T.V., while she made a couple of phone calls.
I am not very familiar with T.V., we never had one, and it took me a while, to find a program, I liked.
After a while, when aunt, Margaret, had finished her phone calls, asked me, if I would like to go home with her, and live at their place.
We have lots of room, and you can finish high school there.
So, I asked her, what about my dad?
He can look after himself, or find a girl friend, my husband, and I think, it will be better for you, living with us, our two sons, are married, we have lots of room, and we would love you, to come and live with us.
That, was an easy choice for me, and I walked over to her, gave her a hug, and thanked her, I am sure everything will be much better for me, at your place.

Nancy, do you have to sit, that close to the T.V. to see it? 
Yes, I do, if I sit further away, the picture becomes fuzzy.
I was sure, you were nearsighted, but I did not realize, it was this bad.
My aunt went over to her suitcase, and came back with a glasses case.
Nancy, I like you, to try these glasses, so, I put them on.
This is the first time in my life, I tried glasses.
I looked, around, and could not believe, that I could see everything so much better, when wearing the glasses.
I walked over to the window, and looked outside, and could see everything, nice and clear. 
I moved the frame, up, and then down, to see with, and without lenses, and could not believe wearing glasses, could improve your vision like that.
Nancy, you are now, wearing, my spare glasses, 
While watching you, I was sure, you are about, as myopic, as I am.
If you want, and feel comfortable wearing the glasses,, you can wear them, till you get your own
Before we went out, she showed me how to use some make up.
I sure look different now, glasses and make up, I don t think, my dad would recognize me.


We went to the mall, and my aunt, made an early morning appointment, to get my hair done. 
I can t believe, somebody will be doing my hair.
At the optical shop, she made an appointment for 11, o clock, and while we were there, she wanted me to try some frames, to see which frame, would look best on me.
Then, we went to some clothing stores, there my aunt, bought me a couple of dresses, new underwear, and a nice coat.
Carrying, all my parcels, we went back, to the hotel.
Still wearing, my aunts glasses, I really enjoyed being able to see so well, and I am all excited, and looking forward to, what tomorrow might bring..

The next day, was, a whole new experience
Wearing my new clothes, we went. to the hotel dining room, and I can t believe, ordering what you like, and somebody brings it to you, and having your coffee and tea refilled.
Next stop was at the hair dressers.
My aunt talked, to the girl, who was going to look after me, I took the glasses off, wow everything looked fuzzy now.
After, what seemed like ages, the girl, told me, I am finished, have a look at yourself.
I put the glasses back on, and looked in the mirror.
Was that me? I could not believe my new look, my hair was shorter, curled, and in some areas a little different color, what a change, I sure liked my new look.
Next stop, the optical store.
Another new experience, an eye exam.
The optometrist, wondered , how I had been able to function, without wearing glasses, with the prescription that she handed me.
Aunt Margaret, wanted to see my prescription.
Your prescription, is stronger, than the glasses, you are wearing now.
Right eye -2.75, left eye – 3.00, and very little astigmatism.
Aunt Margaret, seems to know so much, about fashion, and everything else, that I listened , and agreed to all her suggestions , 
She ordered me two pair of glasses, so I would have a spare pair, if needed.
When the glasses were ready, and I put them on, realized how much stronger they were, than, the ones I had been wearing.
I still, cannot believe, it is me, when I look in the mirror, nice hair, a little make up, and my new glasses wearing look.

Aunt Margaret, looked after the funeral arrangements, and other details, and I said good bye to my dad, who was very upset, about me leaving.
I still wondered, who was going to look after him?
My aunt told me, not to worry about him, your dad can look after himself.

The next day, I went for my first plane ride, I thought, we never get there, it took so long.
When we were getting our luggage, a glasses wearing young man approached us.
Hello, mother, I see you brought us the sister, we always wanted.
Hello David, after mother and son hugged each other, she said, David, meet Nancy.
Then David, gave me a big hug, glad to meet you Nancy.
I could not believe, how welcome, I felt.
David, looked after our suitcases, and then drove us, to my new home.

I really enjoyed the car ride, I could not believe a city this big, the tall buildings, and the big highways.
We seemed to be leaving the city, and I loved the view, of the rolling landscape, and I also noticed, some, snow capped, mountains, in the distance.
David, told me, I was looking at the Rocky mountains ,we will take you there and show you around, in the winter we go skiing there.
Now I really, appreciate wearing glasses, and be able to see all this beautiful scenery.

We turned, and going down the driveway, looked at a large, house, with a three car garage.
Well, we are home, Nancy.
After entering, the house, which looked to me like a castle, I was shown, to my bedroom.
A large room, with windows facing the mountains, I felt like Cinderella,, now living in a palace. 


The next day, after I was settled, my new mother, took me shopping, and to the eye doctor the family uses, because she wanted to make sure, I wore the right prescription.
He prescribed, a ½ diopter increase, on both eyes, and wanted to see me again, in about 6 months.
I now wear my new glasses, and sure notice a big improvement, in my vision.


The next day, the school bus stopped to pick me up, so I could finish, my last year in high school.
I enjoyed the ride on the bus, I met some very pleasant girls, and felt very comfortable.
In class, I sure noticed, the difference wearing glasses made, thank God for glasses.
I had no trouble, with any of my courses, to finish the year, and I graduated with honors.
My new parents, brothers and their families, are very proud of me, and I sure feel right at home.


After a summer, of sightseeing, picnics, and barbeques, I really got to know my new family.
After, I was shown, the business that my new father owned, I was very impressed. 
My two new brothers are working there, and they suggested, I take a business course, so I can join them.
After the summer break, I started my business and accounting course, and really enjoyed it.


Three years later, after graduating, I started in the family business.
After my last eye exam, I was told, that it looked like my vision, had stabilized, at -3.75, for my right,
-4.00 for my left eye.
l, love wearing glasses, and realize, that after starting to wear glasses, found out what the real world was like.
