description: A teenager discovers the world of glasses and realizes there's more to vision than meets the eye.
---
My name is Jenny, I am 18 years old and in my last year of high school.
I have 2 brothers,Dave and Jim , who are in university.
Jim and Dave both wear glasses ,there glasses have the type of lens that makes your eyes look bigger.
I certainly hope I never have to wear glasses like that, I don t like them.
Dave cam home last weekend  and brought his new girlfriend Megan.
She is a very pretty blond haired girl and she wears glasses.
The lenses in her glasses make her eyes look a little smaller, but so nice and clear, they seemed to sparkle.
As soon as I saw her, I knew there was something special about her.I liked her very much
When I had a chance to talk to her how I loved her glasses , and how nice she looked wearing them
She thanked me, and told me she loved wearing glasses.
I mentioned that her lenses looked so much nicer than the ones her brothers were wearing.
She told me her brothers were hypropic and wear lenses that magnified, and she was myopic
and had lenses that minimized.
One thing I know for sure, If I have to wear glasses, I hope I will be myopic.
Megan smiled and asked me if I would like to try her glasses?
When I put the glasses on, was surprised I could see when wearing them,everything  looked a little fuzzy.
How do i look wearing glasses?
Megan told me I had a face made to wear glasses, and that i looked fantastic. 
When I looked in the mirror, could not believe how good I looked.
When I gave the glasses back to Megan, she mentioned that if I could see wearing her glasses might 
be a little myopic.

I now realized how little I knew about vision and glasses, even when everyone in our house wore glasses except me,
I had never given glasses any thought,
I used my computer , and learned about the difference  between nearsighted and farsighted
The type of lenses that were prescribed  to correct that particular vision problem.
Now I understood why my brothers wore glasses with lenses that magnified, and why Megan  lenses minimized. , and why lenses looked so different.  ,
I became very aware  and interested in glasses now, and started to take notice of every person wearing glasses.
I tried to figure out , if they were near or farsighted, and how strong the lenses were.
I also noticed how nice many people looked wearing glasses.. especially when they were myopic.
At school when looking around , I had never realized also many students wore glasses, and noticed that most of them  were myopic.
I had always thought my eyesight was perfect, but after trying Megan s glasses , I am not so sure.
I decided that I was going to sit ion the back of the class room and find out.
We had a math class, and I noticed right away that I had trouble reading what the teacher wrote on
the blackboard.
Now i was sure I had a vision problem.and might need glasses.

After talking to my parents, I made an appointment for an eye exam
I now was looking forward to getting glasses, and was happy when the doctor told me I was myopic.
Selecting a frame was fun, and I found one I really liked.
When the glasses were ready and I put them on  , could not believe how  nice and clear ewverything looked , it was fantastic, how well I could see,
I loved the feel of the glasses, and was happy to have them.

The next time Megan came to our house , was all smiles when she saw me wearing glasses.
You look fantastic,I love your glasses.
She wanted to try my glasses , so I suggested we go to my bedroom, and have a nic chat.
When we were in my bedroom , I handed her my glasses , and when she put them on said thewy are a little weaker than mine, but not much
I had  put Megan s glasses on and could see surprisingly well wearing them.
We looked at each other, and I could not help it , but gave Megan a big hug and a kiss, and told her I loved her, she smiled.

Dave and Megan broke up,I missed talking with Megan, I liked that girl very much.
