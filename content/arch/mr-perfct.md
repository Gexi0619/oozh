Mr.  Perfect

Jim and Peggy were college sweethearts, 
Now they are the proud parents of Ashley and Jeff
Jim has always been Mr Perfect,
Always  an oustanding student , football player, everything always  had to be the best.
As vice president of a company and a good income ,they are  enjoying  a good life.
Every year they spend a two week vacation at an exclusive resort .
This is where our story begins.

I am Jeff , 15 years old , my sister Ashley is one year younger.
After a long drive when we were told to admire all the  beautiful scenery, if we could see it or not,
we arrived at our destination.
We were here last year , and had made friends with Katie and Logan .
We understand  they will be  here this year again, and we are looking forward to seeing them again.
Sitting in the dining room that night,  while having our meal ,I have a hard time spotting  Logan.
He looks different ,no wonder,  he is  wearing glasses now. 
Well when we get together to nite , I am sure he will tell us  all about everything that has happened.
Now I know where to look and had to squint  to spot Katie , she looks beautiful as always ,and  it looks like  she has  a new hairdo  .
After the meal was finished we went to the recreation room where we always meet.
I asked Ashley if she had noticed Logan wearing glasses.
Yes I saw him , I had to look really hard  to find him , and then  to realize who the handsome  glasses wearing guy is.

 Logan and Katie  were smiling when they entered the room.
After some hugs and handshakes we all  sat down.
Ashley complimented Logan on how nice he looked wearing glasses.
Logan thanked her , and  then told us his story.
When he went to get his drivers license , he had failed the vision test.
After his eye exam ,was told he was myopic and needed to wear glasses.
 I asked him what is it  like to wear glasses? 
 Well at first  ,I  hated the thought of having to wear glasses.
After I got my glasses ,  and noticed how  much they   improved my  vision , and  then with  all  the compliments I received, realized  that wearing glasses was not so bad.
Now I like wearing my glasses.
I  asked Logan if I could try his glasses,.
I noticed  that  lately my vision is not as good as it has been, and  I like to have some idea , what it is like having to  wear glasses.
Logan handed me his glasses, and I put them on.
Looking through the lenses was almost like somebody turned  on  the bright lites.
Everything thing I looked at was so nice and  clear and well defined ,I could not believe it.
Both Ashley and Katie told me I look fantastic wearing glasses.
With compliments like that and being able to see so much better, 
 I would not  mind having to wear glasses.
I told Ashley how much better  I could see , when wearing Logan s  glasses .
Now I am sure  I need to wear glasses.
Asley said ,dad won t  like it , you are supposed to be perfect,.
If you need glasses ,he most likely will make you  wear contact lenses.
I hated to take the glasses off to give them back to Logan.
The glasses were so comfortable , and I  could see so well  .
I also noticed wearing the glasses gave me such a nice sexy feeling , I loved it.
The rest of the night we talked about a lot of  different kinds of things and had a great time.
I arranged with  Logan to  meet him  the next morning  at the tennis court, for a good game.
Ashley was going  to meet Katie at her room.

The next morning at the tennis court we  both were ready for a good game .
Logan was wearing  sunglasses , and playing very well.
I soon realized that I   did not play as well as last  year.
When we took a break Logan said  you sure are  not as good as you used to be,  what is your problem ?
I have  trouble seeing the ball coming.
Logan said last night you told me how  wearing my  glasses  improved your vision. 
Since I am sure  you have a vision problem,  I brought my spare glasses, would you like to wear them?
Yes I sure would like to  wear  the glasses.
Logan went to his bag and gave me his glasses.
As soon as I put them , again noticed the  big  improvement in my vision.
 Wearing Logans glasses ,I played much better the rest of the game , now I could see the ball coming.
When we finished , Logan said you better go for an eye exam .
I know you are right, but I don t know  how to tell my parents , you know my dad.
I have two pairs of glasses and  a pair of prescription sunglasses, I will give you the pair you are  wearing as a gift so you can see when we play again.
I like that ,  I  sure  can see much better  when wearing your  glasses .
Lucky me ,now I have my own glasses, but when can I  wear them without my parents seeing me
Dad won t like it , I have to be perfect..

I am Ashley , and anxious to visit with  Katie.
I knocked on Katie s door.
Come in .
I walked in and right into Katie s outstreched arms.
We hugged and kissed , we were so glad to be together again.
We sat down and while we chatted I looked around the room.
I noticed  a pair of prescription glasses lying on the top of the dresser.
Katie are those your glasses ?
Yes they are.
You wear glasses now ?
She then told me that when Logan had his eye exam , she had one to.
She is also  myopic and has to wear glasses.
Why did you not tell me ? 
How come you did not wear your glasses last night ?
She told me she  does not like the look of herself wearing glasses.
So I asked her to put the glasses on, and let me be the judge.
When she put the glasses on , I looked at her and told her  she looks very nice wearing glasses.
Katie said I have another pair of glasses ,I like better, I will show you.
Katie put the glasses on , do you like them?
Those glasses look fantastic ,you look so much nicer wearing these than the other pair.
You should wear those glasses all the time, you look so nice ,I love your new look.
Katie , tell me what is it like to wear glasses ?
Here are my  other  glasses , put them on and find out.
I loved the feel of the glasses in my hands, they feel  so nice and  delicate.
I slowly put the glasses  on , and looked around .
Everything I looked at was very  clear and well defined.
Katie , I can  not believe how much better I can  see when  wearing your  glasses.
The glasses are  so   comfortable to wear, and give you  a nice kind of sexy feeling.
 I looked in a mirror and  loved my new look.
How do I look ?
Katie came over still wearing her glasses , looked at me and said  you look fantastic .
You should wear those  glasses all the time, they suit you.
I think I  might have  to, I cannot believe how well I can see . 
Then she hugged me and gave me a kiss on the lips which felt so good I kissed her back.
We sat down on the edge of the bed , both wearing our glasses.
I love wearing your glasses and be able to see so well.
 Katie said you  can wear my  glasses all the time ,I am giving them to you , 
I really love it ,  that you look so nice  wearing glasses.
Those glasses certainly look better on you than me.
Thank you Katie, I love the glasses.
 Is it my imagination   that  wearing  glasses gives  you  a  nice sexy feeling.?
Yes , they do, I often feel the same way .
 She gave me a hug and  slowly put her hand on my thigh.
I am wearing shorts and all of a sudden I feel Katie s hand go up my leg ,
It  felt so good that I put my hand where she wanted it .
We satisfied each other and then decided we should go for a swim to cool off.
She told me , don t forget  the glasses are yours  , you can wear them anytime  you want.,
I will tell dad I lost a pair and he will get me a new pair.
I made Katie  promise me , that  she would be wearing  her glasses more often. 
A  dip in the pool is what we needed.

That night when we got together , Katie was wearing her glasses.
She looked at me and I put my glasses on.
The boys looked at me and asked what was going on.
I told them that since I could see so much better wearing Katie s glasses ,
she gave them to me, so I can see properly.
Logan started to laugh, your brother could not hit a tennis ball until he put my glasses on .
When he did  put my glasses on, he played  so much better.
Since I have a couple of pair I gave Jeff the glasses
I asked Jeff, is Logan telling stories?
Jeff told me it was true, and put Logan s glasses on.
I am  sure I  need to wear glasses 
So do I , I can see perfect wearing Katie s glasses.
Now  all of us are  wearing glasses.
I asked Jeff how are we going to convince Dad we need to wear glasses  .?
I don t think he wants us to wear glasses ,we won t be perfect.

The next night at dinner , Dad mentioned that it was a pity to see Logan and Katie wear glasses.
They were such perfect looking young people, now their good looks are all spoiled.
Well , I think both  Logan  and Katie look very nice wearing glasses, and their parents don t seem to mind.
Young people should not have to wear glasses, old people wear glasses.
I looked at Jeff , he smiled.


When we were back home both Jeff and I wore our glasses when we had a chance.
We wore our glasses at school,  both of us  realizing   that we could not do well in school without wearing  the glasses..

In to day s mail my father got a notice that it was time to renew his drivers license.
He told Jeff to come with him to get his beginners license.
When they got to the office, and after filling out the necessary forms , were told they needed to take the vision test.
Jeff went first and of course failed the test , which  did not surprise him . 
He was told to come back when he got his glasses.
Dad told the lady there was a mistake , his boy did not need glasses,
All the lady said , sir  you are next.
Dad sat down and looked into the machine .
What am I suppose to see?
Just read the lines.
They are all fuzzy , you will have to make them clear.
Sorry sir , if you are not able to read the lines clearly ,you need to wear glasses.
When you wear your  glasses  come back and we will renew your license.
Dad is  furious, he is sure  both of us  have perfect vision..
At dinner that night for once my mother spoke up and told dad he did not have any choice .
Both you  and Jeff need to have an eye exam, I will make the appointment.
 Ashley said make one for me  please, I noticed I have trouble seeing the blackboard at school.
 Mother said , perhaps all of us better go for an eye exam..

The day of the eye exam Logan went first.
The optometrist asked him how he had got along without wearing glasses, his prescription read ,
-1.75 for the right and – 2.00 for the left eye .
I was  next ,and my prescription read – 1.75 for the right and – 1.50 for the left eye.
Dad was very upset that  both his children had to wear glasses.
We selected some nice frames , and had the optician fit us,while dad had his eye exam.
When Dad came out of the examination room he did not look very happy .
He was prescribed bi focals and told to wear them all the time.
He was furious.
My mothers exam went smoothly she was  hyperopic and should wear glasses.

.
A few  days later we  all were wearing our new glasses.
Jeff and I loved our new glasses and the improvement in our vision.
Dad looked very intellectual,  and told us he had  received many compliments on his new look.
Mom looked very nice, and liked wearing her glasses.
A few days later at suppertime  dad  surprised all of us when he said .
I realy like the perfect ,sophisticated look, of my whole family wearing glasses. 
You all look perfect now ,
Just Perfect
