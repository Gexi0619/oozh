description: Young Jodi, torn between farm life and city dreams, discovers the power of glasses and her true passion.

I, made the right decision.


I, Jodi, am the oldest girl in our family, I have 2 younger sisters, Abby, and Jenny, and an older brother Jim.
I will be graduating from high school this summer, and I know, I have to make a big decision.
Here is my story, we live on a farm, I am about 5 feet 6 inches in height, well build, and a beautiful head of hair,
Having grown up on the farm, I would, like my mother says, make any farm boy a perfect wife, but I am not ready for that. 
I certainly, have not met a boy worth considering.
I am very versatile, I can bake, bread, cake, pies, preserve and can vegetables, knit, sow, and milk a cow.


My friend Judy, who shares my seat on the school bus, wants to go to university, which my parents can not afford.
To day, on the way to school, Judy told me, she had an eye exam, and now has to wear glasses, her glasses will be ready next weekend, so she will be wearing her new glasses, on Monday.
I asked her about it, and she told me that she has trouble, seeing objects in the distance clearly, when I mentioned that to my mother, she made sure, I have an eye exam.
I realize, I might have the same vision trouble, seeing some of the far away farms nice and clear, like I used to be able to do, not fuzzy, as I see them now, perhaps, I should be wearing glasses to.


On Monday, Judy was wearing her new glasses, she looked very nice, wearing the glasses, and told me, she is glad to have the glasses, she likes her new look, and her vision is so good now, she loves it.
She let me try her glasses, and when wearing them, sure noticed a big improvement, in my vision.
That night, I mentioned, to my mother about Judy's glasses, who assured me, that my vision is perfect., that glasses are for rich people, to look important.
I think, I know better, but there is no point,. to argue with her.


I have now graduated, and my mother thinks, it is time for me, to get serious, about a boy, so that I can get married, and have a family. 
I have other ideas, I would like to go to the city, and get a good job, so I can make some money.
My dad said, go ahead, you will find out, what life, in the city, is all about, and then, you can come home, we will still have a bed for you.


I am now in the city, and have a room at the Y, until I get some money, and find, a good boarding house, or room, that I can afford.
Walking around town, I came past a bakery, and could not resist going in it smelled so good.
I looked around, and everything, that I looked at, was very good quality, I told the man behind the counter, how impressed I was.
We started a conversation, and he asked me, if I would like to work for him, his wife has artherites, and is ready to retire, so I can take her place.
He told me, what he would pay me, and what he expected from me, and then showed me around, the bakery
I accepted, and would start the next day.
Now, I am all excited, I have a job, and I think fair pay, and I always liked baking.


Working at the bakery, was great, I really enjoyed my work, and my boss told me, he was very pleased with my work.
I was able to walk the short distance from work, to my room, that saved me some money.


A couple of weeks later, when window shopping, I came past a second hand store, being curious, I walked in and looked around. 
I spotted a box, with some eyeglasses in it.
While browsing through the box, a pretty, glasses wearing girl, about my age came over, and asked me, if I was looking for something in particular, 
while I was holding, one of the glasses in my hand, to have a closer look.
The glasses, that you are looking at, are the first pair of glasses, that I wore.
As you can see, if have had, a number of glasses, I am myopic, and cannot see distant objects clearly, without my glasses. 
I have the same problem, but I do not have glasses. Try these glasses, and she handed me a nice brown pair. 
When I put the glasses on, and looked around, noticed a big improvement in my vision, I looked in an old dresser mirror, to see how I looked wearing glasses.
The girl said, I think you look very nice wearing glasses, I agreed with her, I liked my glasses wearing look, 
She told me the price, I can afford that, and gave her the money, still wearing the glasses.
I have an other pair of glasses, with a little stronger prescription, if you are not sure, about the glasses you bought, and if you like to try the stronger ones, I will hold them for you.
Now, I have a pair of glasses, and proudly walked down the street, I really liked my improved vision, everything looked so nice and clear. The next day at work, both my boss, and his wife told me, how nice I look, wearing glasses.


I soon have to start, and find an affordable place to live, I can't stay at the Y , much longer, I like this part of town, and it is close to my work.
I noticed a sign, boarding for young ladies only, and went and rang the doorbell
A middle aged lady, opened the door, and invited me in., and asked me to sit down, in a large dining room.
After asking me a number of questions, to make sure I was, going to be a good guest. 
Then she called her son, he looked me over, and said, no mother, she won't do, she wears glasses,.
When I heard that, I excused myself and left, that was not, the place, where I wanted to live.


I like wearing my glasses, I can see so much better now, and like the way glasses look on me.
Having nothing else to do, I walked to the store, where I had bought the glasses, and just for fun, wanted to try the glasses, that had the stronger prescription. Kim, who runs the store, for her dad, smiled. 
Hello, Jodi, let me guess, you would like to try the stronger glasses,
You are right, well, here they are, 
As soon as I put the glasses on, I noticed a big difference,
I walked out the door, so I could compare the glasses, looking down the street.
I liked my vision much better, with the stronger glasses, and went in and told Kim, that I liked the stronger glasses best
Well that is good, I am glad to hear it, Jodi, I think, this frame, looks even better on you.
By the way, have you found a place to live yet?
No, I have not.
Well, I have an extra room, in my apartment upstairs, if you are interested, we can split the cost, come over to night, and I will show you the room, and we can figure out, what your share of the cost will be.
That sounds great, I will be over to see you.


Kim was all excited showing, me her apartment, and the room, that she had available.
The room was big, with a big bed, and some other furniture,.
We settled on a price, and I would be moving in, the next day, after work.
I was very happy, I loved, my new stronger glasses, and had a nice room, at a very reasonable price.
I had to make sure, I write my mother, my new address, and other news, but will not mention my glasses.


The first night, after I had moved, I caught Kim pleasuring herself,, sitting on the sofa.
She laughed and afterwards, showed me her collection, of sex toys, I am sure educated now, about the use of sex toys.


-------------------


To day at work, I was informed, by my boss, that his son is coming home, to take over the business, he has finished, the culinary course he was taking.
Now, I wonder, is his son going to like me, and my work, well I will find out soon
Every thing always seems has to happen at once.


Jodi, meet my son Trevor.
Wow, Trevor sure was a good looking guy. tall, nice hair, and wears fashionable glasses, he is beautiful. 
He smiled, shook hands with me, and said Jodi, I am sure, looking forward to working with you.
I am sure, I like working with him, he is my type of a real man. and feeling all excited, and slowly went back to work.
About an hour later, my sister Abby, came into the store.
We gave each other a hug, then she really looked at me, Jodi, you look fantastic wearing glasses, when did you get them.
Abby, what are you doing here?
Mom, thought since you are doing so well, in the city, and thinks, I am to wild, and won't look at boys, that you will help me get a job, and that you have a big bed, so I can sleep with you.
Well, I guess, I am stuck with her, so I told her where I live, and to make sure to see Kim first, and tell her, who you are.


Abby went to see Kim, who fell in love with her, the minute she saw her. 
She showed Abby, how to get, to the apartment, and Abby, being the nosy type, went through Jodi's bedroom drawers, and found, Jodi's first pair of glasses. 
She put the glasses on, and realizes, that the glasses, really improve her vision. 
Looking at herself in a mirror, really likes her glasses look.
After she finished unpacking her suitcase, sat down and watched T.V. still, wearing Jodi's glasses, she loved wearing the glasses, her vision was so much better, loved how the glasses looked on her, and that the glasses are so comfortable to wear.
Both, Jodi and Kim, congratulated Abby, on her new look, after she told them, why, she was wearing the glasses, she is going to wear the glasses, all the time, because she loves wearing them, and she can see so much better, when wearing the glasses.
Jodi did not object, she had found out, that she needed glasses, when trying Judy's glasses, when she started to wear glasses, and Abby is most likely myopic like she is.

The next day, Abby went job hunting, she was not really in a hurry, to get a job, she liked the apartment, and living the lazy life.
She went to the mall, to look around, she sure liked the big city.
Every time Abby, looked in a mirror, when window shopping, was so happy, to see herself ,with her glasses wearing look, she had never realized, that wearing glasses was so much fun.
She spotted an optical store, she had never seen, a big optical store like that, and when she walked in, could not believe how many glasses, were on display..
The optician came over, and asked Abby, if she would like to try some of the frames.?
Yes, I would love to.
Abby, loved trying all the frames, and told the optician, she would like to have all of them, but could not afford any new glasses right now, first she had to find a job, and make some money.
The next day, Abby went back to the optical store, she loved it there.
Well, I see you are back, did you decide on a frame.
No, I just love looking, trying and handling all these glasses,
The optician smiled, perhaps we can help you, please sit down, I will be right back.
When the optician came back, asked Abby to follow her, they came to an office, where she asked her to go in and sit down.
A pleasant looking, glasses wearing man came in, introduced himself, being the optometrist, and owner of the optical store.
After a little chat with Abby, she had told him, all he wanted to know, she loves glasses, and likes wearing them. and he was looking for this kind of girl, to assist the optician. Abby, would you like to work here, 
Yes, sir, I sure would like that. 
He told her, what her pay, working hours, etc. would be, and that she could start the next day., Abby said, I will be here.
.
Abby was all smiles, and so excited , when Kim and I settled down for the evening.
I sure am glad, that she is happy, I have never thought, the wild, fashionable Abby, to fall in love with glasses., and find herself a job.


The next day, Abby arrived for work, the optometrist, wanted to show her, all the procedures, that took place during an eye exam, and at the same time, she had the first eye exam, and she was full of questions.
When finished, he asked Abby, when she had her last eye exam?
I never had an eye exam, those glasses are my sisters old glasses, I found them, put them on, and I liked the glasses, my new look, and the way glasses, improved my vision.
Well, according to the exam, I just gave you, they are not the right prescription, here is your prescription, and showed Abby, how to read a prescription, and what the figures meant.
The glasses you are wearing, are -1.00, and you need -1.25 for your right and -1.50 for you left eye, and you have some astigmatism, you will notice a big difference, when you get your new glasses.
Go, and see the optician, she will help you.
Sir, I cannot afford new glasses, don't worry Abby, the are part of your job.


Abby, was all smiles, when she came home, proudly wearing her new glasses, and telling the girls all about them.
Jodi, had other things on her mind, Trevor had asked her for a date, to go and see a movie, Saturday night, she would have to get some new clothes, and ask Abby to do her hair and make up, Abby was so good at that, and she wanted to look her best.


Jodi was all dressed, and looked so nice, when Trevor came, to take her out.
He complimented her, how beautiful she looked,
They enjoyed the movie, first held hands, and then did some kissing, and realized they sure liked each other.
When Jodi came home, after a wonderful date, realized , that she had made the right decision, going to the big city.
