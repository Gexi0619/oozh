description: Discover Nicole's journey from trying on a pair of glasses to pursuing a career as an optician.
---
My Lucky Day 

My name is Nicole , believe it or not, I love wearing glasses. 
After the summerbreak ,I will be starting my last year of high school.,  
Then my plan is  go to the Community College and take the  2 year course  to become a licensed  optician and contact lens fitter..

Let s start at the begining .
My mother is a single parent, my father died when I was about four years old.
Having a fulltime working mother , I spend the time after school with our neighbour till my mother comes home.
Our neighbor s  daughter Trixie, is in my class at school.
We  get along well and are good friends.
Trixie s older sister Amy wears glasses, and last week she got a  new pair of glasses.
A few days later Trixie showed me Amy s old glasses. 
Trixie told me , I  tried to wear the glasses ,but when I wear them everything looks so fuzzy .
Would you like to try  wearing  the glasses ?
Yes , I would like that  very much , I have never tried to glasses .
When I put the glasses on and looked around  was really surprised , I  could see  much better.
I looked out of the window, and noticed  I could read  the  numbers on the houses across the street.
When I  took the glasses off, I  could not even see the numbers.
Trixie I love  these glasses ,it s unbelievable ,I can see everything .

Now after school ,when I am at Trixie s place, I wear the glasses.
I just love the glasses, I can see  so much better, and like the feel of them on my face.
I always wished they were mine.
One day when I was wearing the  glasses  , I forgot to take them  off before going home.
When my mother saw me wearing the glasses wanted to know all about them.
So I told her that Amy now has new glasses  and these are her old ones .
I have been wearing the glasses  when I am at Trixie s place.
I can see so much better when wearing Amy s  glasses .
We better  make an appointment for you to get your eyes examined and if you need to wear glasses, we will get you new glasses..

I was all excited when on Saturday we walked into Jones Optical store.
I was going to get my own glasses.
Looking around and seeing all those nice glasses  on display is very excitng.
Doctor Jones is very nice, he explained everything he did during the exam
When  finished, he said  Nicole you need to wear glasses, you are nearsighted.
With mom s help we selected a nice frame . 
After taking some measurements the optician  told us ,the glasses would be ready in a couple of hours.
Mom and I went to the Mall for a snack.

After Mrs.Brown the optician had adjusted  my glasses ,  I looked around ,noticed that now I could see  even better  , than when I wore Amy s glasses,
Mom said Nicole you look beautiful wearing  glasses and  I am  happy that you can now see so well.. 

When Trixie and I walked to school on Monday I wore my new glasses proudly.
Most of the kids told me I looked nice.
I  told the few who made nasty remarks ,that they were just jealous, because I can now  see better  than they can.
When I came home that night , and looked  in my glasses case, noticed a piece of paper
I tried to read it, it looked like O.D -1.25 .O S -1.00 , I did not know the meaning of  the numbers and letters , but it looked important so I  put  the piece of paper back in my glasses case.

I went to see Dr Jones  every year , and every year my prescription increased a little.
A few years later  I asked Dr. Jones , if he could explain to me what the  numbers on the piece of paper meant.
He showed me how to read a  prescription ,so I could understand it.
I put every year s  new presciption in the glasses case  with all  the other ones. 
My present prescrition now reads – 6.75 for the right and – 6.25 for the left eye and a little astigmatism.
At my last  eye exam , I mentioned to Dr. Jones that since I like glasses so much , I plan to become an optician.
Dr Jones offered me the opportunity to work Friday nights and Saturday s to help Mrs. Brown the optician in the store, and to get familiar with some of the procedures..
Off course I accepted .
I  don t have much of a social life, the only real  friend I have is Trixie, and all she can think of is boys.
I have had a few dates , some of the guys were all right.
The one I can remember best , loved the looks of my glasses.
He told me the glasses  turned him on, and  also told met that was all he liked about me.

You have no idea how much I enjoy my weekend job at the optical store.
A lot of students from school  come in to get new glasses . 
Some of the students even ask me to help them select a new frame .
Suggesting the right type of frame is always a lot of fun .
I love talking to a younger person , who is all excited  about getting new glasses, or 
 the ones who are really upset because they don t want  to wear glasses.
I love it when people are happy with their new glasses selection.
The summer  is going fast and next week , I will be back for my last year of high school.

New people moved into the house next door.  
Kevin , a well build good looking guy about my age and a  pretty younger girl  , Mandy.
When school started , Kevin  , now my classmate, received  a lot of attention from all the girls.
He is a  handsome, studious type, but  he seems to ignore all the attention.
About a month later , walking to school, Kevin mentioned to me that  he lately is getting more  headaches when studying. 
I asked him if he ever had an eye exam, it is possible  you might need  glasses.
I never thouhgt of that, you might be right. 
He had his eye exam, and was prescribed glasses , he is hyperopic and has some astigmatism
He thanked me for my good suggestion , he likes his  glasses , no headaches, and he looks fantastic.


Graduation time came .
A few days before the prom, Kevin told me he wanted to talk to me.
I like you Nicole, but I like boys better ,I am gay.
My parents know, and they have accepted it.
I know I have to go to the prom, now that  you know, would you like to be my date ?
Kevin , I will be  delighted to be your date. 
He thanked me and told me ,  I am a real friend. 
Me ,with the best looking guy in our  class were the talk of the prom.
We had a very enjoyable time.

After a another  great summer working at Jones Optical, I started the course to become an optician.
The studies of  physiology of the eye , and  optics are very interesting but also require a lot of studying.
Part of the course is practical, which I like very much.
I  spend a lot of time in the library, to search for more information and  to study.
The Library and cafeteria  are a great place to meet other  students.

In my final year , when I was sitting by myself enjoying a coffee in the cafeteria,   a  pretty  women about my age , asked me if I would like some company.
I asked her to sit down and told her my name, and the course I am taking.
Hi, I am Kirsten, I am taking  the business course.
Kirsten was very easy to talk to , and I  really enjoyed her company, so we arranged to meet again, and  soon became friends.

Kirsten and I  went to see a movie, and after the show  went to the foodcourt .
Somebody said my name and when I looked up, there was Kevin with a friend.
Do you mind when we sit down with you ?
Please do .
Kevin you are wearing new glasses, you  look fantastic.
Thank you ,Nicole.
I would like you to meet my friend, Andrew.
I introduced Kirsten ,and  we had an enjoyable get together.
After Kevin and his friend had left , Kirsten said they are real gentlemen.
Yes they are, they are gay.

The next time I had coffee with Kirsten , she asked me what it was like wearing  glasses.
Well glasses make you see properly ,are comfortable, and now are fashionable  .
What made you ask ?
Well I  have a lot of headaches lately , and wonder if I need to wear glasses.
I suggest you make an appointment with Dr. Jones.
If  you need to wear glasses I will find you a frame that will make you look so good ,
that you will love wearing glasses.

Kirsten had an eye exam the following Saturday .
She is hyperopic and has some astigmatism .
It was a lot of fun to pick out a new frame that really looked good on Kirsten .
At last we found one and after the optician did the necessary measurements , Kirstens glasses would be ready in the late afternoon. 

 After the optician had fitted the glasses , and Kirsten looked at herself in mirror , was all smiles.
Nicole , I love my new  look ,  the way the lenses magnify my eyes , I feel beautiful.
I love the  feel of the glasses on my face, a nice sexy feeling.
She took a hold of me and gave me a big  hug , thank you Nicole. 
Kirsten then suggested  I come over to her apartment , and  have a pizza with her.
When I came to her apartment after work , she was waiting  with a nice pizza and a big bottle of wine.
Sitting on the sofa watching a movie , eating and drinking wine ,  noticed Kirsten started to cuddle up to me.
She kept on telling me how much she likes her glasses, and how she loves wearing them.
A couple of times she gave me a thank you kiss , while her hands touched my breasts.
I was pretty drunk by that time , and  kind of enjoyed  all the attention.
Soon after I dozed off and fell asleep..
I was dreaming , a wonderful dream, and I felt  Oh- SOoooo !!! good , it was wonderful.
When I woke up the next morning, with a big hangover ,  noticed  I was in bed with Kirsten.
I did not know what to think or say.
I said goodbye , thanked her for an enjoyable night  ,and went  home .
Time to start studying for my final exams.

                                             XXXXXXXXXXXX

All my hard work paid off.
I graduated with honors ,and now I am a licensed optician and contact lens fitter.
Dr. Jones offered me a full time job ,I could not be happier.
One of the perks of the job is a free eye exam and a pair  glasses of your choice.
Dr. Jones told me, he  would  like  to do the exam now ,even if I was  not due  for an eye exam yet.
The unsual part was that both Dr. jones and Mrs. Brown the optician helped me select not one but two nice  new frames.
I asked Dr. Jones what was  going on ?​
He told me that both he and  Mrs. Brown are  retiring .
My brother s son , Brandon just graduated , he  is  now an optometrist , and will be taking over the business , and you are included.
When will the new Dr. Jones arrive ?
He will be here to morrow, let s get your new glasses made up so you will look your very best.
Our lab technician had my new glasses ready in good time and when I put them on could not decide which pair I liked best.
I loved the look of the new lenses and the fantastic frames.

The next day I was all  nerves.
I  had been very fussy with my make up and my overal appearance when I went to work.
About an hour later a tall, handsome, glasses wearing man walked into the store.
When I approached him ,he smiled and said Hi...  is  Dr.Jones in.
Please tel him ,Jimmie boy is here to see him.
Hearing the voice, Dr. Jones came out of his office smiling, 
Hello Jim, I would like you to meet our optician Nicole .

Dr, Jim Jones is very easy to work with, I like him very much.
We soon worked like a team .
Business was good and everything went well. 
About a year  later , Jim was notified that we would have to vacate the premises  .
The owners of the store had sold the property to a real estate developer. 
Jim was very upset ,  since he is not that familiar with the area  yet, wonders what to do now. 
I told him , that Kevin my neighbor  ,is The Mall manager.
The Mall has  just finished adding more  retail space, and are  looking for new tennants.
Dr, Jim  asked me to arrange a meeting  with Kevin.

After closing , Jim and I went to meet Kevin at the mall. 
I noticed  that Jim and Kevin seem to like each other at first sight ,  that made the meeting more enjoyable.
Kevin showed us what he thought would be a prime location .
Both Jim and I agreed, the store facing the foodcourt would give us a lot of exposure.
There is  enough room  for a lab,  examination rooms and a good size reception and display area.
I could picture a beautiful optical store.

A few days later a very pleasant young man walked into the store.
He wore glasses with a high myopic prescription.
My guess is – 15.00 to – 20.00.
With a big smile on his face said , lady you are beautiful, 
I  sure like to talk to you later, where is Jimmie boy? 
Jim came out of  his  office , that sounds like Logan, what are you doing here?
I finished my course for pediatric optometry,  now I need a job
My girlfriend broke up with me, she does not like me doing G O C .
I am at loose ends right now.
Nicole meet Logan, the best optometrist in our graduating class.
Now I understood the strong myopic prescription . 
He looked  really good wearing the high prescription glasses. 
Jim  made arrangements to meet with Logan for dinner .
Logan said great ,but not without Nicole , I like her to join us.
After an enjoyable meal and good conversation we went to the mall .
We  showed Logan  the location of the new store.
Logan was very impressed .
He asked Jim if he might be interested in a partnership , he has some money to help out.
Jim asked me ,Nicole what do you think?
Well the town is growing fast,  the  the mall is open seven days with longer hours .
I think we need another optometrist and an optician.
Logan said  , now I know why I like her , she is smart , as well as beautiful.


During the next few days Jim and Logan settled all the arrangements for their partnership.
When Saturday came Logan asked Jim if he had any objection  him dating me? 
No, go and have a good time, I have a  date already .
Logan asked me , you want me to wear my regular + 2.00 glasses or  do G.O C.
I told him , surprise me .

My mother teased me about fussing around so much for a date, he is only a  guy.
No mom, wait till you see him , there is something special about Logan.

The doorbell rang, and when  my mother opened the door , I heard,
Good evening Mrs Sanders , I am Logan .
I brought you some flowers. 
Wow !!  I can see where Nicole got her beautiful looks from.
Come in Logan , I think Nicole is ready, and thank you for the flowers.
Now let me have a real good look at you.
Yes ,you pass the test, you can take Nicole out.
Have a good time , and don t forget to bring her home.

When I got settled in the car, Logan said I thought I better wear my regular glasses ,
 I did not want to surprise your mother.
I don t think after the way you introduced yourself  anything would surprise her.
We had a great time , and when he saw me to the door, I  found out he is also  a great kisser .

The grand opening of Jones optical store at The Mall was a  succes.
A second optician was hired , and some part time help .
The biggest surprise was , when I found out  that Jim s regular date is Kevin .
Now I realized why Jim was so easy to work with.
Logan and I are  getting along  very well, I love the guy, and I amsure he feels the same about me.
 Not long after he asked me to move in with him.
When I discussed this with my mother , she mentioned that her sister , who is very lonely after her husbands death,  had asked her to move in with her.
Why don t you two get married and move into this house . 
Logan agreed , and wedding plans were made.
Kevin , is going to give me away, and his sister Mandy  will be my bridesmaid.
Jim is going to be Logan s best man.

On a nice sunny day we were married ,  and everything went as  planned.

                                              XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

We are now married for about 10 years.
Having had a lot fun doing  G O C , and other silly things with glasses,  that we both  liked to do. 
We even managed to  have  a family..
Ashley is  9 , Bradley [ Brad ] is 8 and Katie just started grade one. 
Logan and I always liked wearing glasses and we are not  surprised our children  now do to.
Glasses are a part of their life.
Logan and I wear glasses, my mother wears them, and they all are frequent visitors at Jones Optical.
Brad is hyperopic like his dad, and has been wearing glasses since he was 6 years old..
Katie loves to wear her non prescription glasses,  because she does not want to be left out.
Ashley just started to wear prescription glasses for myopia.
I  realize , I got  my  first pair of glasses  when I was about her age.
All of a sudden I remembered my first glasses case with all my prescriptions I had saved.
That night I showed all the old prescriptions to Logan .
He noticed that Ashley s glasses prescription was almost identical as my first one,.
Logan thought it was great to have all that information , now you have some idea what to expect. 
He is convinced that myopia in females is very hereditary, and expects Katie to be myopic 
at about the same age.
The girls will look as beautiful as you are when they are grown up.
We sure are lucky , they all like to wear glasses ,like we do.
Once and a while ,I still think  about the day when Trixie asked me, if I would like to try Amy s old glasses. 
That was the day I  found out I needed to wear glasses.
My lucky day .
