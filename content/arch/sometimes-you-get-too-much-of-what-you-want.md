description: In this gripping tale, a teenager bluffs his way into glasses and accidentally induces myopia, facing the consequences.
---
In 2017 14 year old Larry somehow convinced his new Optometrist he couldn't see the 20/20 line anymore. Larry has figured out which line is 20/20 by talking to his friends Dad who is an Optician. The man explains to Larry most of the time when letters are projected on a wall the bottom line is 20/15 and the next line is 20/20. Larry had on previous eye exams showed very mild Astigmatism that was not bad enough for glasses only in his right eye. The autorefractor showed the Astigmatism but not Myopia. The catch was Larry wanted glasses with a prescription but his now retired former Dr. refused to prescribe any correction.
Larry's new Optometrist does prescribe -.50 glasses for each eye with an Astigmatism of -25 and 22 for his right eye. A happy Larry is told he does not need to wear his glasses full time just when needing to see far away and reading if he gets headaches.
Larry gets the popular black "nerd"' frame glasses and despite what he is told wears them full time almost from day one. The only exception is Larry who could actually read some of the 20/15 line takes his glasses off to read because it is more comfortable.
As the year goes on Larry who is now completely used to wearing glasses notices that he is now able and prefers to read with them on. Larry who started his freshman year of high school in August of 2017 is starting to wonder if he made a mistake bluffing his way into glasses. Larry from reading the internet including this board wonders if he has accidently induced Myopia which he did not intend on doing.
Larry gets his answer in August of 2018 when he goes for his eye exam. Larry now can only read the 20/50 lines with each eye and is prescribed glasses of -1.50 for each eye. On top of this Larry now has Astigmatism in both eyes. 2018 prescription is R -1.50 -50 25 and L 1.50 -.25 90. The catch Larry actually liked having good vision but wanted glasses but not fakes or ones with the lenses punched out. Larry is not happy even though he has wanted glasses since he was very young but he did not want to have to rely on them full time.
Larry goes thru his freshman year and now realizes he is not able to go without glasses while having anywhere close to good vision. Larry did on occasion enjoy going without his glasses. In August of this year Larry goes for his regular eye exam and his prescription has risen toÂ  -2.00 R and -2.25 L with the Astigmatism unchanged.. Larry questions his Optometrist why such a big increase. The Dr. does not think it's from wearing his glasses too much noting that Larry has grown about 6 inches in height and bulked up some and possibly his eyesight hasn't kept up with the growth. Larry who lives with his single Dad who has just started to wear weak readers at age 43 and since nobody in the close family is Myopic neither man understands why Larry's vision has went bad. Larry now wished he hasn't bluffed his way into glasses two years ago as he now hates how bad his vision has became.
This story is fantasy but I wonder if anybody teenager or adult has accidently induced Myopia due to wearing glasses they didn't need?
