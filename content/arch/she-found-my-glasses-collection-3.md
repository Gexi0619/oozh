She found my glasses collection. #3




I have a younger, and an older sister, Sadie and Kristen, and I am 8 year old Micheal.
I love to play sports, and I spend a lot of time on my computer,.


To day, we all are due for our yearly eye exam.
The big surprise was, when I was prescribed to wear glasses.
The opometrist told me, I am hyperopic, and have some astigmatism, and told me to wear my glasses, full time.
I was not very happy, having to wear glasses, how am I going to play sports wearing glasses?


When., I got my glasses, which I understand are +1.25, and I put them on, everything far away, looked a bit fuzzy, the optician told me that if I wear my glasses full time, after a couple of weeks, my vision will be perfect.
When I looked at myself, was not impressed, I looked so different, however, I did not have any other choice, than to wear the glasses.


After a couple of weeks, my vision was perfect, and I now play sports wearing glasses.
I, now, like wearing my glasses, no headaches, reading is so much easier, and I am getting used to looking at my self, wearing glasses.
My report card, at the end of the school year, was the best I ever had..


Now, I find eyeglasses, fascinating, and I think, I am going to see if I can get a hold of more glasses,, and try to make a collection.
I asked a lot of the glasses wearing students, for their old glasses, and now have about a half dozen pairs.
I, of course, tried to wear all the glasses, but wearing some of the glasses, I sure found out, that it is difficult, to see properly, when wearing some of them. 


At my next eye exam, my prescription went up to + 2,25, I don’t mind, I am used to wearing glasses, and think, that I look better when wearing glasses, and now, will have another pair for my collection.


At school, I have been approached by some of the students, about some glasses that they have, and now, I am even buying some,.
To day, one student came to me, my mother and sisters, who all wear glasses, are going to dispose of all their old glasses, are you interested? I bought 9 pair of glasses, for two dollars.


My collection is becoming more interesting , because there are,, quite a few glasses, with a higher prescription, and after getting more knowledge, about glasses and vision, using the computer, I enjoy my collection more all the time.

About five years later.


I am glad, I wear glasses, the corona virus, pandamic, sure changed our lives.,with the on line schooling, and extra reading, I have no headaches.


My sisters are now complaining more than ever, they cannot go out, have to wear a mask, which they feel, takes away all their good looks.
They are using the computer for schooling, and of course their phones, to keep track of any new,s their friends might have.
The result is, they are having more head aches now.
When I mentioned, they most likely need to wear glasses, to look after their problems, they threw a book at me.


After having been confined, for a couple of months, and to keep my sisters busy, my mother, made them clean all the bedrooms.
Next thing I know, they are in my bedroom, and going through all my drawers.
Sadie, noticed my box full of glasses.
Mom, come and see,,what I just found.
Kirsten and my mother came running in,, not knowing what to expect.
Look at all the glasses, I just found in his cupboard.
Micheal, what for havens sake, are you doing with a box full of eyeglasses.
Mom, that is my collection, I try to get all different types of glasses..
I have been collecting glasses, for a few years now, and they were all given to me, or I bought them, with my allowance money.
I like glasses.
Well, I never heard of anybody having a glasses collection, but if it makes you happy, I will not stop you.


When Sadie, was looking, to see if she could see her friends house down the street, complained,, that she could not see Amber’s house anymore, everything in the distance looks fuzzy, why? 
Because you need to wear glasses, I think you are myopic.
What do you know, Mr. Smartie pants,
Well, I can see Amber’s house, nice and clear,.


My mother hearing the conversation, mentioned that we all missed our eye exam appointments, because of the corona virus, and Sadie you might have been prescribed glasses.
O ! mother, my vision is fine.
Sadie, if you would like to see, what glasses can do for you, I think, I can help you.
Micheal, can you help her,? you have enough glasses.
I think so, if Sadie is interested finding out, if glasses will improve her vision, she can come, and see me in my room.
Sadie, I think you should go with Micheal, at least, give it a try.


Sadie, came to my room, and I looked through my collection.
I found four frames, that would fit Sadie, with low myopic prescriptions.
When she tried the frames, she stood in front of the mirror, to see what she looked like, wearing glasses.
Then, I managed, to get her to look out of the window., trying the different glasses.
Micheal, I think you are right, I need to wear glasses, with the glasses, I am wearing right now, I can see everything, far away, nice and clear.
Can I have the glasses? Sure, when you get your own, you can give the glasses back to me.
So Sadie, is now wearing glasses.


Now, Kirsten wanted to try some glasses to.
I asked her to look down the street, and tell me, what she could see, nice and clear.
Now, I had some idea, which glasses might improve her vision.
When, I handed her the glasses, and after she tried them all, surprised me with her choice.
I was sure the glasses had a -1.75 prescription, I had not expected that.
Now, both my sisters, are wearing glasses, so I asked my mother if she needed glasses to.
I think I do for reading, but my far away vision is good.
So, now my mother, has a pair of glasses, to make close work and reading easier for her.
We, will have to talk to dad, when he comes home, from his shift at the fire station, perhaps he needs to wear glasses to.


When, my dad came home, and saw both his girls wearing glasses, wanted to know all about it.
He wanted to see my collection, and when he did, told me, how he had liked collecting baseball cards.
I think, it is nice, that you have a hobby, that you enjoy.


Now, I am waiting for the virus to go, so life becomes more normal, and hope, I can add more glasses to my collection, when my sisters, and mother get a proper eye exam, and they all wear glasses.
