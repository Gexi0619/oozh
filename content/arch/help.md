description: A visually impaired girl goes on a nerve-wracking date with a handsome guy who surprises her with his kindness.
---
I know it has been a while since I last posted here but I’ve been so busy you wouldn’t believe it!

School is hard, and I don’t mean it in a personal way, it’s just hard! 

I want to share something with you that I never thought was going to happen to me. I’m not a bad looking girl, I’m 5.5 feet tall, my hair is long and light brown, I’m not that skinny but definitely I’m not chubby… My eyes are big and brown, and if we talk about “curves” I feel good. 

The big “problem” is that even though I have a lot of male friends, I have no lucky when it comes to dates. 
My friend Chris asked me out last year and after two weeks he told me we were better as friends, and I heard him say to my friend  Nick that he felt awkward introducing to his family a girl who looked like a blind person (With my glasses on I’m not blind, maybe I can’t see like “normal” people would  but you know, my visual acuity is 20/60 in my right eye and 20/40). 

And it made me feel really bad :/ 

3 months ago my cousin Adrianne told me she wanted to set me up with some guy she trains with (She does tae kwon do) who was single and was super handsome but I never heard of him again until he texted me a month ago.

He told me his name (Samuel, which I think is cute… Sam & Sam), he also told me he is 21 years old, he trains 4 days per week 6 hours per day and he studies marketing.
Let me describe what Samuel looks like, he is tall I don’t really know how tall but very tall, he has blue eyes and he has light brown hair, as an athlete he has an amazing body too.

Anyways to make a long story short, he asked me to go on a “date” with him, he told me he liked Starbucks so we could grab some coffee and then go to a park near his house. Of course I said yes and we set up a day and time to meet.

I was soooo nervous about seeing him! And think I tried like 4 outfits before feeling I looked good enough. I wanted to look casual and cute but not like a lazy girl so I chose to wear a sleeveless white shirt, black leggings, converse and a leather jacket, I felt kind of sexy but then I started doing my make-up and I felt soooo conscious about my glasses and I wanted so bad to take them off :/

I arrived at starbucks at 7:00pm and he was already there but I didn’t see him until he got up and yelled –Over here Sam! And I pretended I was looking at my phone but to be honest from where I was I couldn’t see his face. 
I approached and greeted him and then he asked me if he could order for me, I said yes and he went. I could see a group of girls on the table next to ours looking at me and then looking at him probably thinking what the hell was I doing with that gorgeous guy… 
He came back with our drinks and he said he liked the pumpkin late but he added a shot of coconut, and it tasted good.

We started talking and I felt so good. He was kind and fresh and very interesting to talk to. Then I made such a rookie mistake… I took the top of the cup and when I was about to drink my glasses steamed really bad, he laughed and asked me if he could clean them and I have read stories here and I know some of you have a fetish with girls like me and it doesn’t bother me but one of the things guys who enjoy girls with poor eyesight is cleaning their glasses right? Well I told him he could and I handed him my glasses…
I felt very uncomfortable because I couldn’t see at all. It’s hard explaining my vision to normal sighted people but is like seeing only blurry dots of colors, some are big and some are medium but when I take my glasses off I can’t even see a person standing 10cms away from me (I mean I can tell is a person and maybe if I’m familiar with their body shape I’ll know who they are but to see the eyes, nose, lips, and dimples or facial features is just impossible to my bare eyed being)

He had them for so long and I remember panicking inside, then I heard him leaving them on the table but is not a good thing when your glasses almost match the color of the table and you can’t see them! I reached my hand to pick them and he stopped me, he asked me to leave them off for a while and I wanted him to like me so bad that I did. We talked and talked and he told me I was squinting and I told him I was making an effort to see him but I still couldn’t, he then asked me all types of questions about my eyes and when he was done he said it was time to go to the park so I reached for my eyes and once again one more time and he then took them, he then told me that if it wasn’t weird for me he’d like to take my hand and lead me without my glasses.

That was a bit awkward I must say but he said it in such a sweet way that I absolutely said yes, go ahead so he took my hand and we walked towards the exit door… Man! I felt weird, I seriously couldn’t see. Not even people, they were like blobs of color…

Anyways in the park we had the most amazing conversation and he told me he liked me a lot and that he is interested in me being more than his friend so I told him I liked him too but I had to be honest and make sure he knew what’s going on with me before moving to the next step. I can’t see without my glasses, I said and then he told me he knew that, he already knew I couldn’t see that good with them either but he had realize how self-conscious I am about them so he thought I’d be more comfortable this way… To be honest I kind of like it but there’s like a time limit for me not wearing glasses because headaches arrive. 

He kissed me and took my head on his hands, I placed my hands on his chest and I could almost feel his heartbeats. We then got up and he took me home. Before leaving he kissed me one more time and put my glasses on my face. 

I would like to hear an advice from you guys… Should I stop this? Should I date him one more time? I really really like him but I don’t know if the glasses thing is a bit weird. What do you say? What would you do?  Thank you guys is awesome to have found people who appreciate what I have to say instead of just telling me to grow the fuck up lol.

Greetings!

Sam.
