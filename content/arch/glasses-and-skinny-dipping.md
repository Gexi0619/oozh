I am the youngest in our family, my name is Logan.
Believe it or not, I know quite a bit about vision, because every one in our family except me wears glasses.
My parents, and my two older sisters, all wear glasses for myopia.
I have heard them talk about their prescriptions, and the increases they had after their eye exams.
When I see how exited my sisters get when they get new glasses, I often wonder what is it like to wear glasses.
I never heard anyone really complain about having to wear glasses.
Using the computer and reading up about vision and glasses, gave me a better understanding what glasses are all about, and now have a some idea when they are talking about glasses and prescriptions.

Growing up surrounded by people who wear glasses, I usually notice almost every person who wears glasses.
There are a couple of guys in my year who wear glasses, and some of the girls.
I think they all look pretty good wearing glasses.
My best friend Brandon told me to day, that he has an appointment for an eye exam.
I asked him why?
Well my mother thinks I squint to much, and hold my book to close to my eyes when I read.
Two days later Brandon came to see me to show me his new glasses.
He looks fantastic wearing glasses and I complimented him on his new look.
I asked him, what it is like wearing glasses?â€‹.
Well I cannot believe the improvement in my vision, but most of all love the sexy feeling I get when I wear the glasses.
I asked Brandon if I could try the glasses.
He handed me the glasses.
Brandon, you re right about the way the glasses feel, I can feel it to, I love that feeling.
When I looked around,  had no problem seeing, and when I looked at myself in a mirror, liked the way I looked.
After Brandon left, I realized wearing glasses might not be all that bad.
Now I am starting to look forward to my annual eye exam in a couple of months, perhaps his time I will be prescribed glasses.

After the summer vacation I will be going into my second year of high school.
This summer I have grown quite a bit taller, and I start to feel more like a man.
Brandon and I are having a great summer, we went camping and played a lot of soccer and baseball and of course did a lot of fishing and swimming.
We like biking and take our fishing poles and picnic lunch and go out for the day.


To day is a beautiful sunny summer day, we decided to go and have a picnic and do some fishing.
We went to our favorite spot, an old quarry, a nice small lake,  very secluded.
Because the fish were not biting, Brandon suggested we do some skinny dipping before we eat our lunch.
I liked the idea, and it did not take us long to get into the water.
We had a wonderful time, the woods all around were nice and quiet, the birds were singing, so peaceful not a soul around. 

                               -------------------------------------------


Hi, I am Andrea, Ashley is my twin sister.
We are a pair of Tom-boy girls.
We just moved here. 
After the summer break will be going into our second year of high school.
We like biking, fishing and always love playing ball.
To day we decided to go for a bike ride and explore another part of the area.
It is a very nice sunny day and we headed for the country.
The country side is beautiful everywhere you look, and makes you appreciate wearing glasses and to be able to see so well.
Ashley hates wearing her glasses and rather squints.
On a nice quiet side road not to far out of town, we noticed a road leading towards the woods. 
We decided to go that way and after a couple of slight curves in the road came upon what looked like a small lake.
It looked like a beautiful quiet spot.
We stopped and sat down on the side of a small hill overlooking the lake.
We enjoyed the song of birds, and hum of flying insects.
When I heard some voices,  I spotted a couple of swimmers.

                                          -------------------------

Brandon, I think I heard something, I am sure there are some people around.
Well there is no use me looking, I am not wearing my glasses
Can you see anybody? 
No, my distant vision is not very good..
Well let s be quiet and get closer to our stuff, and see what happens.


                                        ---------------------------

Ashley, did you see what I just saw?
What did you see?
It looks like a couple of guys skinny dipping
I can t see anything.
Here wear my glasses, and look there, I pointed where I had seen the swimmers.
Yes, I can see them now, what do you think we should do.
Let s try to make them a bit uncomfortable.
I noticed their bikes, let s get over there and make it look as if we have found something.
Ashley handed me back my glasses, and said dam, I should have worn my glasses to day.
I led the way to the other side where the bikes are, and noticed two bundles of clothes and a pair of glasses on top of one of them.
There is a pair of glasses Ashley, why don t you try those glasses, you might be able to see better.
Ashley located the glasses, and put them on.
These glasses are great I can see almost perfect now. 

Then we heard: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?

Oh! is this your stuff, sorry, we did not see anybody around.
We were thinking we found something worthwhile, finders, keepers.
Two guys about our age came closer to the shore, you have to get out of here, we cannot get out of the water, we don t have any clothes on.
I know, I noticed your bare behind.
Well we can t stay in the water all day.
O K, we will be lady like and turn around and we wont look while you put some of your clothes on.
We want to make sure the clothes fit you, otherwise they are ours.
Are you ready?
We will turn around now and promise to be lady like and not peek, you let us know when we can turn around. O K.
Ashley could not stop laughing, and said to me they are most likely looking for the glasses.
I can see so well wearing them, I hate to give them back.

O.K. ladies you can turn around.
When we did, looked at two handsome, soaking wet guys. 
I introduced myself. Hi, I am Andrea, and my twin sister Ashley, who likes wearing your glasses
I don t know if we are glad to meet you, I am Logan and your sister is wearing my friend Brandon s glasses.

Wow, they were pretty girls, we decided to try and be perfect gentlemen.
After our longer than expected swim, we are ready for our picnic lunch, 
Would you ladies like to join us for a picnic lunch.
That would be wonderful, we did not bring any goodies.
So now there we were the four of us eating our lunch.
We soon had some great conversation and started to enjoy getting to know each other.
The biggest surprise came when we found out they lived in a house a near the end of our street.

When we headed for home Ashley asked Brandon if he wanted his glasses back?
No, you can wear them till we get home, I like to find out if you are pulling my leg. 
I like to see, what you look like wearing your own glasses.
I rode beside Andrea, we talked bout a number of subjects and soon realized she is a very smart girl.
When we talked about glasses, she told me that she has been wearing glasses for about two years now,
and at her last exam had another increase in her prescription.
I told her that I expected at my next eye exam I most likely will be told I need to wear glasses, my distance vision is not very good.
I am sure you will look great wearing glasses, I love the looks of a man wearing glasses.
We both noticed Brandon and Ashley were getting along, they even had some laughs.
When we arrived at Andrea s house she insisted we come in for some refreshments,
We met the girls mother, a very pleasant good looking glasses wearing person. 
Before we left, Ashley came wearing her glasses and when she handed Brandon his, said thank you for the loan of your glasses, our prescriptions are almost identical.
Wow, you should wear your glasses all the time, you look beautiful.
On the way home Brandon and I agreed, we both would like to date Andrea and Ashley.

The next day when we were playing some lawn games soon realized that we were not as good as the girls, but told them we wanted them to win.
Hey look at that plane.
I looked up in the sky and told Andrea that I can t see any plane.
She handed me her glasses, try these.
When I put the glasses on, could see the plane.
You sure need glasses. 
I know, I have an appointment for an eye exam next week.

A couple of days later we decided to go and see a movie.
When we were seated Andrea handed me a glasses case and when I took out the glasses, said you better wear them, I don t think you will enjoy watching the movie the way your vision is, by the way these are my old glasses..
I put the glasses on and when the movie started realized I sure needed to wear the glasses.
I thanked Andrea with a big kiss, and realized smooching wearing glasses is a real turn on.

My eye exam. 
Andrea went with me she to make sure I would select good looking glasses.
After my exam, it sure did not take her very long to find the right pair.
When my glasses were ready and I looked at myself wearing them, was glad Andrea had been with me,
I loved my new look.
I received many compliments and love my glasses.

We all are back at school now, Brandon and I enjoy taking the girls out, and they always are our partners at school dances.
Time flies and our summer beak will be starting next week.
We are looking forward to a great summer with the girls.
About a week later two tear eyed girls informed us that their dad had another promotion and they would be moving to the other end of the country.
We had some great times until they moved, but felt lost after they had moved.
The next week Brandon and I decided to go fishing and some skinny dipping.
You never know history might repeat itself.
