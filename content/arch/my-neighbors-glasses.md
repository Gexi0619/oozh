description: Jennifer discovers a neighbor's surprising journey with glasses, prompting her to consider her own vision problems.

My neighbours glasses.


Jennifer, now in her final year of high school, is not a very happy girl lately.
Because of Corona virus, the school has been closed, since the March break.
She really wants to finish high school this year, and receive her diploma, so she can continue her studies, at a higher level, in the fall.
She was happy, that she had, all her necessary books and notes at home, so she could do some studying, but what about the next semester?
Then she was informed, that the final part of her year, would be taught on line.


Staying, in the house all day, is no fun, when you like fresh air.
Walking our dog Casper twice a day was the most enjoyable part of the day.
Walking down the street, with your mask on, in what looks like a deserted neighbourhood, is so quiet, and peaceful, and looking in far away, everything looks hazy.


Studying, when you have a younger sister and brother, is not easy, when you have to concentrate, on your lessons on line.
I never had headaches before, but lately, I found out what headaches are like.


My friend Megan, and I, communicate on our phones, regularly, she is in my class, and she also wants to get, her diploma.
At the present, we are not allowed, to visit each other.
Life is so boring right now.


To day, while walking, Casper, I thought, what looked like a female mask wearing person, coming my way.
I could not recognize her, as she spoke to me, Jennifer, how are you? 
I am fine, but who are you?
I am Sandy, don’t you recognize me?
No, with the glasses and the mask, you did not look familiar.
Sorry, I did not know, you wore glasses.
That’s all right, I started to wear glasses in March.
I was lucky, I had my eyes examined, just before the March break, and I got my glasses, before all the stores closed, because of the Corona virus


How do you like wearing glasses?
I love it, no more headaches, after I have study too long, and my vision, has really improved.
I find the glasses, very comfortable, and easy to wear. 
How are you making out with your studies?
Since I started to wear glasses, I don’t tire the same, as I did before, when I started to wear my glasses, no more head aches.


Walking home, I sure had something to think about, should I be wearing glasses? I had never thought about that, 
I have noticed lately,,that everything far away, does not look as clear and sharp anymore.


The next time, that I talked with Megan on the phone., I told her about Sandy, and her wearing glasses now, and all that she told me.
Jennifer, as you know, my sister Sadie, wears glasses,, because she had a problem, not being able to see everything far away, nice and clear, and I know for sure, she used to have a lot of headaches.
A few months ago, she got new stronger glasses, that is all I know.


Megan, I think, I need to wear glasses, all the things you mentioned, about headaches and distant vision , I now experience.
But all the stores and businesses are closed now. so I will have to wait, and suffer some more headaches, before I can have an eye exam.
Yes, these are sure difficult times, 
Well, they promised us, if we study on line, and pass our final exam , we will get our diploma, so I better get back to work.


I told my mother, about Sandy wearing glasses, and that I had a long talk with Megan, and why her sister is wearing glasses now. 
I think, I should be wearing glasses, after all the information, I have heard, because no , I realize, I have the same symptoms.


My mother, has regular phone conversations, with all her neighbour friends.
She told me, that Mrs. Weber, who wears glasses, thinks I am right, that I should be wearing glasses, she experienced all those symptoms herself, and wearing glasses, solved her problem.
I understand, that she also talked to Megan’s mother, and she now realizes, that I am right, I should be wearing glasses.


My mother, phoned several optometry clinics, but the message was, no eye exams, until some of the restrictions, are lifted.


A couple of days later, Mrs. Weber, phoned us to say, that she had left a package, in our the mail box, with a couple pairs, of her old glasses, and to try the glasses, to see if they might help Jennifer, with her vision problem.


I was all nervous, when I went to the mailbox, to get the glasses.
After taking the two glasses cases, to my room, I sat down at my desk, near the window.
Slowly, I opened one case, and looked at a very nice, female looking, pair of glasses.
I looked them over, and put the glasses on.,and looked around.
I was disappointed, I could not see to well, wearing the glasses, they seemed to strong for me.
When, I tried the second pair, I could not believe, how the glasses, improved my vision.
When I looked out through the window, everything , I looked ar was now, nice and clear.
I did some work on the computer, and had no vision problem.
The glasses, were sure comfortable to wear, I got up, to look at myself in the mirror, and sure liked my new glasses wearing look.


I showed, my mother, how I looked wearing glasses, and to tell her how well, I could see wearing the glasses.
I noticed my younger sister looking at me, I could tell, by the look on her face, that she would like to try the glasses, so I handed her the glasses, to wear.
When Sarah was wearing the glasses, told us, she could not believe, how well she could see, wearing the glasses.
What a surprise, I never expected that, Sarah, might be myopic..


I wore the glasses all day, and no headaches., and now wear the glasses all day, what a pleasure, to be able to see and no headaches.


A few days later, I received Megan’s sister, old glasses.
When I tried the glasses, I noticed right away, they were not as strong as the glasses I have been wearing, and my vision was not as good.
I called Sarah, and she came ito my room, Sarah, here are a pair of glasses for you.
After she put the glasses on, asked me if she could wear the glasses all the time, they are perfect, I can see everything so much better now.
Yes, you can wear the glasses, I have a good pair already.


Having a second pair of glasses available, soon had me wearing the stronger glasses, more and more, and by the
time, some restrictions were relaxed, I was wearing the stronger glasses all the time.


My mother made appointments for eye exams for us, but we had another to wait three weeks, and by that time I had written my final exams, and had passed , and will receive my diploma.


At the eye exam, after explaining to the optometrist about the glasses, I was wearing, she told me that the glasses I had been wearing, ,were about, the right prescription, except a slight change in the sphere and axis.


I am so proud of my nice new glasses, and will enjoy my glasses wearing look even more, when we don’t have to wear our masks anymore, then, everybody can see my nice glasses wearing , smiling face,
