Back to school

Everybody was glad to be back at school and see all their friends and getup to date on all the news.
Jim was happy with his homeroom teacher, and signed up for football and track and field.
Marsha and Peggy were again in the same class, Marsha signed up for track and field and the band.

All the girls were looking at the boys and all the boys at  the girls to see who was new and what was new.
It was noticeable that more students were wearing glasses compared to last year. Some   of the girls had changed their hair 
color and looked different.
Everybody was full of talk and laughter, had gossip and talked about new experiences.
Try some ones new glasses or comment on clothes and hair.

The next day at the track around the football field the runners were getting ready. They were to run 2 miles.
Marsha was used to running and had no problems with that.She was going her regular speed and noticed that quite a few 
lagged way behind.
There were a couple of boys catching up to her, and soon jogged at her speed.
One of the boys was Jim, he could not remember ever seeing Marsha around and was very impressed by her performance.
She gave him a big smile when he jogged along side of her, and he smiled back.
After the running was finished she had a shower and went home.
On the way home she wondered who that good looking guy with the glasses was, she would like to see him again.
When she went running the next day Jim came over to Marsha and introduced himself and asked if he could run with her
of course she said yes and off they went.
They ran together everyday and become sort of friends.
The next week when they were jogging ,Jim asked Marsha if she would like to go to the movies with him.
She was thrilled and said yes  they were to meet Saturday  at 2  in the mall at the food court.

When Saturday came Jim had an appointment to get his eyes checked and to get contact lenses, he did not want to play football wearing glasses.When they eye test was finished, Jim had to get new glasses,as there was a change in his prescription from - 1.25 to -2.00 for both eyes.
With the help of the optician Jim picked out a pair  of stunning frames. His glasses would be ready in about an hour,
so Jim went for a burger and wait.

Marsha was getting ready for her date and spent extra time on her hair and make up, and after showing herself to her mom for inspection went to the bus stop to go to the mall.

She arrived at the foo court a few minutes early and spotted Jim waiting for her. for some reason he looked more handsome
than before.

After greeting each other she noticed he wore different glasses, she asked if they were new. Jim said yes they were.She complimented him on his good choice and told him they looked fantastic. he said thank you you look fantastic yourself.

They went to the theater and picked out seats a few rows from the back.Marsha had not been to a movie for a while
and was really excited.
After the movie started Marsha thought the picture was out of focus, it seemed fuzzy.
She asked Jim about it ,he thought everything was fine . He looked at Marsha and saw that she was squinting. He asked her if she had trouble seeing where she was , she told him the last time she saw a movie she sat closer to the front.
did you ever have your eyes tested,she said she never had an eye exam.
She remembered trying Peggy s glasses, she told Jim that when she tried Peggy s glasses everything seemed clearer.
Jim a
said Marsha I think you need glasses,I might be able to help you,I have my old glasses in my pocket, they are my last 
prescription and not to strong, why don,t you try them. He brought out the glass case with his old glasses and handed them to Marsha.She took the case took out the glasses and put them on. She could not believe the difference they made and 
told Jim she could see just fine with them.
Marsha I think you need glasses and she said I am afraid I do.

They watched and enjoyed the movie and when it was finished walked out of the theater Marsha still wearing Jim,s old glasses, they worked so well and were so comfortable she forgot all about them.
Jim started to laugh Marsha you seem to like my glasses, than she realized she had forgotten about them and started
to laugh.
When they sat down for a drink she said I need to get my own glasses, will you still like me?
Jim laughed Marsha you looked good in my old glasses, I love to see you inn your own
After the drink they walked to the bus stop,Jim saw Marsha off as he lived in a different direction.

Marsha wondered what now , nobody in her family wore glasses or anything about them,  she would check with Peggy on Monday.
