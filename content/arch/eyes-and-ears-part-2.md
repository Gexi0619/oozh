EYES and EARS  part 2 


When I arrived the next morning I looked at my appointments and noticed that my receptionist had made a late appointment for Ms Johnson,when I queried this she explained that ms Johnson's sister had mentioned that she thought her sister did not hear as well as she used to.so It might take me longer.than the 20 mins slot.
The morning went very fast and I was looking forward to Ms Johnson appointment I had just finished my afternoon cup of tea when my receptionist said that Ms Johnson had arrived 30 mins early.
I asked if her reading glasses were ready yet,if so I could see her now as I had no more appointment for the rest of the day and if any new patent came my assistant could look after them. 
Susan my receptionist showed Ms Johnson in and handed me a box with the reading glasses in.
There was a note on the top.Susan had rung the agency to get permission for a second pair of glasses for reading but they had refused so she had felt sorry for Ms Johnson and had found a pair of round blue metal NHS frame with cable temples we could use as she understood the patient had no money,and the sister would pay a small amount each month for the lens.
When I opened the box I was surprised at the thickness of the lens then I remembered I had added a 6 out prism to each eye for reading as this seemed to help with close work.
Good morning Ms Jhonson how are you,
“Please call me Vanessa,I don't know how to thank you enough,my glasses are wonderful and I not had a headache,I feel 6 foot tall ha but I'm Getting used to it.Susan explained it all I am so grateful for what you doing” 
I have your new reading glasses here for you, we put them in different frames for you,so let's see how they fit.
I gently put them on for her and hocked the cable temples behind her ears.and gave her the card to hold “,wow that's so clear I couldn't see to read the paper last night with my pink glasses on”she exclaimed.
You won't see very far in them so you have to be careful walking,but if you can manage ok then keep them on and we will go into the other room and test your hearing.
We will test each ear separately like we did with your eyes 
“I'm scared my sister is always shouting at me and says I not listen to her, and says I will never get a job and will have to go back home. do you think I'm deaf”. .
No you not Deaf you might be a little hard of hearing but we can do somthing about that.
“Will I need a operation”.
No we have hearing aids it like having glasses to help you see but things that you wear over your ears to help you hear better. 
Ok let's start now as soon as you hear a pip press the button if you not sure it's ok don't worry some will be louder than others and some you might not hear. 
All done now I will get Susan to take you back in my room and get your a coffee and Biscuits,while I take this down to the lab then I come and talk to you.

That's all sorted now,
You do need some help hearing especially in your right ear.
“Oooo am I Deaf”. 
No but you have lost a lot of your hearing on that side and some on the left.
The problem we have is the agency won't pay, the government won't help and I know your sister can't pay,but without them you won't get a job as I can't complete this form from the agency.so we need to think of something,but first we need to get you fitted with 2 hearing aids and see how you feel.
You enjoy your coffee there are some magazine there you can try your reading glasses out, I need to talk to Susan.

Are you free Susan?
My nanny gave her notice in this morning she has to return home to the Philippines her mother is very ill and she wants to go this weekend I was wondering if Vanessa might be able to help look after my children after school and do the cooking and cleaning.The agency said if we took her off their books they would still pay for her glasses and our time,and not charge for their time, then she could pay a little each month for her hearing aids.
Susan smiled “it's strange I was just thinking the same she seems a very pleasant girl”
“When you interviewed me we went to that small restaurant”.
“Why don't you talke her their it was more relaxing and I found it easy to tell you all about myself”.
Ok if you happy about it then after I fitted her hearing aids I will suggest she try's them outsides and take her to the restaurant.
Are you ready to try these Vanaser?  I have just put temporary buds on the end they help until we will get some proper moulds made for you.
“O! they are strange I have never seen anything like that will it all go inside my ear”.
Haha no dear that part hooks over your ear the tube then goes inside your ear with this piece on the end I think you had better put your pink glasses back on now.
That's both fitted I will turn one on at a time if it's to loud tell me.
“What's that strange notice I can hear over by that wall”.
It's the clock ticking 
I think we had better try them outside now it will sound very loud at first, we can go the the small restaurants over the road and sit down I have things to talk to you about.
