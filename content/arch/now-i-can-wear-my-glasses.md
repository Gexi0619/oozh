Now I can wear my glasses.




I wear glasses, I am a low myopic, with a -1.75, prescription.
Most of the time, I wear contact lenses.
I wear my glasses, if I wear them, at home only.
Nobody, except my immediate family, knows I wear glasses.
Believe it or not, but I always figured, I had prefect vision.
My parents, wear cheap drugstore glasses to read, nobody in our family ever had an eye exam, except now me.
I would not have had the eye exam, but I had to, when I went to renew my drivers license, about a year ago., failed the vision test.
The optometrist, when he did my exam, told me that he had noticed lately, there are quite a few people in their early twenties, who are myopic now.
I chose to wear contacts, because I am sure sure, most guys, looking for a girl, don't like to see them wearing glasses.
I also have glasses, that I wear at night, to give my eyes a rest.
I consider myself, a good looking girl, I have a good figure, with a nice bust line, a nice head of dark blond hair, that I always, have looking very nice.
The insurance office, I work in, has a large number of glasses wearing employees, both male and female.
The only time that you hear a comment about glasses, when somebody shows up, wearing glasses,
who did not wear glasses. before.
Usually they are compliments, how nice they look wearing glasses.


My girlfriend and I decided, we go to a singles bar, where they have a dance floor.
We both thought, that we looked our best, when we arrived at the singles bar.
Because we did not want to look like ladies of the night, we sat at a table, not to far from the bar.
By the looks of it, it was going to be a busy night.
It was busy all right, and we soon noticed, that there were some people walking around, trying to find a table, that was free.
A few minutes later, two very handsome guys asked us, if we would mind some company.
We asked them to sit down, and they introduced them selves, the guy I liked the looks of, was Andrew, the other one was Tim, Jenny is her name, and my name is Amy 
They bought us a drink, and asked us for a dance.
We accepted, and lucky me, Andrew asked me.
He was an excellent dancer, and very easy to talk to, and we both enjoyed each others company.
I was happy to see, that Tim and Jenny seemed to get along well.
When it was time to go home, Andrew asked me for a date, which I accepted, and I told him where I lived. 
On the way home Jenny told me, that Tim had asked her for a date, and she was so happy, she likes him.


On our first date we went out , to a very nice, Italian restaurant, enjoyed the meal and got to know each other a little more.
I like Andrew, he is well mannered, has a good job, and I find him easy to get along with.
The only thing that worries me, he told me he hates, the looks of glasses on women, I wonder how I can manage to wear my glasses, when he is around?


On our next date we went to see a movie, and liked to sit closer to the front. After the movie when we had some refreshments, Andrew complained on having a head ache. 


A few weeks later, after we had some more dates, and started to get to know, each other a little better, I noticed Andrew was not in a very good mood.
I asked him, if I had said something, to upset him?
No, Amy, it is not your fault.
Well tell me about it, perhaps I can help you.
No, Amy you cannot help me.
Are you sure? let me in on your secret.
Well Amy, if you want to know, I will tell you.
I had to go and get my drivers license renewed, before it expired, and I had to take the vision test, which I failed, and now won't get a renewal, unless I wear glasses.
I know they are wrong, I have perfect vision, but I have only 2 weeks left, to go back and get my license.
Well, That is not the end of the world, go and get an eye exam, and get it done.
But, I don't want to wear glasses, I hate the look of glasses..
Andrew, you make a mountain out of a mole hill.
I think, you might be surprised, how handsome you can look wearing glasses.
Why don't we go to the optical store in the mall, and see, what you might look like wearing glasses, I think you will be surprised.


When we walked into the optical store, I talked to the optician, made an appointment for Andrew, to make sure it was done. then I asked her, if she could show Andrew some frames, to show him, that he can look very handsome wearing glasses.
The optician smiled, and said to me, he won't believe, how good he can look wearing glasses.
The optician had a good look at Andrew, then walked over to the displays, and pulled out some frames.
Andrew, put on the frames, and looked at himself, 
Amy you were right, I sure look different, but I think I like that look 
Andrew I think you look fantastic, those frames sure suit you, I told you you would.
Well, do you feel a little better now, having to wear glasses?
Yes, I guess, I feel a little better now.
Well the appointment for your eye exam, is for to morrow after work.
Amy, I like to see you try a few frames, to see how you look wearing glasses
I had spotted some frames, almost identical as my glasses, so I showed him how I look wearing glasses.
Amy, I like that look, I never thought, glasses could look so good, I sure like how you look wearing glasses.


Andrew went for his eye appointment, and when the optometrist showed him the difference when wearing glasses, and before could not believe it.
Now Andrew wanted to wear his glasses, to be able to see so much better. 

Andrew was almost like a child, when he asked me to come with him to wear his new glasses.
After, having been fitted, when he looked around, could not believe how much better his vision was wearing the glasses.
He looked at himself in the mirror, and was all smiles, he liked his new look.
Amy, you have no idea what it is like, to see so much better.
Yes, Andrew, I know, and put my glasses on.
You wear glasses? yes Andrew, I started about a year ago, when I failed the driving test, but have been wearing contact lenses most of the time, because I knew, there would be guys like you, who don't like a girl who wears glasses.
Amy, I was so wrong, I know it now, you can wear your glasses all the time, I really like the way you look wearing glasses.
