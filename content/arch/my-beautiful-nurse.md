description: "In a twist of fate, a man's expectations of his new nurse are shattered when he meets Anne."
---
I am Andrews brother.

I had been in Hospital for 3 months recovering from a car crash,the time had gone so slowly,
But today was the day I was going home,my sister had arranged for a private nurse to come and be my live in Career,
My sister was very kind but had very poor eyesight and looked after our elderly  mother,
I had not meet the nurse yet but my sister said that she had worked at the hospital and her contract had just finished,so she needed work,and had agreed to come and look after me.
O I thought she must be an old battle axe.
In my dreams she would have been a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair and glasses.
When I got home my sister was waiting for me,and helped get my wheelchair in through the door and me into the armchair.
Then she said “Annabelle is in the kitchen making you a cup of tea”.
“I hope you told her not to put any milk in it and plenty of sugar”.
I was in a bad mood and ready to attack the battle axe that was making my tea.
The kitchen door opened  my mouth dropped open and I was speechless
A voice said “hello I'm Annabelle,but call me Anne”.
H h hel hello  I stuttered 
Anne was not the girl of my dreams but neither was she the battle axe that I was expecting.
She had a nice slim body, long brown hair and a strange but sweat smile,but NO glasses,
My sister had brought a bed downstairs for me and made  the dining room into a bedroom, and put Anne  upstairs in the spare room,my sister told Anne she could go to her room and unpack as she had had a long train journey.
The next morning my sister and Anne help we go to the bathroom and then get dressed.
After breakfast my sister said Anne “please look after Antony for me while I'm away”.
About 11 o'clock Anne asked if I would like a coffee in the sun room.
She pushed me into the sunroom and I invited her to join me .
Anne seemed a very pleased girl,I wondered why she had left the hospital job, but thought it a little soon to question her,and my sister had said she was ok .

Can you get my pipe and tobacco pouch please it's in my case still I think.
Will you fill the pipe for me 
“I'm a non  smoker” she said ,but the tobacco smells much nicer than cigarettes” 
Are you ok I said you seem your eyes are watering.
“It's ok” she said “some of the smoke got in to my eye, “If I rub it my contact lens will come out”

Ooo things are getting better I said to myself.

Why don't you take it out and get your glasses,
I don't have any glasses I have worn a contact lens since I was 12 
My contact prescription is - 28 I would look so ugly wearing glasses.
I gave her a tissue,she took the contact lens out and dried her eye and put it back in,
“Your right eye is still watering ,you had better dry that as well”
“Please don't look at me while I take my prosthetic eye out”.I think I have an infection behind it as well.

Holly shit what has my sister found for me 

“Should you not leave it out if it's infected”
“Yes but I need this job so I have to wear it.when I'm at home on my own I don't wear it”.
“This is your home for now,if you are going to work for me I think we have to except each other as we are”.

“So you had better go to the bathroom and take it out and your contact lens”
“If you look in your bedroom chest of drawers there are lots of my sisters old glasses,they might be to strong for you but I expect some of the older ones might do for now”.

10 mins later Anne came down holding her hand over her right eye.
“Did you find a pair” I asked 
“Yes I looked at all the ones in the draw,but the pair on the bedside table were best”
They are my sister latest prescription. Aren't they to strong for you “
“They are very good I can see better than my contact lens“
“You can't work one handed you had better take your hand away from your face dear”.
I was shocked I thought her prosthetic eye was like a hard contact lens covering her eye.
But her right eye had been completely removed and there was just a jelly looking skin were her eye had been.
My heart was pounding.
I just said “I hope that feels better shall we have lunch in the garden.
After lunch Anne said “ would you like your pipe,I know I must have spoiled it for you when the smoke got under my contact and prosthetic”
I watched Anne fill my pipe with tobacco she placed it between my lips and light in for me.
I had expected her to sit further away,but instead she sat next to me letting the smoke drift around her and up her nose,”I love the aroma of the tobacco,it reminds me of my grandfather”she said.
I was mesmerised by her looks, there was a strange beauty with my one eyed nurse.
This became our regular morning routine,but today she looked very stressed.
What is the problem I asked 
“It's the end of my 2 weeks trial,when do you want me to leave.
You have been very kind to me and not making me wear my prosthetic,but I'm sure I must look grostest with only one eye and wearing glasses.
I was shocked I did not know my sister had taken Anne on a trial.  
“I expect your sister has found out now why I left the hospital.
“You had better tell all about it then I will decide,it's my home and I pay you”
Anne explained that she could not read the small print on the medicine bottles and had got the wrong medicine out,luckily the nursing sister noticed what she had done,but her contract was not renewed.
“I hope you have not given me the wrong medicine I said.
She smiled and said “ no it's ok I found a small magnifying glass in the draw with your sister old glasses”.
I laughed and gave her a tissue to dry her eyes.
This was the first time I had seen her bear eyed.
It was obvious that Anne had very little useful sight In her one eye as there was a blank looking expression on her face.
I found this incredibly exciting.
You had better get ready while I ring the opticians and then get a taxi ordered.
Have you a case to put your prosthetic eye in.
“But I can't go out like this”she said “I must put it in and my contact.I have never been outside with glasses and without my prosthetic in.
 I did not want to upset her so I said nothing.

When we got to the opticians the lady asked us some questions showed us into the doctors.
“How are you Tony I hear you had an accident” he said 
“Not seen your sister for a long time”
This is Anne my nurse she has a problem .
Anne explain what was the problem.
Ok he said “you better go over there and take your contact out and your prosthetic”
Anne felt her way back to the chair.
The doctor examined both eyes with a bright light 
Then picked up her prosthetic and said “ how long have you been wearing this,when did you last have it cleaned and polished
Anne looked shocked, I was born premature and have always been blind in that eye but had it removed about 5 years ago,I did not know it needed cleaning and polishing.
Um “well young lady you won't be wearing that or your contact for a very long time you have very bad infection in both eyes,it's glasses for you from now on,
Mark told me that you had been wearing his sister spare glasses so let's start with that,he placed the test frames onto Anne and looked up my sisters prescription and add the lens to the frame. 
“Ok what lines can you read for me now”
Just the top 2 was the reply .
Many more lens were tried and then she had to say we're the red line was.or in her case wasn't.
Then she was given a card to read and he. Change some of the lens 
“All done he said,who gave you these contact lens, you should never  have been wearing them I'm surprised you could see anything”
“I ordered them myself off the internet I keep ordering stronger ones
But these were the best I could get without a prescription”

“Your prescription is very complicated so we will have to order the blanks for your new glasses but I will get my lab to make you a pair.to help you u till the your are ready for you”
“You can keep these test frames on while you are waiting and go upstairs for a coffee”
This is your prescription keep it save.
I looked at it 
Right eye Plano or opac
Left eye -32.50 -4.25 180 Add 3.75 prism out 15

And hour later the lady called us back in and said they had managed to make a pair for Anne,but they could not do the add part of the prescription
But had managed with the full distance prescription and had fitted a fresnel stick-on prism on the lens 
To save cost they had fitted a Plano lens for her blind eye and the right lens was Very thick with many rings on it, the lady explained it was the stick on fresnel lens that made it look like that.
The doctor told her he wanted to see her again in 3 months to see how she was getting on the these glasses before deciding what to do about a permanent pair pair. But her reading glasses would me ready next week.
Anne was surprised how well she could see but was not happy how she looked.
And said “I wish they had made the lens for my blind eye the same as my left eye it look strange with one very thick lens and the other so thin”.
But I explain that she should not worry as I did not mind and was happy to give her a 2 year contract.
With that she gave me a big hug and a long kiss on my lips 
I have never worn glasses outside since I was 12 and never been seen  without my prosthetic in.
“I think you must get used to wearing glasses now dear,the eye doctor said he can't get contacts in the prescription you need and also you could go blind in that eye..the infection is very bad in both eyes.
“When I told my boyfriend I had to have my right eye removed he never contacted me again and blocked my number 
“Never mind I said his loss and my gain”
Anne gave me her little smile.  

When we got home.Anne said “I must try putting these drops in its not easy with only one eye”
“Would you like me to do it for you”
“Do you really not mind looking at my eye”
“Of course not dear,
I gently pulled her bottom eyelid down and put drops into her right eye first.
“It was so nice you touching my eye,I'm so ashamed about it
“But when you are here I'm happy to see you just like this”

After lunch I said “I think I would like to go to the mall and have a beer do you want to get some food for tonight”
“Do you need some personal things?Take my wallet and buy what you need”
“O I nearly forgot there is a tobacconist near can you get tobacco,and a new pipe”.
“What sort do I buy”
“You choose”I said
“Don't be shy you are a very pretty girl”
An hour later she returned with many bags
“How did you manage dear,how were your glasses”
“It was great seeing to walk around and do the shopping it so easy to see,except I could not read any small print so I hope all is ok”
“Don't worry you will be ok when you get your reading glasses”

When we got home Anne turned the TV on for me and went into the kitchen to unpack,it was nice watching her,she seemed a much happier girl now, then I noticed she seemed very interested in the new pipe she had bought me,she was gently fingering it,then she shyly put it to between her lips,she carried on putting the shopping away with the pipe still in her mouth.as she turn she suddenly saw me watching her,
Before she had time to say anything I said “are you going to put some of the new tobacco into it” you can keep it in your mouth if you want to while you fill it”.
“Do you want to try smoking it”
“But I have never smoked before”
“If you hold my pipe for me while I fill it ”,then we can both smoke together” I said.
“Come over here dear and I will light it for you”
“Come and sit closer”.
“What are you doing,why are you taking my glasses off,you know I'm nearly blind in the only eye I have got”.
“You don't  need to see anything Anne,just lay back and relax”.
“Remember  to suck it slowly to start with, don't inhale it to deep or it might go down your throat”
“Very good dear, you don't need to hold it with your hands,just hold it between your lips and enjoy the taste”.
“That's such a lovey warm feeling in my mouth It's so nice””she said 
Anne was a fast learner,
When we had both finished Anne took my pipe and gently wiped it and said said “that was very nice, I never knew pipe smoking could give me so much pleasure can we do it again tomorrow” 

A few days later the opticians rang to say Anne's reading glasses were ready.
When we arrived, Robert the optician, said “your brother Andrew was in here yesterday with his partner Mary.she has very little sight left in her right eye now.she uses a white cane to help her.
Anne looked upset,if I broke my glasses I think I would need a cane as well,but I haven't got one,What happened to her”
I said I would explain when we got home.(see Andrews story))
When Robert got Anne’s reading glasse out of the case,Anne screwed her face up”why have they got a scratch all the way across the lens”
“Ha no Anne! It's a executive bifocal, the top part of the lens is for seeing a computer ,you will only see about one meter and ,the bottom part is for reading.
“So will I  need to change them if I want to walk around”
“Yes I'm afraid so”.
But that will be a pain when I'm cooking,everything will be so clear close but I can't see to walk.could I have a white cane like Mary for in the house”
Robert looked at me, 
“Please Antony, can I have one, then if I broke my other glasses I could still help you,I don't want you to send me away.
Anne folded up the cane  that Robert gave her and put it in her bag.

When we got home Anne asked if it was ok to use the computer,she wanted to tell her mum she was staying with me and was very happy,
She looked excited as she put her new reading glasses on.
“This is wonderful Tony I can't ever remember seeing like this before”
When she had finished she opened her bag, I expected her to get her glasses case out and change into her distance glasses,but instead she pulled out her folding cane that Robert had given her and said “do you mind if I try using this,I would Like to practice with it”.
Anne was singing in the kitchen while she was getting our meal ready,it was oblivious that she enjoyed wearing her new reading glasses,it did not seem to matter that she could not see very far, when she wanted to go the the store cupboard she picked her white cane and found her way across the room.she said it was so much easier reading the receipt books and looking at the weighing scales.
