Please read part one first 

“Well if you want to turn the white lies into fact then you had better take your shorts off so I can play with your stump when we get home dear xx hug and you still have 7 more cigarettes to smoke yet today hahaha.”
“Can you push yourself back to the car and I will go and pick up your new glasses”
“Hello Jhon  we only had red colour in in children's rubber framed glasses I found the biggest size frame we had for June,I decided to fit them with.
R+32 5.35 180’ Prism out 14
L +16  2.25 120 prism out 8
“With this prescription june will see a ressemble distance but will still see very  big print”
“I know the right lens bulges out much more than the left ,but June has very little sight in that eye now”
“That OK Robert I know they look strange but as long as she can see that's all that matter”


“You go and lay on the settee dear I will get us a glass of wine”.
“You are so nice to me” 
“JHON WHY are you taking my glasses off, please DON'T do that you know I hate being blind”
“Where are you JHON,I can't see anything ,please come back”
“It's ok dear I'm here 
“I thought you could try your new glasses that we got you for wearing in bed dear”.
“Thank you Jhon,they feel very comfortable,I don't think they will fall off in the night and if I want to go to the bathroom I won't have to feel around looking for my glasses,are you sure you don't mind me wearing them in bed John”
You look very sexy wearing them dear,you can wear them all the time if you want to, I love the bright red colour”.
“Oooo I never thought a man would want to touch my stump” 
“Jhon your tongue feels so nice 
“I feel nervous Jhon,I'm still a virgin,would you mind if I tried smoking at the same time”
If you want to dear but you have to learn how to hold it in your mouth with your lips xxxx
“I feel more relaxed now,I never knew smoking a cigarette was so nice”
“My breasts are not very sexy Jhon,they very floppy without a bra on.i know men like firm breasts that stick out,but mine are long and just hang down like cows udders  sorry”
“I never had my breasts played with before,I have always been ashamed of them. Are you trying to milk me Jhon”
“Saggy is sexy dear it means they are real”
She took another long drag on her cigarette plumbs of smoke were still exhaling out of her nose 
“Jhon.i feel all weak and can't stop shaking”
“You were so kind and loving Jhon, I feel strange my head is spinning and my legs feel like jelly,but I feel happy,It was so nice being able to see you Jhon I love my new glasses”
“You look lovely wearing them dear”

I had noticed that June was spending more time in her wheelchair
than walking on her crutches now, when I asked her why she said her left leg was hurting more now,we're they had fitted the steel pins after the accident,
So today we had an appointment at the hospital
They took a lot of X-rays of her left leg and her right stump,which had become very red over the last month.

We were called into the surgeons office.
“Well June there are a few problem that we need to sort out.
Because  we have not managed to fit you with a prosthetic right leg you are putting all your weight on the left leg.
So I suggest we get you fitted with a full leg brace for that leg.
Also you have a very bad infection in your stump.I think we need to do a further operation and remove the rest of that leg with a hip disarticulation amputation then we can fit you with a waist cast and a peg leg”
“If we don't sort the left leg then I fear that we might have to amputate it above the knee as well”.
When we got home June looked very upset,I told her not to worry,I'm sure the leg brace will help you a lot and I don't mind,
If they can fit you with a peg leg then its best to get the rest of your right leg amputated.
“But won't I look even more disabled without any leg at all.
No dear I can still kiss you where you have had the hip disarticulation amputation”
The next week June was fitted with a full leg brace,as it need to support her hips as well, the brace was attached to a waist support.made of glass fiber and on the right side of it were the attachments to fit her prosthetic peg leg later.
The steal braces had been sprayed red with black leather straps and fitted to black shoes.
June was pleasantly surprised,they showed her how to lock it in place for standing and how to release it for sitting.
I told her she looked very sexy wearing it.
It took her a few days to get used to it but all the pain had gone and she found it much easier standing and walking with her crutches.

2 months later we returned to the hospital for June to have the rest of her right leg amputated,
When June had her accident her right leg had been crushed so the amputation had not been very tidy there were deep scars and her stump was a strange shape at the end,It was also twisted.and had started to shrink.
I gave her stump one last kiss,and went to the waiting room 
The next day June was awake and feeling ok.
I had brought her rubber framed bed glasses in for her.i carefully put them on for her and tighten the back strap.
She was so pleased to be able to see again and they would not fall off if she slept 
As the nurse removed the bandages
I could not believe what a wonderful job the surgeon had done with the hip disarticulation amputation it  looked as if June had been born with no right leg,all the stitching had been done at the.back,you could not see that there had ever been a leg there and no ugly scars.
“That looks much nicer dear “
June had been fitted with a catheter after the operation.as she was having  a problem controlling her bladder,she had always had to wear panty pads since her accident as sometimes she would leak.

June had been home for a month, her hip disarticulation amputation had healed nicely,so I suggested that she should start walking again and wear her leg brace,

After they had done the amputation of her stomp they had made a cast of her right hip and joined it to the waist support.
So first I had to strap her into the waist cast then lay her on her back and clip the steel leg brace onto it.
Next I strapped her left leg into it and laced up her shoe
All of this I had done many times, but now I had to attach her peg leg to it .
The peg leg was red and to make it lighter there was no foot to it just a black rubber pad at the bottom to stop her slipping then I strapped the catheter bag to  the steel leg brace.
I gave June her crutches to help her to stand 
The peg leg had no knee joint it was just straight so I locked her left steel brace in to the straight position for her to stand then released it for her to walk.
I said “remember you have to swing your peg leg forward to walk”
“Im scared Jhon can I have a cigarette please”
I was worried about the amount of cigarettes she was smoking now so I had bought her a red cigarette holder I put a cigarette into it and put the holder into her mouth and light the cigarette for her,instantly she started taking long heavy drages  
She had to use both hands for her crutches,so she had to leave the cigarette holder hanging from the corner of her bright red lips.

She looked very sexy standing there on her right peg leg with her left leg braced the thick lens were bulging out of the red rubber glasses making her eyes look Huge.The holder with the long marlboro 120 cigarette in it was not just hanging there anymore but was sticking straight out as she sucked hard on it.
She took another long deep drag on her cigarette,
Then she swung her peg leg forward for the first time.
large plums of white smoke poured out of her nostrils.

I was holding her from behind as she swung the peg leg forward.
Then for the first time she put all her weight on her peg leg as she lifted her braced
“JHON JHON I can walk again” 
Each time she put her weight on her braced leg she took another long hard drag on the cigarette. Then as she swung her peg leg forward she exhaled plumbs of smoke from her nose into the air.
She looked in the mirror smiled .”O Jhon I look Like a Robot my eyes look so big but I love my red rubber glasses if I fall I won't lose them,is it ok if I wear them when we go out”.
“Yes dear of course,if they help”
“They look very sexy dear and you don't look cross eyed now”
 “Do you mind that my right eye look much bigger than the other Jhon”
“I love the way you look dear,
After practising at home and in the garden for a month June could now walk using only one walking stick.if she was tired we would take her peg leg off and then she needed her crutches.

I loved to see June walking on her peg leg,she had no pain now that her other leg was braced,the only worry I had was that she had now become a chain smoker whenever she was walking her cigarette holder never left her mouth before she stood she light a cigarette as soon as she had fished one cigarette she instantly replaced it with another without taking the holder out of her mouth.

Today was going to be the first time June had gone out In Public wearing her peg leg.
We decided to go to  the park it was her her favourite place.
“Do you mind if I wear my red rubber framed glasses I feel safer wearing them I know they won't fall off,can you tighten the strap a little at the back”
As we parked our car June asked me to get a packet of Marlboro reds.I was a little surprised.
“Why do you want them dear you normal smoke menthol lights”
“I very nervous! please don't get cross with me,I want to try them,I read they are much stronger you know smoking helps me”
When I returned I helped June out of the car, she looked very nervous, 
“Can I have my cigarette holder please,will you put a marlboro red in it for me please and light it for me”
“JHON Please be QUICKER I NEED TO SMOKE I CANT STOP SHAKING 
As soon as I light it June starting taking long heavy drags on it one after another,never stopping to exhale.
She just stood there for a few minutes looking glazed eyed.
“That feels better thank you Jhon,please don't grumble at me”
 “I want to try walking to the cafe now,can you light me another cigarette”
“Smoking  while I walk helps me concentrate,I rather like the Reds”
“You are walking very well now dear,I think soon you might not even need a walking stick”
“Is that your friend Susan over by the cafe”
“I don't know Jhon I can't see that far” 
“Hello June so nice to see you again, you are walking very well,how long have you had your Peg leg and I see your left leg is braced as well now, the colour matches your peg leg”
“About 3 months now, I had to have the rest of my right leg amputated at the hip,so I don't have any leg that side now,and it's much better wearing the leg brace it  takes away all the pain on my left leg”
“That's so good for your i'm Very pleased June”
“Can I have another cigarette please Jhon,do you want one Susan”
“I smoke reds now is that OK for you Susan”
“I've never tried them,but if you like them then I'm sure 1 will”
“You have change so much now June you never even smoked before now look at you, I love your red cigarette holder, you seem to have so much confidence”.

Both girls were taking long heavy drags on their cigarette,Susan did a few coughs
,It was obvious she had not smoked reds before.

“How long have you worn glasses Susan”.
“O I only got them this morning,nobody has seen them yet.my boyfriend hates girls that wear glasses, just look at them,I'm sure he will leave me”
See how the right lens bulges out in the middle,and they keep slipping down”

“What has happened Susan,you had perfect eyesight and you used tease me so much about my glasses”.
“I'm sorry June I should not have treated you like that”.
“I fell off my cycle and hit my head,when I woke up in hospital I had big bandages on my head and my eyes were covered, they told me that my rettners had become detached,they managed to save some sight in my right eye,but now I'm blind in my left eye”
“Can I have another cigarette please, they are very strong but It helped I'm so stressed now, I only came out of hospital 2 hours ago but I don't want to go home and face my boyfriend,I'm sure he will not want me anymore so I got the taxi to drop me here first”

“Can Susan come home with us Jhon.we can have a nice meal,together then you can drive her to where she lives”
“Yes that's fine with me,should she text her boyfriend first”
“Can you send the text for me please June,I can't see small print now with these glasses,if I take them off I can't even see the phone”
“Ok Susan,just wait while I put my reading glasses on”
“I did not know you had reading glasses as well, do you think reading glasses would help me”
“I don't know,but try mine to see if they help”
“O that's much better I can manage to read my phone now,I did not realise that your eyesight was so bad June,it makes me feel better I'm not alone and Jhon loves you wearing them”
“Could I try your red glasses,the lens look as thick as my right lens but they don't seem to slip down like mine”
“Ok,but Jhon will have to adjust the back strap for you”
“They feel so secure,mine slip down all the time,I have to keep pushing them up,I'm so scared they are going to fall off,can I get my makeup mirror out of my bag,I want to see what I look like wearing them”
A big smile came across Susan's face.
“My blind eye looks so much bigger now,it's looked so small compared to my right eye in my glasses”
Jhon explained all about it and suggested that another day we take her to see Robert.
“Shall we go back to the car now, can I have my glasses back please Susan”
“Light me and Susan another cigarette please Jhon”
