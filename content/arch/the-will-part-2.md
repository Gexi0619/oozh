READING THE WILL first makes the story more enjoyable.

Besides work and our night course at the university, watching T.V or a movie we enjoyed going out on
the weekends.
We liked to go for a drink at our favorite bar, and meet young people or go to a dance.
We met some nice guys and girls . and had very enjoyable evenings.
Nothing exciting happened for a month or so, until we received a phone call fro my mother , informing us that grandma had died.
It was a sad time , we all went to the funeral , and after the burial , back to  grandma s house for the reading of the will.
Then the lawyer started to read , 
To my only grand daughter Amy , my vanity with everything in it , a trunk in the attic with her name on it , and $ 2000.00
That is all I remember hearing.
The $ 2000.00 would help my bank account and look after a student loan,.
I was far more excited to get the vanity with everything in it ,.
I had always loved the vanity, while sitting on the bench and trying some of grandma s fifties  
and looking in the mirror.
I had an idea what was in the vanity, and wondered what might be in the trunk , but would not find out until it was in my apartment.
Later I was handed the key for the vanity drawers, and I made arrangements to get everything delivered to my apartment.
When the vanity and the trunk arrived at the apartment both Ashley and I were very excited, and could not wait to find out what was in the drawers.
When I opened  the first drawer could not believe the number of glasses cases I saw.
When we started to open them , there were cat eye glasses in many different colors , and a number of different stylish fifties frames , even some with rhinestones. 
When we started to wear all the different glasses , realized  the prescription was almost the same as ours ,so we could wear them anytime.
Ashley and I looked at each other wearing the different frames ands were surprised they looked that good.
When we opened the trunk saw all the old fifties dresses , grandma s wedding dress, purses and other dress up items.
The  great surprise was, when we tried on some of the clothes they fit reasonable well  and looked fantastic.
The next day to work we both wore a pair of cat eye glasses that we liked.
We could not believe the reaction and the comments .
Some of the girls wanted to know where you could buy glasses like that.

Ashley and I made plans to go to the Saturday night dance, and have some fun.
We decided to wear fifties dresses with matching glasses
We looked at all the old pictures and tried to have our hair in the proper style. so we would look perfect fifties style.
It was great fun to get ready, and when  we arrived at the dance were soon the topic of conversation,
The guys were all over us., we had the pick of the crop.
This is how I met Greg, a tall handsome guy, we seemed to click and had a great time/
Greg kept telling me hoe fabulous I looked , loved the glasses and the beautiful dress.
He asked me to have a drink with him.

Ashley was also having a wonderful time with a tall , blond haired glasses wearing guy.
they came over to our table.
Hello, brother, who is the beauty sitting beside you?
Jeff, I like you to meet Amy , and who is the lady with you?
Ashley meet my older brother Greg.

When having a drink ,the boys wanted to know where we got those beautiful glasses and clothes.
I told them the story of the vanity and the trunk, and all the different glasses , clothes and pictures.
I also told them how fortunate we were that all the glasses were about the same prescription as ours., so we could wear all those glasses am
nd were the right size for the clothes.
Greg and Jeff wanted to know more    about the glasses , the both admitted they had a fetish for girls wearing glasses.
We always wear our glasses , we love wearing them, no contacts.
Greg you better get rid of your contacts you heard the lady.
Time went fast , Greg and Jeff drove us home, and after a few good night kisses , it was decided they would come on Sunday to look at the glasses and clothes collection.
Ashley and I agreed we had a great time and were looking forward to Sunday,

Shortly after lunch Greg and Jeff arrived, they brought a big bottle of wine and lots of cheese and crackers  ready for a party.
Greg was wearing his glasses , he looked pretty good , but I think he needed more attractive frames..
While we were drinking wine we showed our glasses collection,
We had to model each of the frames and enjoyed their reaction.
We all had a great time. and during the conversation learned where they worked and what they were interested in besides glasses.
We cooked supper for them, and then sat and watched  a movie 
When they left we made arrangements to meet again.

About a year later Greg asked me to marry him, I accepted, and we started to make arrangements 
for the wedding.
Ashley was the maid of honor , and Jeff best men.
On the day of the wedding I wore grandma s wedding dress, and a pair of glasses with rhinestones.
And when Greg put the  ring on my finger , it was grandma s wedding ring.
My mother could not believe her eyes , she was so surprised about our dresses and glasses , and 
then the wedding ring.
Everybody loved our fifties look , and there were many compliments.

I am really sorry grandma could not see the results of her gift and what they did for me.
I hope she is looking down , I am quite sure she will approve and be smiling.
