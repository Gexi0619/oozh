I still, cannot believe it.


This fall, I am going to High School, and I am really looking forward to it.
Patrick is my name, I have two younger sisters, and we are living on a nice quiet street.
The for sale sign, on the house next door, where my best friend used to live, now reads, Sold.
I wonder who is going to live there now.


I love riding my bike, and going to the park to play ball, with the neighborhood guys. 
Playing ball, is has always been fun, but not so much lately. 
On the way home for lunch, I noticed a moving truck next door, unloading furniture, 
Being curious, to see if I might see a boy my age, I went to the window in the front room., and watched.
When a car drove in , I had trouble seeing, but it looked like a couple of girls, going into the house,.
I could not see the first one,and be sure, if it was a boy or a girl, the second one, a girl, looked to me, that she might be my sisters Amy,'s age.


Later in the afternoon, my mother, asked Amy and me to take a cake, next door to the new neighbors.
We went, and after we rang the bell, an older glasses wearing lady opened the door.
We introduced our selves, and handed her the cake,.
She thanked us, and invited us in, to meet her family.
Here is Heather, she will be going to High School, this fall, and her younger sister Jodi, who will be going into grade 6, which is the same grade as Amy.
I just lately have started, to take notice of girls, and I  noticed, that both girls, had a beautiful head of hair, and also that both wore glasses, which I thought, and I don't know why, made the girls look very attractive. 
I have no idea, why I had noticed the glasses on the girls, I had never looked at glasses before, but for some reason, I really noticed the glasses to day, which seemed to make the girls, sure more attractive looking
Mrs .Campbell, asked us, if we would mind, to come back in the morning, and show the girls the town. 
We will be glad, to show them around, and get them familiar with the area..


The next morning, the girls were waiting for us, and Mrs. Campbell, mentioned that she had given Heather some money, so we could have some refreshments.
We showed the girls the park,  the public, and the High School, the arena, and then walked over to the mall.
After that long walk, we were ready for some refreshments , and we sat down at the food court.
Well let's have a look at the menu board
What would you like to order, Heather asked.
Jodi, gave her order right away, but both Amy and I had trouble reading the menu board, from where we were sitting, we got up, and walked closer, to be able to read, what was available.
When we sat down again, Jodi asked Amy, can't you read the board from here?
No, I cannot read the numbers, and writing all looks fuzzy.
You need to wear glasses, I have no trouble reading all of it
In the meantime Heather came back with our orders, and heard part of the girls conversation.
Jodi, why won't you, let Amy try your glasses?
Good idea, and Jodi handed Amy her glasses . 
Amy slowly and hesitantly, took the glasses, and looked them over, before she put them on.
When she looked around, and then at the menu board, said, I can't believe it, I can read the whole menu nice and clear now . 
Patrick, you should try the glasses, it is unbelievable, how much better I can see, wearing the glasses.
So Patrick, still chewing on a mouth full of food, took the glasses and put them on.
Yes, I can see a little better now, I did not know glasses could do that,
Heather are your glasses the same? 
No, mine are stronger, this is my second pair, Jodi, just started to wear glasses about 4 weeks ago, when we both went for our yearly eye exam., my mother and dad, who both wear glasses, make sure that the whole family has a yearly eye exam. 
We never had an eye exam, perhaps we should be wearing glasses to., said Amy
I now was wondering, is my vision that bad, so I asked Heather, may I try your glasses please, I like to find out, the difference, when trying the stronger lenses.
When I tried Heather's glasses, sure noticed a big difference, I could see better, wearing them, then when I was wearing Jodi's.
Well it looks to me, that both of you, should be wearing glasses.
Are you going to tell your parents?
I think we should, said Amy.
Well, I think both of you would look great wearing glasses, don't you think so Jodie?
Yes, I agree.
What is it like to wear glasses?
Well, most of all your vision is really good, the frames are comfortable to wear, and the first day, that you wear them to school, almost everybody, has a comment.
We finished our snack, and then we continued looking around.


When we walked past the optical store. Amy wanted to go in, she wanted glasses, and wanted l to try some, of the frames, to see how she would look wearing glasses, so I might as well go along, I know, she will convince mother, to arrange for eye exams.
Heather, said we all should go into the optical store, 
I think, she wanted to see, how I would look wearing glasses.
I knew better then to argue with 3 girls, so went along, into the store.
Heather took charge, and told the optician that we were due for glasses, but we wanted to get some idea, which frame, would look best
Before I knew it, I had to try some frames, and listened to all the comments, of how nice I would look wearing glasses.
Amy loved the experience, and cannot wait to get glasses.


As I had expected, my mother made an appointment, for the following Tuesday, for all of us.
I had mixed feelings, I knew my vision, was far from perfect, but what are the guys going to say? When they see me wearing glasses?
Well, I had no choice, the appointment had been made,


Surprise, Heather asked me, if I liked to come with her, to go and see a movie, Saturday afternoon.
I agreed, she was a nice girl, and good company, so on Saturday afternoon we went to the Cinema, in the mall.
When we were seated, in about the center of the theater, and the movie was ready to start, 
Heather handed me a pair of glasses, those are my previous pair, I think, if you wear them, you will be able to see better., 
I am sure you are right, I will give them a try.. 
After the movie had started, when wearing the glasses, Heather asked, well how are they?
The glasses sure help some, but the picture, still is not very sharp.
Here, try mine, and give me yours, how are they now, better?
Yes I like them better, but the picture still does not look, nice and clear..
Good thing, you have an eye exam Tuesday, you sure need glasses, the ones you are wearing, 
are over -2.00, and it looks like your vision is worse then mine.
I can't figure it out, I always thought my vision was good, but during the last year, when we were still in school, I realized that everything in the distance, looked a little blurry., and not as clear.
This summer it has not been the best, I have a hard time, seeing the ball, when playing ball
I have no idea what went wrong,


The only thing , I can think off is, that I grew more than an inch, since spring, and I am still growing
perhaps that is the reason, that my vision has changed.
Now, I am sure, I need glasses, I have no choice, and I will get the verdict, Tuesday, when I have my eye exam.



To be continued.
