description: After trying on her coworker's glasses, Jenny realizes she may need glasses too and gets an eye exam.
---
Jenny had graduated with a degree in law.
She was a very attractive brunette, had a nice figure, great personality and was well liked.
After graduation she started to work at a small law firm , in a medium sized city. She liked the firm she worked for , and the people
she worked with, she enjoyed her job. Jenny, her assistant, was a very friendly , attractive and very capable legal secretary and easy to get along with.
  A few months later on a Monday morning Joanne came to work wearing glasses. Jenny was very surprised as Joanne had never mentioned any vision problems.
Joanne told Jenny that she had been having  headaches and her  Doctor had suggested she get her eyes examined., the result was that she needed glasses, they would help her with her headaches, and she had also noticed that when driving she had trouble seeing the road signs clearly.
Jenny complimented Joanne how good she looked wearing glasses.
Joanne told Jenny that the improvement in her sight was unbelievable.
Jenny asked Joanne that if she did not mind she would like to try her glasses, since she did not know anything about glasses , how they felt wearing them, or what you saw with them.
Joanne handed Jenny her glasses, she carefully handled them , looked at the style and color and then put them on.
The glasses felt comfortable and when looking around everything seemed more clear.
She walked over to the window and looked out and was surprised how well she could see with them, and how clear and sharp everything looked.
She  gave Joanne her glasses back and said everything looked so much better and she wondered why, did she need glasses?
 Joanne said I am very happy with the improvement in my eyesight, and after wearing them this past weekend have not had any head aches, the glasses are comfortable and I am happy to have them.

When Jenny came home that night she was thinking about the experience of trying Joann s glasses. She never had an eye exam and was wondering if she should have one, to get her vision checked.While wearing Joanne s glasses everything seemed brighter and more defined.
She spend some time at the computer to learn more about vision, eye exams and vision problems, and found out that a persons eyesight could deteriorate slowly and a person did not realize it.
So she made an appointment with the Vision Center at the mall for the following Saturday.

She drove to the mall. parked her car and went to the Vision Center. She was greeted by a young lady , who handed her some papers to fill out . When she was finished with that she went into a room to for her eye exam.
The Doctor was a female,very pleasant confident and Jenny liked her and knew she was going to be well looked after.
When the eye exam was finished the Doctor told her  that her eyes were healthy, that she had some astigmatism and was nearsighted.
She showed Jenny with the phoropter  the difference the lenses made in her vision that she had no choice but should wear glasses.
It came as a bit of a shock, she had not expected to need glasses, never even thought of them and did not know if she would like wearing glasses, but she did not seem to have much choice.
She tried different frames to see what she would look like wearing glasses. The optician was very helpful and at last she decided on a half fame pair with a brownish tone to blend with her hair and facial features .
When she came back later to pick up her new glasses, the optician put the glasses on her face and adjusted them, and then asked Jenny to look around, she could not believe the difference how clear and bright everything looked.
She was very happy with the improvement in her vision and when looking in the mirror was happy with her new look.
The glasses seemed to look so much better with the proper lenses  in them.
When she came home she spend a lot of time in front of the mirror and trying make up and eye shadow to see what looked best.
The more she looked at herself the better she liked the new look Jenny
The next week when she went to work Joanne thought she looked terrific, and of course had to try her glasses and they realized the prescription were almost the same.Jenny was happy with her glasses , she liked the looks of them and the feel of them and made her feel more confident

Jenny needed a small adjustment on her glasses and on Saturday went to the Vision center. The optician was busy and asked her to wait. So Jenny spend some time looking and trying frames [which was a lot of fun ] when she noticed a pleasant looking blond girl about her age coming into the store.
The girl went to the reception desk and told the receptionist Kim Harris was in for her appointment.
She was told it would  be a few minutes , so she walked over to the area where Jenny was trying frames.. It did not take long for Kim to talk to Jenny and eventually told her some of her problems.
She could not get her drivers license. renewed without an eye exam, and when her boyfriend found out she might need to wear glasses , dumped her he did not want a girlfriend who wore glasses.
Kim told Jenny she did not want glasses but did not have much choice. Jenny told Kim glasses were not all that bad, besides improving your vision, they could improve your looks and were not that hard to get use to.
Kim was impressed how good Jenny looked wearing glasses and asked her if she would mind help her pick out a nice frame after the exam.
Jenny said she would be pleased to help her and wait. She enjoyed talking to Kim , liked her personalty and felt sorry for her to have all those problems.
When Kim s exam was finished , and was told she needed glasses, cam over to Jenny and together they went to search for the right frame. Kim started to enjoy trying all the frames and thought Jenny was a terrific person.
When at last they had selected a nice brown plastic frame and had all the measurements done  , were told to come back in about an hour and the glasses should be ready.

The girls went to the food court to get a bite to eat. Kim told Jenny that her boyfriend beside dumping her , had told her to get out his apartment, so she had to find a place to live.
Jenny liked Kim and asked her if she would like to stay at her place until she found a place to live.
Kim got up walked over to Jenny and gave her a great big kiss and told her she would love to. They made plan to move Kim s clothes and stuff that afternoon.

They went back to the Vision Center to pick up Kim s glasses.  When Kim tried the new glasses  and had them fitted the optician asked Kim to look around. Kim could no believe the improvement in her eyesight  and looking in the mirror realized she did not look bad wearing glasses.

When they went to Kim s place  to pick up her belongings , her old boy friend told her the glasses looked like shit and he always thought she must be a lesbian because it did not take her long to pick up a female friend.
Kim told him that getting glasses was the best thing that had happened to her, she liked the looks of them , and with her improved vision was able to see the kind of guy he really was, and be glad to be rid of him.
The girls were not long getting out of there and get settled in Jenny s apartment.
They spend the night talking ,trying each others glasses and experimenting with make up, and had a wonderful time.
Kim decided that having to wear glasses was OK, they sure had changed her life in a hurry.

Jenny s apartment had 2 bedrooms all furnished so it was easy for her to have Kim  there.
Kim worked not to far from Jenny s place which was very convenient.
On Monday night the girls talked about their day, Kim said she received many compliments on her new look and some of the girls
had to try her glasses and were envious . They had a great time chatting away while watching TV.
A few days later Jenny asked Kim if she had any luck apartment hunting.
Kim told her that the apartments that were available were either to fancy and expensive, or not fit to live in ,but she would keep on looking.
Jenny suggested that if Kim wanted , she could stay and help share the expenses. Kim said she would love to and they made arrangements and both were happy.
They started to go out together for shopping and once and a while a movie.
A few months later Jenny started to get a head ache more than she was used to, and after the last time when they went to see a movie noticed her vision seemed not as good.
She made an appointment at the Vision Center for the following Saturday.
When the Doctor finished the exam , she told Jenny she had a slight increase  in her astigmatism and also needed stronger lenses 
for her myopia ,which was not unusual to see an increase in a short time, her last exam was almost a year ago, and she was sure this increase would stabilize her eyes.
So now the fun began to find a new attractive frame for her. Kim picked out a a pair of bold plastic frames that Jenny liked, but not for work , so they selected a nice brown toned frame that looked more professional, so Jenny bought 2 new pair of glasses.
That night the new glasses were the center of attraction. Jenny was happy with her choices and asked Kim which pair she liked best.Kim went over to Jenny and put the bold plastic frames on her face and then gave her a great big kiss.Jenny was shocked at first but than put an arm around Kim s neck and kissed her back.
Kim apologized to Jenny, those glasses make you look so hot I had to kiss you . 
Jenny said I loved it , come here I want to give you another on , you look so hot wearing glasses, you turn me on. I wanted to do it before but did not have the nerve.
This was the start of a happy relationship. Having to wear glasses was turning out the best thing for both of them.
