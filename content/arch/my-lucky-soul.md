My lucky soul




Growing up as the youngest child in a family, makes you look up at the older ones, and notice a lot of things you like, and some you don't like..
I love my mother, I think she is beautiful, I love the way she looks at me, her mice blue eyes behind the lenses of her glasses.
I think glasses look so nice, my mom, dad, and both my sisters wear glasses, they all look so nice, 
I always wonder when I am going to get my glasses?. 


Why, don't I need to wear glasses now? 
Another eye exam, the same results, no glasses for me, and I don't know why? 
I think, I have been trying hard enough, I went to my sisters room, and found a pair of glasses, and took them to my room.
I like wearing them, I like the feel of the glasses on my face, when I am wearing my sisters old glasses, and I have been doing that for at least a year now, and love it, now, at last ,I can see perfectly when, wearing the glasses
I have 2 older sisters, they both wear glasses for myopia, and Kim who is the oldest wears, a -5.00 prescription, and Sandy is over -3.00 now, both my sisters started to wear glasses when in grade 3.
I am now in my second year of high school, how come I don't need to wear glasses, why does my vision not change, so I need to wear glasses.
At our last eye exams both my sisters were prescribed, an increase in their prescription, and are all excited, about getting their new glasses, 
Why do more girls, wear glasses then boys, with all that beautiful hair and figure, why do they have to have everything, perhaps I should have been a girl.
I give my soul, to be wearing myopic glasses! 


I know, that when I go to get my beginners drivers license, in a few weeks, I can't fake the test, because I had an eye exam, less than a month ago and my mother knows I don't need glasses.


Physics is one of my favourite subjects, and I am a good student, I have studied lenses, and spend a lot of time, getting all there is to know, about vision and glasses, when using the computer. 
I want to wear, high prescription myopic glasses, that is my dream, I have a real glasses fetish. 


To day another girl in my class, came to school wearing glasses for myopia, she looks fantastic, I will to have to make sure, to ask her for a date, Megan is my type of perfect girl.
On the way home on my bike, all I could think of, was Megan wearing glasses, and then all of a sudden, BOOM!!!!, I got hit by a car, and I can't remember anything else, my SOUL left me, to become an other human, and I was dead.


---------------------------


Peter's soul had to go and find a human egg, that was ready, to make a baby, to start a new life, and it soon found one.
----------------------------


Lisa and her husband Jim, have been married for about 5 years now, and have bee trying to have a family.
Lisa is an athletic, well build woman, with a beautiful head of hair, a great personality, and has a beautiful face, and she wears glasses for myopia, with about a -15.00 prescription.
Her husband Jim, a former college football player, is an optometrist, and the owner of an optical business.
Jim is a handsome glasses wearing man, who is myopic like his wife, and likes wearing his - 6.00 glasses.


To day Jim, is coming home from work early, I want him to be in a good, loving mood, because I am ovulating, and I want to become pregnant.
I will serve Jim some of his favourite treats, also wear my special going out glasses, that he likes so much, and I am sure, that will do it.
As I had expected, it was not long after Jim came home, we were in bed, having a wonderful time trying to make a baby.
--------------------
What I did not know, that there was that a soul, ready to make a new life.
--------------------
Our timing must have been right, because 6 weeks later the doctor told me I was definitely pregnant, we were all excited, was it going to be a boy or a girl?
Would it be wearing glasses like the parents, what will he or she going to look like, me or my husband, there are so many questions, we are so excited. and getting a room ready for our baby.
My husband is very happy, and we are even talking about names that we like for either a boy or girl.


The pregnancy went well, and I gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl, and we named her Emma.
Emma grew up fast, we think she is a bright girl, and we sure enjoyed playing with her. and see her growing up, to be a beautiful little girl, with a head of dark blond curly hair, and big blue eyes..
Our doctor suggested, we should get Emma's eyes examined, when she is about 4, because she has myopic parents, and she might be myopic, at an early age.
But that did not happen, Emma vision was perfect and had healthy eyes., my husband checked her vision every 6 months
Emma loved to go to daddy's store, she likes to try all the glasses, mom and dad are wearing glasses, why did she not wear glasses?,.
When she got older, kept asking her parents why she could not wear glasses, like they did, she wanted to wear glasses.
To satisfy Emma, her dad made up a pair of glasses with plain lenses, but Emma did not like them, she wanted, the real type of lenses, like other people.
On her 5th birthday, her dad told Emma, when after she had another eye exam, that she she could come to the store with mommy, and get herself a pair of real glasses. 
Daddy that is the best present, you can give me..
Emma could not wait to get to Daddy's store, to get her glasses.
It took Emma a long time to decide which frame she liked best, a brown or a blue one.
Her mom told her, that she can have both frames. 
Emma insisted, she go to the optician, to take the information, like she did with all the other patients
Because of the eye exam Emma had recently, she now is myopic, the optician looked at the prescription, she took the P.D., and wrote in the -0.75, prescription, Emma should now be satisfied, that she will have real prescription glasses.
Emma, was a very happy girl with her new glasses, and she wore them, very proudly all day long, and told us how much better she can see now.
We both loved her glasses wearing look, she looked so cute, and grown up, and we could not be happier, the way she liked wearing her glasses.


When Emma went to school in grade one, her prescription was -1.50, she feels very important, because she is wearing glasses, only2 other kids in her class wear glasses.
That changed when she went into grade 4, a lot more of the students were wearing glasses, but she had the highest prescription, and was very proud of that, it made her feel very confident.


By the time she went to high school, after growing to be a tall beautiful young woman, Emma is now wearing -7.50 glasses.
Her studies in high school went well, she is always very active in participating, with various clubs , and has a lot of dates.
She wants to be an optometrist, to work with her dad, at his practise, she works there now part time, and is very good assisting customers, with selecting frames for their new glasses, and loves her job.
Emma's prescription went up a little each year, she loves the look of her stronger lenses, and keeps on telling me, she wants her lenses to look like her mothers, she loves that look.


---------------------------------------


I need that information, so I decided, I go to the library and see if I can find it,.
Finding, what I was looking for, and going toward the exit, my eye spotted a beautiful head of hair on a girl, I want to have a closer look.
From where I sat looking at her, she seemed to have everything, except she wore glasses, well I would talk her into wearing contact lenses, I like to meet her.


-------------------------------------


To night when checking some information, on the library computer and from a few books, I noticed, a very handsome guy looking at me.
I cannot remember seeing him before, and I wonder how to meet him.
Then I remembered the old trick of dropping a book, and it worked, he was right there, picking it up for me.
Well thank you, I am Emma, a final year optometry student.
Glad to meet you Emma, I am Charles, but go by the name of Chuck, a last year engineering student.
when you are finished here, can I buy you some refreshments?
Yes, that will be nice Chuck, I am just about finished.


When sitting in the cafeteria, I noticed Chuck's eyes blinking, and being uncomfortable.
Realizing, he might have a problem with contact lenses, I asked him about it.
Yes, I have, I am wearing 30 day contacts, and lost my replacement lenses, and have to wait till I get new ones, when I get home.
Don't you have glasses, you can wear?
No, I don't like the way I look wearing glasses, and I don't have a pair.
Well it is still 6 weeks till the end of the year, I suggest, you come to the eye clinic, where, after one of the students, and the professor test you eyes, they will get you new glasses, if you don't you might cause permanent damage to your eyes, wearing old contact lenses.

Chuck, came to the school of optometry, for his eye exam, 
The student on secretary duties, made him fill out the proper forms, and the next student did the
pre exam, like any eye exam, and then another student did the complete eye eye exam, with the professor, who told Chuck not to wear contacts for at least a year. 
When finished he took his prescription to the student, who performed the optician duties.
to his surprise, Emma took his prescription.
O.D +3.50 ,and O.S + 3.75, and some astigmatism, 
Chuck, let's have a look for a frame.
It did not take long to find a frame, that Chuck liked. and after I took some measurements, told him the glasses should be ready in about an hour.
I could not wait to see Chuck wear his new glasses, but I would have to wait till later, as our duties rotated with each patient.
When Chuck came to pick up his glasses, was disappointed when Emma did not look after him, but the male student who did, congratulated him, you look very studious, and could not have chosen a nicer looking frame.
For the first time in his life, he liked his glasses look, and could not wait to see Emma again, to thank her, where to find her?


The best place to try to find Chuck, might be the library, and as luck would nave it. Chuck was there patiently waiting.
Wow! he looked handsome wearing glasses, and with the prescription he was wearing, his big brown eyes, looked so nice, I love this guy.
I gave him a hug, and told him how fantastic he looked.
He agreed, this is the first time since I started to wear glasses, that I like the way I look
We became a couple, and we met his and my parents, and we are going to get married, after graduation.
I am so happy, I sure have a LUCKY SOUL.
