description: My name is Goldilocks and this is my story of resilience, sacrifice, and discovering a new world through glasses.
---
My name is Goldilocks and this is my story.

When I was 16 my father left my mother,he had found another woman.

After 6 months my mother said I had to go and live with my grandmother.
She explained that she could not afford to feed all of us now.
In return for my food I had to help granny.

I did all the cleaning for granny every day and then I spent all the evenings studying by candlelight.

Granny saw me squinting at my books so she brought me an extra candle, it helped a little.

The next night granny brought me the second candle again and handed me her old reading glasses and suggested I wear them for studying.

They did make the print look bigger and blacker,but I had to hold the books much closer and when I looked up everything a few feet away was completely blurred.

Because I was using two candles each night to do my studying we were running out of them.so granny sent me shopping to buy more. Then she suggested I go and get my eyes tested while I was in town.

I was very nervous when I got into town, I bought the candles first then started looking for an opticians shop,there seemed to be 3 company's selling glasses,I was rather nervous,so I chose this small shop, it looked more friendly and less intimidating and the sign in the window said free eye tests.

The lady at the desk took all my details, then she showed me into the tiny backroom where a gentleman greated me.

I explained that it was difficult to see to do my studies ,and granny had given me her old reading glasses. They did make the print look bigger but I had to hold the books very close to read them.
He put a pair of funny glasses on me.then he put a black lens In front of my left eye and kept changing the lens for my right eye.I was amazed how many more small letter I could read each time he put a different lens in,then I had to tell him were the red dot was. After that he gave me a card to read. It was wonderful the words were so clear.
After he had done the same with my left eye he opened the door and told me to walk around the shop, I was so surprised what I could see, I never knew people could see like this.

We went back into the small room, when he took the funny glasses off of me I panicked,everything was so blurred now.

He explained that I was very short sighted and had a bad astigmatism, and I needed to wear glasses all the time now.

He gave me a form to sign. It was difficult to see the writing on it now.Then I had to take it to the lady and she would take some measurement and help me choose glasses.

I told the lady that I would have to come back another day as I didn't have any money for glasses.

She explained that because I was studying I could have a pair free, the government would pay and if I went back in an hour they would be ready for me.

An hour later I excitedly watched as she opened the case.

My excitement changed to shock,they were nothing like granny's reading glasses,

They were small and round. The thick glass lenses protruded from the back of the black metal frame.

The lady hooked the spring cables over the back of my ears,everything suddenly seemed to jump at me.
As I walked around the shop the floor seemed to move towards me.The lady explained that it would take me a few days to get used to the powerful lens, it was unusual for such a young person to need these high power lens for their first pair of glasses,and I must wear them all the time.

She then handed me the piece of paper I had signed and asked me to read it

When I signed it everything on it was a blur,but now I could read even the smallest print,I asked her what all the numbers meant.
R-4.75 - 3.25 170
L -3.25 -2.50  90.

She explained that I was very shortsighted and had a high astigmatism,that's why I was getting such bad headaches when I was studying.

When I looked in the mirror I had mixed feelings,I could certainly see everything clearer.but the black metal glasses dominated my face,they contrasted so much against my pale skin and blonde hair.
My eyes looked very different pearling through the thick lens.

My grandmother was very pleased to see me and said I looked very pretty wearing my new glasses.
That Was very kind of her.as I felt ugly wearing them.
I think she was more pleased that the candles would last longer now haha.

Within a few days I was totally dependent on them.and gradually got used to seeing myself wearing them.

The next year seemed to go so fast, I was happy living with granny,my studies were going very well. Then one day she asked me to do the shopping for her as she felt rather tired 

I thought I would take a shortcut through the woods as it looked as if it might rain, in my rush I tripped over a tree root that was sticking up in the path, as I hit the ground my glasses flew off.
This was the first time I had been outside without my glasses since I got them a year ago.i felt almost blind without them, My hands thumbled around as I tried to find my glasses,
To my horror as my fingers grasped the frame I felt a crack across the right lens then I realised the left lens was missing.

It was difficult to see with just the one cracked lens but I managed to get to the town, but I could not see well enough to find the nice opticians.
I asked a lady if she could direct me there.

She said sadly they had closed because the premises were too small,but there was a nice new opticians that had open just around the corner it was privately run and not one of those big multiple companies

I blindly opened the door and a familiar voice greated me.

The lady explained that she recognised me from when I got my first pair of glasses at the small opticians 
When the owner of this glasses shop bought all the stock and record from his brother she came to work here.
 
I explained what had just happened

The eye Doctor looked at my record card,and suggested we retest my eyes today.

First he shone this bright light in my eyes, then he put the test frames on me and covered my left eye with the black lens.
Then before adding any lens for my right eye he asked me what letters I could read.

I went rather red when I had to admit I couldn't read any of them.

“Don't worry miss let's see what you can read with these lens,they are the same as in the glasses you have just broken”

I managed the Big E and I think I got a few on the next line correct.

“There seems to have been rather a large change in your eye sight,but don't worry we can soon sort that”

The test seemed to take much longer this time,I lost count of how many different lens he tried

He then gave me a card to read,at first I found it difficult to read the letter but after he had changed the lens a few times I could read all the lines.

“I expect you realise that there has been rather a large change in your eyesight,Are you still doing a lot of studying 

I explained that I was a little behind with my studies as I kept getting lots of headaches

He smiled at me.”I am going to prescribe a second pair of glasses for when you are reading, that should stop the headaches”

“This is your new prescription for normal use”

“R -10.75  -4.25  175  prism out 8
“L  -6 .25  -3,25.   95  prism out 2

“For your reading glasses”

“R -8.75  -4.25 175 Prism out 10 up 2 
“L - 4.25  -3,25   95 Prism out  4 up 1.50 

He showed me into a waiting room and said I could stay there while they made my 2 pairs of glasses,

The Lady brought me coffee and biscuits 

I guested my new lens would be thicker,but I had not prepared myself for what I saw when she opened the first case.

The frames were a little larger but still the same round metal style,but this time in a dark brown tortoiseshell colour.The lens were flat at the front but even thicker at the edges than before and seemed to be scooped out at the back,they still had the cable hook to go over my ears,  

As the lady placed them on my face and hooked the cables behind my ears, I could feel the extra weight on my nose.

Everything was very sharp, but I felt my eyes being pulled sideways then the lady gave me the card to read. I found it impossible to read any of it ,she then opened the case with my reading glasses in, the lens looked very strange, they seemed to have lots of Lines on them.

It was wonderful to be able to read the print so easy, but my eyes seemed not only to be pulled sideways but also up.

They lady gave me back my new tortoiseshell glasses to put on.

As I was leaving the lady said the doctor wanted to see me again in 6 months.

It was very strange walking in my new glasses, especially through the woods.

My grandmother was shocked to see me wearing new glasses with even thicker lenses and didn't understand why I needed different glasses for reading.

For the last 6 months I have had to to do much more to help granny ,since she had her fall, so I was studying late into the night,I was  getting headaches again and having problems keeping my eyes straight when I was studying,I then 
remembered I had been told to go back to the eye doctor after 6 month 

I won't bore you with all the details but I saw the same Doctor. He understood whyI was getting such bad headaches again, and said he would give me an even stronger prescription to help with the headaches and increase the prisms prevent my eyes from wandering. 

The lady opened the case with my new glasses in,they looked strange. You couldn't see the silver frame, just these 2 thick round lumps of glass,when I looked in the mirror my face looked all shrunken and I could feel my eyes being pulled in and up..

The lady then gave me my prescription to read,it was impossible to read any of it until I put my new reading glasses on, I started to cry as I read the numbers out.

Distance 
R -14,50. -5.25 180 prism out 14 up 6
L - 8.25.  - 4.25 100 prism out.10  up 4 

Reading 
R-10.50 -5.25 180  prism out 18 up 8
L -6.25. -4.25. 100  prism out 12 up 6

I was very strange walking home with my new glasses, my eyes felt they were being pulled outward and up to the sky's 


I have now finished my studies and granny said it was time to find work in the big city 

I walked through the woods for the last time and caught the bus to the city.

After I had found a small apartment to rent,it was time to earn money.

I did not know what sort of work to find,my eyesight is so poor now I don't know who will want to employ me.

I had a few interviews, but when people saw me having to keep changing my glasses to read, they politely said I was not suitable.

I was feeling very sad as I started to think maybe I look to see if any shops wanted a sales lady 
Sadly most of the adverts in the Windows wanted experienced sales lady's.

Then I spotted this big sign in a window.

SALES LADY REQUIRED NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED 
A GLASSES WEARER PREFERRED.

I squinted to see what sort of shop it was, to my surprise It was a large glasses shop. I was very scared to go in.

I nervously opened the door,and a friendly voice greeted me,I squinted hard to see the lady,as she got closer to me I realised it was the same lady that had worked into the other shops 

She explained it was owned by the son of the gentleman who ran the little glasses shop I first went to.
And she would speak to the owner on my behalf.

I had to wait until he was free. But then he greeted me and showed me into his office.
He asked me lots of questions, then gave me a form and asked me to fill it in.

I apologised that I would need to put my reading glasses on to see the form

He said that was fine.

“When did you last have your eyes test miss”

I said about 2 years ago,  “but I am having problems seeing again, will that stop me getting the job”

I Nervously opened my reading glasses case and put them on, while I was filling the form he asked the receptionist to ring his uncle and get my records.

When I handed him the form,he said what nice handwriting I had. 

I went bright red when he said,.

”I think it's time we tested your eyes,then I can answer your questions”

He pointed to this big black chair.

“You can keep your glasses on for now”

Then he held this black paddle In front of my left eye and asked me to read the letters, I started to shake.

“I'm sorry I can't read any of them”

“There is nothing to say sorry about Goldilocks”

Then like the other doctors he put the eye test frames on me and started adding more and more different lens, then after what seemed like hours I managed to read 4 lines  with each eye

Next he Handed me a card to hold, I knew I wouldn't be able to read any until he changed the lens 

I felt myself shaking as he slowly hooked the cables of my glasses back over my ears.

“Thank you for your time Doctor, I know my eyesight is to bad to get the job”

 I started to get up.

“What made you think that Goldilocks.

“Well I have to keep changing my glasses to see to read and that takes time, and I'm sure you my next glasses are going to look even uglier”

“Well I suggest we get you fitted with some different glasses and you start tomorrow for a months trial”

I could not believe what I was hearing.

“We have a lot of girls that should wear glasses but are too shy to wear them. Seeing a pretty girl like you wearing glasses,it will give them confidence to wear theirs”

“Do you have money to buy a new dress and some make up”

I looked down and said “no”

“Ok I will give you an advance on your first weeks wages, you go and ask the lady what sort of dress to buy then come back at 5 pm and I will have your new glasses ready”

He handed me a piece of paper to sign,

He pointed to a place on the form and I blindly signed it,I was too Embarrassed to put my reading glasses on again.

I had never been to a coffee shop, but I was shaking so much I needed to sit down,

After I had drunk some of my coffee I was calmer now.I had never worn my old reading glasses outside before,I felt everybody was looking at me as I put them on on.There were so many numbers on the form this time.

Distance glasses 
R-22.75  -5.75  130 prism out 18 up 8
L.16.75. -5,25. 170 prism out 12 up 6

A large deterioration of sight in the left eye.

Franklin bifocals for receptions work  Add 4 

Reading  glasses ADD 5 increase prisms by 5

My heart sunk.

At 5pm I was sitting in the reception room waiting for the lady to fit my new glasses.But to my surprise the Doctor came out holding 3 cases

“This is your distance glasses goldilocks.They have a new type of lens,they are called Myodisc lenses”

“They have a flat front and 2 small 22mm circulars lens ground into them, this makes them thinner and lighter”

“I have fitted them into a nice gold metal frame for you”

He came close to me and gently took my glasses off and placed the new glasses on my nose and hooked the cables over my ears.

It seemed strange looking through the 2 little circles,everything in front of me was so clear and the glasses so much lighter than before.

He explained that I would get used to having to move my head sideways more.

When I looked in the mirror it was strange seeing my tiny eyes looking through the 2 little circles, but he said I looked very pretty 

My reading glasses were very small black metal frames with a 30mm wide lens which was nearly the same thickness.

The biggest surprise was yet to come.

“These are the newest style we have,they are pale pink plastic frame”

I still had my new reading glasses on so I held the new bifocals close to me to look at them, they were different to anything I had ever seen before.

He explained that they weren't broken, but had 2 lenses joined together, so if I looked through the top lens I would be able to see everything in the distance and if I looked down I could see to read, so I wouldn't have to change glass at work.

The frames were a lovely pale pink colour and much bigger than I had ever worn before.

As he removed my reading glasses he faded into a blur, then he hooked the metal cables of my bifocals over my ears. I could feel the warmth of his breath ,then he told me to look up, suddenly my heart was pounding as I could see every detail of his face.

I kept looking up and down. It was wonderful not having to change glasses to be able to read, the only problem was the exstream weight of the glass lens.
As I looked sideways in the mirror I could see why they We're so heavy the lenses were the thickest I have ever had,They must have been over 50 mm thick but I didn't mind as I had a job and the doctor was smiling at me.


   
My month's trial is finishing today. The Doctor has told me that he wants to talk to me after work.

I have enjoyed myself working here and I will be sad to leave.

The last 2 weeks I have been helping on the reception desk,My bifocals have been very helpful. I have still only worn them for work because they are extremely heavy,
Also it has taken a while to get used to my Myodisc lens,only being able to see through the 22mm circles has been difficult,as it means I have no peripheral vision,which is rather like looking through a tunnel.but they are much lighter weight.

I started to shake as the doctor invited me through to his appartment.

“Well Goldilocks have you enjoyed working here for the last month”

I went red and nodded. 

“How was it working on the reception”

“I loved it sir, my bifocals helped me a lot,I only made a couple of mistakes, that was when I misheard the customers names I'm sorry about that.

“Don't worry about that it's easily sorted”

“How would you feel about being our full time receptionist”

“You mean you want me to stay even though I made a few mistakes”

“Yes  that's easily sorted”

“What is that big white button and the box sir”

“It's the latest hearing aid Godilocks, sit still while I fit this in your right ear”

The white button seemed to have a plastic nipple on the back of it,I felt my heart racing as he pushed the nipple part deeper and deeper into my ear.

“Now Put this cord around your neck Goldilocks and attached the box to it”
“That's good now I will put the plug into the box and turn it on”

“OOOOOO SIR  WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING AT ME EVERYTHING IS SO LOUD.IM SCARED”

“Please sir I need the toilet PLEASE”

I rushed to the lady's room, why was my pee all sticky and my breasts felt strange.

I got back and sat down.

“I'm sorry sir I was shocked  how loud everything was, my voice sounds so ldifferent ,Am I shouting now .

“It fine Goldilocks it will take you a few days to get used to it”

“Do you want me wear this when I'm on the reception”

“I think it's better if you wore it all the time just like your glasses”

“Now that you are my new receptionist,I suggest you put your coat on and let's go out for a meal to celebrate”

“No. Don't change your glasses Goldilocks,your bifocals look nice and you will see the menu better”

“What about my hearing aid sir shall I take it out”

“No of course not Goldilocks, it's look fine,you need to wear it always now”

I felt nervous as I walked outside for the first time wearing my bifocals and this large white hearing aid button in my ear

The meal was wonderful,it was so nice he sat on my right side I often saw him looking at my hearing aid and the thick right lens that protruded from the back of the pink frame 
He smiled as I looked up and down while eating by food, I did not notice the  bifocal line across the lens now.

He laughed as my hearing aid whistled when he gave me a kiss. 
My pantys felt all warm.

Sad it's only a fairy story .
