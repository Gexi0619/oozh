You should not be wearing contact lenses?


These days, I seem to get more story ideas, by just reading, some of the news.




Amy and I are twin sisters, we are almost 16, yeas old.
Yes, we think, we are good looking, we are a nice height, with a well developed bust line, nice long, dark blond hair, we have a nice skin tone, and facial features, and of course our nice, big blue eyes.
We both, are myopic, and wear glasses, at least, I do, Amy wears her contact lenses, all the time, she hates wearing glasses.
I like, wearing up to date frames, I have always liked wearing glasses, I feel good wearing glasses, and like my glasses wearing look, I certainly would not want to be without them.
We started to wear our glasses, in grade 4, when I told my mother, that I was having trouble, to see, what the teacher wrote on the black board.
Amy, refused to admit, that she had the same trouble, but I knew she did, she sure did not want to wear glasses.
My mother, was the boss, and told Amy, that we both get our yearly eye exam, and if you have to wear glasses, you wear them.


On the day, of the exam, Amy, was not in a good mood, she knew, that she needed glasses, and she sure did not want them.
I was ready for the exam, I was looking forward to getting glasses, after trying my class mate Judy's glasses, I had realized, that when wearing glasses, it certainly, would improve my eye sight, and have almost perfect vision.
As expected, we were prescribed to wear glasses, full time, because our prescription was, in the - 1.00. to - 1,50 range.
Amy,, asked about contact lenses, but the optometrist, suggested, she wait, till after the next exam, in about 6 months, to check and see, if our prescription needed an increase.
Sure enough, at our next eye exam, we both had a 1/2 diopter increase in our prescription. 
Amy is happy now, she can wear contact lenses, I tried them, but I prefer to wear glasses.
Of course growing up, our eye glasses prescription, grew to. and now that we are
in our second second year of high school, the prescription of our glasses has increased to the minus 4 level, and mine is about 3/4 diopters higher then Amy's prescription.
I love, the looks of my new glasses, the lenses show some rings, and I think my eyes look even nicer, behind the lenses.
Amy, who wears her contact lenses, all the time, has been warned, to give her eyes a rest, once and a while, and wear her glasses.
The past two eye exams, Amy, could not even been bothered, getting spare glasses, in the same prescription, 
I told her, you are going to be sorry, not getting, a pair of glasses, with the same prescription, you never know, when, there is an occasion, that you might need to wear glasses.


Amy told me, she is sure, that guys, do not like girls who wear glasses.
I have no trouble getting dates, so there must be a number of guys, who either like the looks of a girl who wears glasses, or look beyond the glasses, and see the girl the way she is, a nice personality, and a smile, always help.


So life went on, , until we hit, the big bump in the road, the corona virus.
My mother, who, before she got married was a registered nurse, made sure, we had the medical supplies, that we might need, in our house.


After all the schools were closed, it sure changed our lives, and we did not like it, that we had to stay home.
We could not even, have our friends over for a visit, so we texted and phoned,
to stay in touch, to be up to date, on all the news, in the neighbourhood. 


About two weeks later, we heard, that a few people, in the neighbourhood, are now sick with the virus.
We are very careful, to do everything, we are suppose to do, and follow all the rules and regulations. 
We only go out, when we need to go shopping, to a grocery or drugstore, and then we make sure, we wear a mask.


Amy, is far more concerned then I am, about catching the bug, but the funny part is, she hates staying home, and she goes out, with her mask on, when ever she can, wearing, the mask, makes her feel safe.
Being my twin sister, I just wonder, why with some things, she is so different then I am.
I like wearing glasses, she hates them, I like to get new glasses, in the latest styles, she, only wants to wear, contact lenses, and won't get a pair of glasses, for when something happens, and she needs to wear glasses.


To day, I was reading an article, by some experts, from the American Academy of Optometry.
There seems to be, some difference of opinion, about, wearing either glasses, or contacts, during the pandamic.
Some experts feel, that wearing glasses is safer than, wearing contact lenses,
the reason being, that while wearing contact lenses, your eyes, are exposed to the virus, and you might rub your eyes.
When you wearing glasses, they shield your eyes, to some extent, and with the larger modern, frame, are more like a mask, for your eyes.
Another study found, that if somebody sneezes, and does not do anything about it, the droplets, can go as far as 10 to 12 feet.
I found this, very interesting, an intend to mention it, to Amy.
After, I mentioned , all this information to Amy, she got all upset, now she is scared, to even going out, while wearing her contacts, and she does not have any glasses, in her present prescription, what is she going to do?
Well, I think, I might be able to help you.
My prescription, has always been, a little higher, than yours, perhaps you are comfortable, wearing my last pair, why don't you give it a try, I will go and get them for you.
After, Amy tried my glasses, told me, these glasses, give me as good a vision, as I have, wearing my contacts., can I have them?
Sure, if you can use them, by all means.
So know, Amy is wearing glasses full time, and does not complain at all, about wearing glasses, we cannot believe it.. 


All, good and bad things, come to an end, sooner or later.
At last, we should be safe to go out, without a mask, because, there is now, a vaccine, that we all, have received, and everything should be getting back, to normal soon.
Amy, is still wearing my old glasses, and told me, that as soon as the optical store is open, she is going to get, a new up to date frame, in her present prescription.
She now is, so used to wearing glasses, and likes the new styles, that now she has no desire to go back to contact lenses.


When Amy, had a date with her boyfriend again, he complimented her, on how nice she looked wearing glasses, and he likes it, to see her wearing glasses.
