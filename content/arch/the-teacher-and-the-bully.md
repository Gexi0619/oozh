description: Nicole, a soon-to-be teacher, discovers the power of glasses as she helps a student with vision problems.
---
Nicole was in her last year of university, studying to become a teacher.
She was looking forward to the end of the semester and graduation, so she would be able to start teaching and generate some income.
Being born and raised on a farm she liked the quiet rural life.
She had been very active in 4 H , and school activities.
She and her younger sister helped their mother with the work around the house.
Her two older brothers helped their Dad.

Because her mother wore glasses, and was very aware of eye health, it was a yearly routine for everybody to have an eye exam 
just before the new school year started.
When Nicole was going into grade 6, she was prescribed glasses. She certainly had not expected that.
She was myopic, her prescription was -1.25 for the right and -1.00 for the left eye.
She was not very happy to be the only one in the family beside her mother to have to wear glasses.
After she started wearing them, she found they were very comfortable to wear and with the big improvement in her vision, was happy to have them.
She of course wanted to know more about eyes and vision, and used her computer and found out about lenses myopia astigmatism 
hyperopia, and the different signs of showing probable vision problems.
With all this information , she started to notice students who were squinting, or tried to sit in the front of the class to be able to see , and those who complained about head aches.

Time went fast , Nicole was in her last year of high school , when her prescription increased to -2.50  in the right and -2.25 in the left eye./
She did not mind she could see well and was comfortable wearing glasses.
After their last eye exam her sister was prescribed glasses, it seemed both girls took after their mother.

Nicole was now a 4 H leader. She really enjoyed helping the younger girls to learn how to bake, sow  and other activities.
She liked the teaching part , it was very satisfying.
At one of their 4 h meetings , when Nicole was showing some slides, Kathy one of the girls came over to her , she was upset she could not see the pictures very clear.
Realizing Kathy s problem,might be , she told her to wait a minute.
Nicole went to her bedroom and found her first pair of glasses, she handed them to Kathy , try theses glasses they might help you 
see the pictures better.
When Kathy put the glasses on and looked at the pictures was all smiles and told Nicole she could see the pictures just fine now.
When the meeting was finished and the parents came to pick up the girls to take them home, Nicole mentioned to Kathy s mother what had happened . Kathy s mother was very surprised her daughter had not complained about her vision and thanked Nicole and told her she would discuss it with her husband.
At their next 4 H meeting , Kathy was wearing glasses and thanked Nicole for her help, she liked her glasses.

After graduating it did not take Nicole long to secure a teaching position.
When she went to the school to become familiar with her new surroundings , and to meet the teachers and staff.
The principal informed her she would be teaching grade 5.
Miss Brown the grade 4 teacher told her she was getting a nice group of students. Nicole was happy about that.

When school started and the students started to enter the class room , Nicole greeted each student , asked for thei name , and told them to take a seat.
There were 25 students in her class , 13 girls and 12 boys.
When everybody was seated , she was surprised to notice that there were quite a few seats left in the back row, and some of the bigger boys sitting close to the front.
The first day went well.
