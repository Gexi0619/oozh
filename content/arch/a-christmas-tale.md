X Mas tale

The house with  the Christmas lights, is where I live.
Last weekend Mom, Dad , my younger brother Jeff and I did the decorating, it was lots of fun to get into the Christmas spirit. 
My name is Carolyn, I am  11 yrs old, and I am looking forward to the hollidays.

At school I am in grade 5 , 


One of my girl friends  is Kelley , a cute brunette , we have been friends since grade 1.
Lately her school work has not been very good , I am surprised she has always been a very good student.
When we were having lunch to day she sat with me., and I noticed she had been crying.
 I asked her if there was something I could help her with.Please tell me.
Kelley told me that her schoolwork was not very good , and she thinks ,she now  knows why.
So she told me that Patricia , one of our class mates had come to school wearing glasses.
She let me try her glasses  , and when I wore them I could see everything  so nice and clear  , I could not believe it , I think I need glasses.
So what , I said  lots of people wear them.
Oh that is not the problem ,I think glasses are expensive .
I know  my parents cannot afford to buy me glasses.
You know last year my dad got hurt in an accident , and the monthly allowance  he gets is not very big.
My mother can only work partime at night when I am home to look after Dad , and my younger brother.
  I know there is no money to spare for glasses , mom has  even trouble to  pay the mortage on the house.
I told her perhaps there is a solution  , I will try to find out.

That night at home I counted the money I had saved for Christmas presents, I knew I would have some to spare.
Whem I looked on my computer, to find out about glasses  I noticed that you could buy glasses for as little as $ 10.00.
I could afford that,I could buy Kelley a pair of glasses.
When I checked the website , I realized  that  you would need a prescription.
 Now I had to find out how to get a prescription.
On the way home from school , we always passed an optical store , I would go in , the next day after school  and ask them  how to get an prescription..

I have never been in an optical store so was a little hesitant.
I slowly opened the door of the optical store , and went in.
A nice lady greeted me and asked if she could help me.
I told her that I needed an eyeglasses prescription for a friend of mine who needed glasses.
If you can give me a prescription , than I can buy the glasses on line for her , they cost $10.00 and I have the money.
The lady smiled , told me to have  look around , she would be right back.
I looked around , all those glasses, there must be a lot of people who need to wear glasses.

The lady came back with an elderly gentleman.
I told him the whole story how she realized she needed to wear glasses , and  why  her mother could not afford to buy her glasses, but that I have  $ 10. 00 and will buy them for her.
He said I am glad you came in, we can  get you a prescription for her glasses.
What you have to do is bring your friend in , and have her mother give her,  her  own health card, then the govenement pays for the eye exam , and we can get her  a complete prescription.
Bring your friend in to morrow this time  after school ,  I will  have time  to examine her eyes and get you a prescription.
I thanked the gentleman and told him we would  back to morrow after school.
I ran to Kelley s place and told her everything the nice man at the optical store  had told me.
She was all excited and told me she will  ask her mother for her health card.

The next day at school Kelley told me her mother  had  given  her  the health card so she could go for the eye examination.
After school the two of us went to the optical shop, and Kelley had her eye exam.
The optometrist could not believe how Kelley had not complained about her vision before.
Her prescription read -2.00 on the right and â€“ 1.75 on the left eye, she was lucky she did not have noticeable astigmatism.
When the optometrist was finished ,he  came to tell me that Kelley sure needed to wear glasses.
When I asked him for the prescription he suggested he would  order the glasses .
He suggested  Kelley  select a frame she liked ,so he  would know what to order.
We had fun selecting a frame , and found one she really liked.
The optometrist told me he would let me know when the glasses were ready  .
On the way home Kelley told me all about the eye exam .

About a week later the gentleman from the  optical shop had left  a message at my house ,that Kelley s glasses were ready.
My mother asked me what that was all  about it, so I told her the whole  story, that I was buying Kelly new glasses for $ 10.00. and they were ready to be picked up.

The next day after school Kelley and I went to pick up her glasses.
When she put them on and looked around , all she said was , I can t believe   how well I can see everything so clear , I can t believe it.
I paid the optometrist the $ 10.00  and thanked him for ordering the glasses for me.
Kelley came to me with tears in her eyes and thanked me , and gave me a big hug .
All I said was Merry Christmas , the glasses are your Christmas present ,I am glad you like them.
The optometrist had a big smile on his face , and  wished us both a very merry Christmas.

On the way home all Kelley did was telling me ,how she could see everything so nice and clear now, 
how happy she was ,and thanked me again and again.

When I came home my mother wanted to know how everything went.
I told her all about Kelley s new glasses and how happy she is with her improved vision.
My mother gave me a big hug and told me that  she was very proud of me and  that I had the right Christmas spirit.


I hope you like this story,
MERRY CHRISTMAS to all and a HAPPY NEW YEAR
