---
In a quiet neighborhood lives  the Brown family.
Mr. and Mrs Brown and their 5 yr old daughter Jennifer [ Jenny]
Jenny is a very lively pretty fair haired girl, she is very athletic and loves music.
When she was 6 years old Mrs. Brown signed Jenny up for dancing lessons
She really enjoyed the dancing lessons , she was a natural, and very graceful in her  movements.
Her teachers loved here she was a pleasure to teach.

Jenny loved going to school, liked her teacher and had lots of friends.
When Jenny was in third grade  she did not to well in her studies.
Jenny s mother who was myopic , noticed some signs that Jenny might have a vision problem,
and might need to wear glasses.
She made an appointment to have Jenny s eyes examined.
Jenny was very surprised, and asked her mother why she should have her eyes examined,
 I can see just fine.Her mother told her , that she was jenny s age when she had started to wear glasses.
I have noticed you squinting quite a bit , and want to make sure that you can see well.
Mom what is it like to wear glasses?
 Will they interfere with my dancing ?
Glasses are great. you can see everything well, and you don t even know you are wearing them.
You will be able to dance and do all sorts of things wearing glasses, I like wearing mine.
When they went for the eye exam, when it was finished the doctor told them that Jenny was myopic and had some astigmatism and was prescribed glasses.
Her prescription was -1.00 for the right and -1.25 for the left eye and the correction for astigmatism.
With her mother s help , Jenny selected a frame that she liked 
When the glasses were ready ,and Jenny put them on , could not believe how much better she could see everything , nice and clear., it was unbelievable.
With being able to see so much better, Jenny felt much better having to wear glasses.
She started to like of the look of herself wearing glasses, and did not mind having to wear them.
A lot of her friends told her how nice she looked wearing glasses.
At the next dancing lesson she realized her glasses improved her dancing, because she could see so much better now.

A few years later , in her third year at high school, and a few more eye exams, her prescription now was -3.25 for the right and -3.50 for the left eye and an increase in her astigmatism.
Jenny now liked wearing glasses, she liked her own look better with glasses than without , and loved the look of her new lenses.
Jenny now had grown into a tall beautiful women.
At the last dancing school annual performance Jenny was the star of the show.
Her performance was so good, that the teachers of the ballet school invited her to join their school.
Jenny after talking with her mother , accepted the invitation
She had learned tapp dancing , jazz , highland  dancing and also creative movements, and was looking forward to learn ballet .

A few years later , Jenny was working very hard to get ready for the ballet school annual Christmas show.
As there were not very many male students at the ballet school, only parts of the Nutcracker Suite 
were performed , and Jenny was chosen to do the dance of The Sugar Plum Fairy.
This was a solo performance and was going to be the highlight of the show.
Jenny worked very hard to do the dance to perfection.
She had heard the music so many times , that she knew it by heart, and even danced it in her sleep.
About a week before the show, which was a complete sell out,, Jenny was told that she could not wear her glasses during the show, ballerina s did not wear glasses , if she could not see well enough without her glasses, she should wear  contact lenses .
Jenny was devastated, and went home in tears.
Mom what am I going to do?
Well you are due for an eye exam shortly ,let us make an appointment and see what can be done.
They were able to get an appointment the next day.
After the eye exam, the optometrist told them that she could not wear contact lenses,
and with her prescription of -3.50 for the right and -3.75 for the left eye , should not walk around without glasses.

He suggested she get a frameles glasses , as they would not be very noticeable.
Jenny and her mother selected a frame that was almost invisible, and they agreed that they were the glasses she was going to wear, or no dance.
When Jenny got her new glasses noticed the increase in her prescription, liked the looks of her new lenses, but did not care much for the new skimpy frame, she felt naked.

A few days later at the dress rehearsal , Jenny wore her new glasses
She walked over to her teacher  and showed her the new glasses,and told her she was told to wear her glasses,or no dance.
The teacher looked at here glasses and said ballerinas never wear glasses , but with you  we have  no choice,
So Jenny was going to wear her new glasses when she did here solo dance.
On the night of the ballet school Christmas show in front of a sell out audience , the show went well.
Jenny was very excited when she went on stage, she was the last performer of the show/
When the music started , she danced as she had never danced before and when finished received a standing ovation. she was so happy,

In the next days daily paper , was a review of the show.
Jenny was complimented on her excellent performance, and it was noted that the lenses of her 
glasses created such a nice sparkle for a real fairy performance, and was a great idea.
The show was well presented , and all the dancers performed well and was a great success and the ballet school was complimented on presenting a great show.
The teachers of the ballet school were very pleased with the review in the paper and decided that a ballerina can wear glasses.
Jenny was smiling.
