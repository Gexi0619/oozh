I am glad he likes the looks of glasses.




I am Jessie, a second year student at our high school.
Being an only child, makes a good friend more important.
Amber, has been my friend since grade one., and we get along like sisters,
which is very important when you are growing up.


My looks, are very important to me, I am very proud of my nice, long blond hair.
I love my long hair, I can braid it ,wear it loose, or in a bun, or whatever style, I feel like.
With my, looks I hope to attract a boy, that I really like.


This summer, I had a nice temporary job, as receptionist at a nice business
I enjoyed the work and having my breaks, with other young women who worked there.
To day, Carol, one of the girls I usually have lunch with, came to work wearing glasses.
I could not believe how good she looked, wearing a nice coloured pair of glasses,
which blended so nice with her hair colour.
After complimenting her, on her good looks, she told me that she loves her new look..
Not being familiar with glasses, I asked her many questions, and had a chance to try the glasses.
I loved the feel of the glasses on my face, and looking in a mirror, liked how I looked wearing glasses.


The next time I got together with Amber, I told her about wearing Carol’s glasses.
Yes, glasses, are now becoming a real fashion accessory, and you see more people wearing glasses now.
I would not mind , wearing glasses, but I don’t need them.
I have regular eye exams, and no glasses for me.


I am now in my last year of high school.
Jim, one of our high school football players, has been dating me.
We really get along, and I love the guy, and are dating regularly.
Jim, after graduating from high school, is going to our local university to study engineering.
I have a job, at the business, where I had a summer job.




Life is always full of surprises, and I was so happy, when Jim gave me a friendship ring for my birthday.
We like to get married, but decided to wait, until Jim has graduated from university.


Feeling more secure with the ring on my finger, we now have sex, and try to be carefull, while enjoying it
But it is like they say, if you play with fire, you might get burned.
I think , I might be pregnant, I feel so different.
I talked to my mother, she calmly said, you have your choice, get married or give your child up for adoption.
When Jim and I discussed it, we decided to get married.
My parents told us, we could live in the upstairs of their house, which would save us some money till Jim graduated.




After we got married, I discovered, I had a false pregnancy, 
Jim and I, were not sorry we had married, we sure enjoyed our lifestyle.
Jim studied and I worked, and we saved some money.




At my work, I usually had lunch with Carol, I liked the girl and we always had lots of things, to talk about.
To day she asked me to come with her to the optical store, to pick up her new glasses.
When we got there, I looked and tried some of the frames on display, while the optician looked after Carol.
I can’t believe , how good I look wearing some of the frames, and I am kind of sorry, that I have perfect vision.
Carol looks great wearing her new glasses, I wish it was me, but how does Jim feel, about a wife who wears glasses?




Jim, studies often after classes, at the university library, so he has information readily available.
I usually spend the night watching T V , until Jim gets home.
Lately, Jim has mentioned that, some of the female students, look so nice wearing glasses.
I have also noticed Jim looking at every female wearing glasses. 
I wonder, if I am right and he prefers glasses wearing women.
The next day, at work, I mentioned it to Carol.
Yes Jenny, a lot of men now prefer the looks of a glasses wearing woman.
I would not mind wearing glasses, but I don’t need them.
Perhaps you can induce myopia, I have read it can be done, by wearing prescription glasses all the time.
And soon, you cannot function without wearing glasses.
I would like to try it, but I do not know how.
Jenny, tomorrow, I will bring my old glasses, and you can give it a try.




He next day, Carol handed me two glasses cases, containing her first two pairs of glasses.
When I tried the glasses, I had pretty good vision, wearing the first pair.
After trying the second pair, and looking around, decided that it should not take me long to see perfectly.
wearing the stronger glasses.
I wore the glasses as much as I could, but did not want Jim to see me wearing glasses, until I got my own prescription glasses.
Because, Jim spend a lot of nights studying, I had the opportunity, to wear the glasses almost all day..
I now like my vision better wearing glasses.


I went and had an eye exam, the optometrist told me I was slightly myopic and if I wanted I could wear glasses.
He gave me my prescription, which read, O.D -0.50, O.S 0.75,.
Well at least I am myopic now, how to get myopic enough to wear lenses,, that show some rings,
and make your eyes look a little smaller.
I decided to try contact lenses, and had a session on how to insert and remove the lenses.,
and was handed some lenses to practise.
Now I had some lenses to wear, and get used to wearing contact lenses,
I ordered some -3.00 , lenses, and started to wear them all day, hpoing that they would do the job, 
because I like to start wearing glasses, as soon as possible, knowing now, that Jim loves the looks of glasses.
I am so anxious to get my own stronger glasses to wear, so I can show Jim.


Wearing the -4.00 contact lenses gave me perfect vision, and I wore them all day.
When I was talking with Carol, I told her my vision was perfect now wearing the -4 lenses, she suggested,
I should order -4 glasses on line, then I have stronger glasses to wear.




How exciting it was, when I put on the glasses, I had ordered on line.
I loved the looks of the frame, and my vision was perfect, wearing my new glasses.
Now how to tell Jim, and show him my new glasses?
It was easier than I had expected, he phoned me to tellme he would be late for supper,
because he had to study for an exam.
I told him supper, and a big surprise could wait till he got home.




When Jim came home, and saw me wearing glasses, could not believe his eyes.
He told me I was the most beautiful woman on earth.
What I had not realized how big a turn on the glasses were for Jim, because before I knew,
I was in bed and we were having sex. 


I am so glad I am wearing glasses now, Jim loves me more than ever, and I love wearing glasses.
Jim never asked where I got the glasses, and has no idea, I forced my vision, so I could wear glasses
No, I am not sorry, everything is working out just fine, Jim is graduating, and has a good job,
and the biggest surprise, I am really pregnant now
All this happiness, because I started to wear glasses????
I am glad he likes the looks of glasses.
