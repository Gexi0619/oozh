description: Annie's life is finally thriving after facing agoraphobia, but a buried secret threatens to destroy everything.

[This is a stand alone story, also in the same universe as the others. It may be better enjoyed after reading "Stepping Out", however]

2018

Annie was sitting in her office at work. She admired the view from the window, adjusting her thick minus glasses on her nose. The frames were black and square, which, due to their size led to her lenses being enormous. Today had been a banner day; the software project on which she was lead engineer had been green lighted by her company and Annie was about to enjoy a big promotion. 

She looked down, admiring herself in her new suit. For years she had never been formal, yet lately she found that she loved how she looked in suits. She wore a black pleated skirt with matching jacket and a cream-colored blouse.

Annie paused to recollect how much her life had changed. For years, she had suffered from agoraphobia stemming from an incident where her friend had stolen her glasses and left her blind. Yet thanks to the help of her husband Todd, her brother David, and his girlfriend, Katie, as well as from a kind therapist, Annie had transitioned from working at home remotely to rising the ladder at her job, and from being a virtual shut in to being the center of a blossoming social life.

Her happy reflections were suddenly punctured by a text from David. 

"Annie, is everything okay? I thought you were going to come to the cemetery today".

Annie's heart started beating fast. Today was the fifth anniversary of their mother's death. Annie was still suffering from agoraphobia when her mother died in 2013, and wasn't even able to go to the funeral. She had felt guilty about this for years and had never even seen the gravesite.

"On my way" she texted back.

David and Annie were standing at their mother's grave. 

"Michelle St. Martin-Evans
1966-2013
Beloved Mother"

David laid a bouquet of flowers.

"I never thought I'd say this, but in a way I'm relieved" said Annie. "It's so peaceful here. I think Mom is finally at rest".

"I agree." said David.

Annie and David shared stories of their mother at the gravesite, drawing comfort from one another.

In the distance, a woman in her mid 50s watched. Her name was Kelley Greenwald. She wore a black pantsuit with matching prescription sunglasses. The sunglasses concealed her eyes, which were filled with tears. This anniversary was special to her too. For, unbeknownst to Annie and David, their mother had been Kelley's one true love.

1988

Michelle St. Martin woke up. She had just graduated from college several weeks before and had one final summer before she began work at a large engineering firm. She was one of only a handful of women who would be working in their engineering department and relished the role of being a trailblazer. 

Her thick glasses lay on the nightstand. They were drop-temple myodiscs with a -19 prescription. She patted the table and put them on. After a quick shower she put on a blue one-piece bathing suit. The suit hugged the contours of her generous rear and breasts. She put on sandals and went to the pool.

The day was already baking and sweat started to run down Michelle's nose. Her thick glasses slid down her nose, the myodisc sliding down below her line of sight. She slid them back up, her narrow but reliable field of view once again clear.

Kelley was sitting in a deck chair, people watching. She wore a pair of denim cutoffs and a black tank top. Her hair was dyed blond and cut short. Her blue eyes were framed by a pair of wire aviator glasses, with a prescription of -4, which, given the CR-39 plastic of the time and the area of her frames, yielded some serious edge thickness. Everything about Kelley screamed "rebel". She was openly gay at a time when that only brought stares and gasps, and her own family had disowned her years ago. If anything, though, that setback only hardened her resolve and made her more resilient.

She saw Michelle walk by. Her brown permed hair cascaded down her shoulders. She looked absolutely gorgeous and caught Kelely's eye right away. And those glasses! She'd never seen anything like them before. It looked like a lens within a lense, a tiny eye peeking out. 

As Michelle walked, her sandal caught on a snag and she tripped and fell. Her glasses slid off well out of her reach.

"My glasses!" cried Michelle, getting into the familiar routine of groping and feeling on her hands and knees. "Someone help! I can't see anything without my glasses".

With that Kelley rushed to her and picked up her glasses. "Ma'am, are these yours?" she asked.

Michelle reached out feeling frantically, finding Kelley's hand. "Yes!" She put them on and saw Kelley's smiling face. Kelley helped her off the ground.

"Oh my god, thank you so much!" said Michelle.

"No problem, beautiful" said Kelley, in a cocky way. "I'm Kelley".

"Michelle" said Michelle with a grin.

Both of them sat down. "I've never seen you at the pool before" said Michelle. "I've been coming here for years."

"I'm new in town" said Kelley. "Got a day job at the community college teaching art. That gives me time and money to work on my paintings. That's my true passion."

"Wow!" said Michelle, impressed. "I'm so terrible at art. I can't even draw a stick figure.

"Well then" asked Kelley, hands on her hips. "What is your passion?"

"Computers" said Michelle. "I graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. I just know that's our future and I want to be a part of it. Right now, though, I work part time at a grocery store. I do start an engineering job at the end of July, and I'm just taking it easy until then."

Michelle blushed a bit, self conscious. "I guess that's kind of dorky."

Kelley looked straight into Michelle's myodisced eyes. "Don't you ever put yourself down. Plenty of people will do that for you. That's amazing, Michelle."

Michelle smiled. "You're the first person I've met in a while saying that. Most people just call me a geek."

"I've never met a geek nearly as hot" said Kelley. 

Now Michelle was really blushing. Her glasses began to slide down her nose. "Stop it", she said, giggling.

"Really!" said Kelley. "You've got to be turning heads everywhere you go"

"Not really" said Michelle. "My last boyfriend's ego couldn't handle that I would be making more money than him, and well, just look at my glasses!"

Kelley arched her eyebrow, and put her hand on her hip. "Come on" she said. "Why would anyone have an issue with those?"

"Are you kidding?" asked Michelle, removing her glasses and showing them to Kelley. "Just look how thick they are!" She put them back on her face.

"Your glasses did catch my eye- I'd never seen anything like them before!" said Kelley. "I like the lens within a lens".

"They're called myodiscs" explained Michelle, "and I desperately need them to see anything. High myopia, a St. Martin tradition" she said with a laugh.

"Yeah, I need my glasses too" said Kelley. "But not as much as you do!" she said with a giggle.

Michelle smirked and playfully gave her the finger. Both of them laughed.

They spent all day at the pool, practically oblivious to everyone else there.

"Hey" said Kelley. "Do you want to catch a bite and watch TV at my house?"

"Yeah!" said Michelle. Let me get changed first and I'll meet you there!

Michelle had put on a white skirt and green tank top. She knocked on Kelley's door.

Kelley was wearing the same thing she wore to the pool. "Hey!" said Kelley. "Cute outfit!"

"Thanks" said Michelle.

After dinner, the two of them sat on the couch.

Kelley stared at Michelle.

"I just love your glasses" said Kelley. "I love what they do to your eyes. Can I try them on?"

"Sure!" said Michelle. "If you want to look through my coke bottles, go right ahead. My eyes need a rest anyway."

Kelley removed Michelle's glasses. For the first time, she truly saw Michelle's eyes. They were pale blue, and completely unfocused. Gorgeous.

Kelley looked through Michelle's glasses, sliding her own specs down. "These are pretty powerful" said Kelley.

"No kidding" said Michelle. Kelley watched as she blindly reached forward for the TV remote. She was nowhere near to it, and felt around on the table before finding it. She turned off the television. "Too loud." Michelle blindly turned to face Kelley, her eyes staring into the distance rather than at Kelley. "Is that okay if we keep it off for a while?"

Kelley felt her nipples harden and her clitoris swell. She had been lusting after Michelle since the moment her eyes spotted her through her thick aviator lenses. "Uh, sure" she said.

Michelle squinted. "Say, Kelley, can I have my eyes back?"

That was the last straw. Seeing Michelle so vulnerable, and so dependent on her glasses, to the point that she would call them "her eyes" made Kelley ache with desire. She quietly tossed off her shorts and tank top, and scooted over to Michelle. Kelley spread her legs and guided Michelle's hand to her soaked crotch.

"No, but you can have this" said Kelley.

Michelle patted and groped, and felt the contours of Kelley's labiae. She traced the labiae fully and could feel her clitoris. Her panties were damp and warm, and felt strangely inviting. Not like the times she had been with guys and felt around their penises. That didn't stop her from pulling her hand away eventually.

"Kelley, what the hell?" asked Michelle. "What are you doing?"

"I had to have you" said Kelley. "I thought you were interested too. I was coming onto you all day. Couldn't you tell?"

"No!" said Michelle. "I'm not a lesbo."

Kelley frowned. "You know, Michelle, have you ever considered being with a woman? You did take your time feeling around my crotch just now."

"That's not even an option!" said Michelle. "I have a job! A future! I can't jeopardize that and have everyone think I'm gay! I'll get fired!"

"And I don't?" said Kelley. She had tears in her eyes. "Because I'm not some engineer, I'm just trash?" asked Kelley.

Michelle was speechless, taken aback by Kelley's words.

"Take your fucking glasses" said Kelley, throwing them at Michelle's skirt. They bounced off and hit the carpet. Michelle started to feel around frantically. "Fuck you!"

"You really are blind!" screamed Kelley, now in tears. "Even glasses as thick as yours won't let you see!" She went to her bedroom and slammed the door.

Michelle found her glasses and put them on. She felt many things. Anger, hurt sadness, but beneath it all - arousal. She could not deny that she found Kelley attractive.

Michelle walked towards Kelley's room. Kelley was walking out, still in tears.

"Michelle, I'm so sor" blurted Kelley, before Michelle stopped her. She leaned into Kelley, wrapped her arms around her, and plunged her tongue into Kelley's surprised mouth in a passionate kiss. 

As they kissed, the groping hands of these two myopes, one greatly impaired and dependent on her myodiscs, the other with more mild visual issues, explored the other. Michelle's hand clamped down on Kelley's mound, through her panties. She brushed Kelley's clit with her thumb over her panties, but didn't penetrate her with her finger just yet. Kelley's lust toward her, and the way she was so hurt when Michelle rejected it, was something new for her. It made her feel powerful and she loved it.

Kelley, meanwhile, had one hand up Michelle's white skirt, the other grabbing on to her ample ass. She slid her fingers into her panties and felt how hard and swollen Michelle's clit was. "Who was she kidding" thought Kelley as she rubbed.

In short order, both had undressed one another and made their way to the bed. Kelley was on top of Michelle as both tasted the other's dripping pussy. Both still had their glasses on as well. Michelle's eyes, mere pinpricks under a mountain of plastic, concentrated intently as her long, nimble tongue fucked deep into Kelley, approaching her g-spot.

Kelley, in turn, guided her tight lips over Michelle's clit, applying pressure. Her shield-like aviator glasses were picking up quite a bit of Michelle's juices. Kelley could feel Michelle over her genitals, and came, squirting and bucking hard. This knocked Michelle's heavy myodiscs towards the floor.

"Hey!" said Michelle.

"Aww, can't see?" laughed Kelley. "You'll just have to feel around my body".

With that Michelle sat directly on Kellie's face, smearing her pussy all over Kelley's aviators. "Who's blind now?" asked Michelle. Kelley couldn't see anything. Michelle shoved her clit against Kelley's nose, along her chin. Kelley's tongue dove in until Michelle came too.

As Michelle came, the bridge of Kelley's aviators snapped. Now both women couldn't see. Kelley squinted through one lense of her mangled glasses, and helped guide Michelle as they cleaned up. Michelle found her own glasses and ended up being Kelley's eyes for a change. Both collapsed in bed. The night was intense. Sadly, neither knew that this tryst would lead to grief just as intense.

2018

Annie and David were leaving the cemetery. They looked back once more before getting in their car. Kelley had approached the grave.

"Who's she?" asked Annie.

"No idea" said David. "Maybe she knew Mom."

"Mom didn't have very many friends." said Annie. "After dad and Grandma and Grandpa died, I thought we were the only ones left who really knew her."

"Do you want to introduce ourselves?" asked David. "Yes" replied Annie.

They went back over to their mother's grave.

Kelley was standing at the grave, tears streaming down her face.

"It's me, Michelle" said Kelley. "I haven't visited in years and I'm sorry. I know we had our words, and we went our separate ways for a while, but I wanted you to know that I always loved you. Ever since I met you that one summer at the pool on South Street in 1988 I knew you were the one to whom I wanted to give my heart. I know you had a wonderful life, and you would have never traded your husband or children for anything. I loved you enough to let you go... but it never hurt any less". After the last sentence she started sobbing.

Annie and David heard the whole thing. They looked at each other. Could this woman have been their mother's lover? Everything she said about the swimming pool checked out where they knew their mother lived when she was younger. And why would this woman lie.

"Hi." said Annie. "Are you okay?"

Kelley turned to them. "You must be David and Annie. You look just like Michelle. Your mother spoke so fondly of both of you the last time I saw her at the hospice before she passed. Annie, she always knew you would get over your agoraphobia."

That checked out as well. "I know this must be frightening to you."

Indeed, had it been another time, Annie, in particular, would have been very frightened and skeptical. But not today. She reached over and gave Kelley a hug. "I can tell you loved our mother very much" said Annie, tearing up herself. "And we'd both like to get to know you. Everyone who knew our mother died a long time ago and we want to share the memories".

"I would like that" said Kelley.

The three of them left the cemetery together.
