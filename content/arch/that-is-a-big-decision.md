That is a big decision




Josh, is my name, I am a 9 year old boy, and have two older sisters, Jenny who is 11, and Amber is 12 years old.
We live in a nice house, which has a big backyard.
The summer holidays have just started, and I will busy playing baseball and other games, at the playground.




The house next door has been sold, and we are wondering who will be our new neighbour..
I will be missing Mr. And Mrs. Jones, I did a lot of little chores for them, and liked helping Mr. Jones,
with his garden, and always enjoyed the treats, Mrs. Jones used to give me.






While a big moving truck, is unloading next door, I watch to see if there might be a boy, my age to be friends with.
Then I noticed, that a car stopped in front of the house, and when the doors opened, two glasses wearing girls,
about the age of my sisters, a tall man, and a glasses wearing lady, came out of the car.
They went into the house next door, so now I know, who our new neighbours are.
When, I told my mother about our new neighbours, my sisters, wanted to to know about the girls.
and are excited, that perhaps they can have new friends.




It did not take long, to get to know our new neighbours, the girls are friends already, and I feel left out.
Mrs. Peters our new neighbour, wears glasses with lenses, that show a lot of rings, and make her eyes look small.
Looking at her, I wonder, how can she see? 
I don’t know anything about glasses, but there is something about a person wearing glasses, what is it?
I think glasses, make a person look more important, and smarter.
There are a few students in our school, who wear glasses, and they all are smart, 
Knowing, that I am not very smart, makes me wonder, should I be wearing glasses?




To day, my sisters, were telling my mother, that both girls next door, Kelley and Cindy, had their yearly eye exam, 
and now, they are wearing new glasses , and they look so nice wearing glasses, and they told us, that they like wearing glasses.
Both of us, have tried their glasses, and we think, perhaps we need to wear glasses. 
When are we going to have an eye exam?




My mother, went to see Mrs. Peters to find out, all about the girls, and their glasses.
Both Jenny and Amber are full of talk, about the glasses that your girls are wearing.
Mrs. Peters explained to my mother, that because she is a high myopic, had always expected, her girls to be myopic,
We all have a yearly eye exam, and at last year’s exam, we found out, that both girls,
are myopic, and have to wear glasses..
After this years exam, their prescription increased, so we had to buy the girls new glasses.
The ladies then talked, about vision, the neighbourhood, and some other women’s talk.




After the visit with Mrs. Peters, mother mentioned to us, that she had made an appointment, for our eye exams.




The day of the eye exam, my sisters are all excited, they are sure, they will be prescribed to wear glasses,
I know, that is what they were hoping for.
As soon as we entered the optical store, the girls went to the displays, and started to try glasses frames, to see, 
how they will look wearing glasses, and which frame they would like to wear.
While they were trying frames, I had my eye exam.
The doctor asked me, if I liked reading, and I told her I don’t like reading, and she asked me how well I did in school,
I told her not very good.
Josh, I think you will do better in school, and will like reading, when you wear glasses.
You have some astigmatism, and are farsighted,, and will have to wear glasses all the time.
I did not expect that, what a surprise, me having to wear glasses.
My mother was very surprised, when I handed her my prescription, and told her, that I need to wear glasses, 
While my sisters had their eye exams, my mother and I found what we thought, was a real nice frame for my glasses.
My sisters cannot believe, that I was prescribed to wear glasses, and they were not, and were not in a very good mood, 
when we went home.


The next day my mother and I went to get my glasses. 
When I first put them on, was not very happy, everything in the distance looked fuzzy.
The optician told me that if I wear my glasses all the time, I will be able to see as good, if not better wearing my glasses.
When she asked me to read a line, I noticed how much easier was to read, I like that.
My mother told me, I look like a smart young man, and she likes the way I look, wearing glasses,




Jenny and Amber went to see their friends next door, and tell them about their eye exam, and how Josh, 
was prescribed to wear glasses, and that they were told , no glasses for them.
We were sure, we would be prescribed to wear glasses, but no such luck.
Then Kelley asked them , do you really want to wear glasses?
Yes we sure do, we tried a lot of frames, and know exactly the kind we want.
I think, I have a solution, said Cindy.
How would you like, to borrow our old glasses, then you can wear glasses whenever you want.
They were our first glasses, and the prescription is about -1.00.
If you wear the glasses as much as you can, you might even become myopic like we are. 
We would love that.
After we were handed the glasses, and put them on, are so happy, we are wearing real glasses.
When we first put the glasses on, could not see to well, but realize, that the more we wear the glasses,
our vision will improve.
While wearing the glasses, we of course, had to see how we looked wearing glasses.






I now feel important, I am the only one who was prescribed to wear glasses.
My vision has improved so much for close work, that now I enjoy reading, and start to get used to my glasses wearing look.
All my friends have tried my glasses, and I know, some of them are wishing, they would need to wear glasses. 
When playing baseball, my hitting has improved, which gives me a good feeling.
I am almost sure that when we go back to school, I will be smarter.
Off course, I know now, what my sisters are doing, so that they to can wear glasses, it is fun to watch.






Now every time the girls get together, they all are wearing glasses.
Their favourite pastime is reading teen age magazines, about hairdo’s and make up, and playing games.
Both Jenny and Amber, can now see perfectly wearing the glasses, and sure would like to wear them all the time.




Jenny, mentioned the other day, that there are fifteen girls in her class, and seven of them are wearing glasses.
Why is it that of the fourteen boys in our class, only four are wearing glasses?
We both wear our glasses, when we are in school, but cannot forget, to take them off before we get home.




The other day, when we were in the mall, we noticed a store, that sold fake glasses.
Jenny look here, these frames look almost the same, as the glasses we are wearing.
Yes they sure are, I am going to buy a pair, I think the glasses are perfect, of what I have in mind.


When we came home, we were wearing the fake glasses.
When my mother asked us why we are wearing glasses? 
We told her that the glasses are fake, but are a fashion item now, and that in our class, almost all the girls wear glasses,
and we do not want to be left out.
Well, If wearing the glasses make you happy, wear them.
Now we are wearing fake glasses all the time, except when we go to school, then we wear the prescription glasses.
To day, coming home, I forgot to take my prescription glasses off, and put the fake ones on, surprise ! nobody noticed, 
so now we are wearing the prescription glasses all the time.


When we were due for our next eye exam, the girls had trouble with their vision, when not wearing their glasses.
Both sisters are now officially prescribed to wear glasses, and after they had started to wear their new glasses,
noticed the increase in their prescription, compared to the glasses they have been wearing,
They are so happy, they like the looks of the strong




Jenny loves her stronger prescription, but would like even stronger looking lenses, that show rings and depth, how to do that?
Well the answer came, before she knew it.
We now have a new girl in our class, Nicole, she wears glasses, with the type of lens Jenny loves.
It did not take long for Jenny, to be Nicole’s friend, and to start visiting back and forth.
Nicole has still all her old glasses, and now Jenny is trying all of Nicole’s old glasses, trying to induce more myopia.
Jenny tried Nicole’s -7.50 glasses, but after going over the collection, settled for a – 4.25.pair.
Now Jenny is wearing the -4.25 prescription, as much as she can, and was surprised, how fast she was having perfect vision,
wearing the stronger glasses, the only problem now, how can I wear the stronger prescription.




I spend a lot of time looking at everything I could find about vision and glasses, on the computer.
Now, I realize one way to do it is, wearing contact lenses and glasses, at the same time, to try and get a higher prescription.


I mentioned to my mother, that I would like to wear contact lenses.
She told me I can do that, but I will have to buy my own lenses, and to make an appointment with our optometrist, 
to get a contact lens fitting.




When I went to my appointment, I was all excited.
I plan to wear contacts and glasses at the same time, to get an over correction.
After the instructions, about sanitation of the lenses, and inserting and removing them, 
the optometrist handed me some lenses to wear, so I can get used to wearing contact lenses,
and see if I like wearing contact lenses.






I wore my contacts for a few days, and then went back to wearing my glasses.
When my mother asked why I was wearing my glasses again, I told her I did not like wearing contact lenses.
I prefer to wear glasses, I like how I look wearing glasses. 
Getting used to the increase in my prescription, when wearing the glasses over the contact lenses, took some time.
Now I figured, that since I have been wearing – 2.00 prescription glasses over – 2.00 contact lenses, and can see 
perfect, perhaps I should order some – 3.00 lenses.
I decided to wait, till I had my next eye exam.




We were very surprised, when our mother told us, that we had to go for an eye exam.
She wanted to make sure that we had the right prescription, because she was going to buy us contact lenses.
Your niece Brenda, is going to get married, and would like you girls to be part of the bridal party, 
but likes to see you wearing contact lenses, she does not really like the looks of glasses.




At the exam, the biggest surprise was, that my prescription had gone way up, to – 4.50.
Both my mother and the optometrist could not believe it, because my sister Amber’s prescription was only – 2.25
So now we are wearing our contact lenses, , and I cannot wait till the wedding is over, so I can wear my new,
- 4.50 glasses, and see some rings, and cut in, wearing a stronger prescription.
I love the looks of my new glasses, now I have to decide, will I try to make myself more myopic,
or hope that I might have some natural increases.
That is a big decision.
