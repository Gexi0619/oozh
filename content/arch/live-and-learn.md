description: A tale of two girls, Patricia and Amy, as they navigate through life with hearing and vision challenges.
---
Live and learn.


We are the proud parents, of two girls, Patricia and Amy.
Sometimes I wonder, why our girls, are so completely different.
Patricia, our oldest girl, is a perfect little lady, with straight blonde hair, 
and I think, looks a little like me, she is very obedient, and easy to get along with. 
She likes her story books, and likes reading and is very active, and likes helping me
around the house






Amy, has red curly hair, and I wonder why, there is not a redhead, in both of our family lines.
She sure has a temper, and, a mind of her own.
When she was about four years old, we started to realize, that she might have a hearing problem.
After a thorough examination, she was fitted with hearing aids.
Being able to hear properly, made her a whole new girl out of her..
She now listens, to all the children’s programs, and has become very active
She still has a mind of her own, and shows her temper quite often.




Patricia, is now going into grade three and Amy will be starting school after the summer break.
Now, is the time again, for their yearly eye exams.
The optometrist, prescribed glasses for Patricia.
I am not really surprised, because both my husband and I are myopic.
Patricia, started to wear her glasses, as soon as they were ready, and like a good girl, wears them all the time.




Amy told me, that she is glad she does not need to wear glasses, 
She does not like them, and when she is prescribed to wear glasses, she is not going to wear them, 
even, when the doctor tells her, she has to wear her glasses all the time. 
Well, we will have to see, what will what happen, when the time comes.




Patricia, has now been wearing glasses for three years, and at her last prescription, was almost – 3.00.
I am afraid she is going to be like me, a high myopic,, my last prescription was -12.00, and my husband is -6.00.
Amy still does not need to wear glasses.




Amy, likes the computer, and studies all kind of different subjects.
Lately, she has noticed, that her distant vision is not as good as it used to be. 
She has moved to seats, closer to the front, in her class room.
Because she wears hearing aids, she has excellent hearing, 
and writes down what the teacher is telling the class , so she does not have to copy,
what was written on the white board.
Nobody know, she wears hearing aids, her hair covers her ears.




Knowing she will an eye exam, during the summer, and might be prescribed glasses, 
that she does not want to wear, she wonders what she can do.
Remembering all the procedures, that takes place during an eye exam, she decided, to study
all the lines on the Snellen eye chart, 
When she knows, all the letters there are on each line., should fool the old doctor.






Getting ready for a new school year, we went for our yearly eye exam.
Patricia, had another increase in her prescription,.
When my exam was finished, I heard the doctor tell my mother, that he was sure, I was myopic, 
but could not figure out, how I could read all the lines, he asked me to read.
So it was decided, that if I noticed Amy, have any problem with distance vision, 
he would examine her eyes again.




No glasses for me, this year.
I will make sure, I sit close to the front in class, and listen really good, so I can do all my work correctly.
My marks, at my Christmas report, were good, so my mother was satisfied, that at the present time,
there was nothing wrong with my vision.







Our old eye doctor retired, and at my next exam, a nice young lady doctor examined my eyes.
I tried my old trick, being able to read all the lines, but she must have realized, something was wrong.
She changed the letters, that I had to read, and before I knew it, she had me to read lines of letters,
that I could not read. 
Then , I would hear some clicks, and was asked to read the letters again.
When the exam was finished, she told me I am quite myopic, and should be wearing my glasses full time.
She also told my mother, that she thinks, I should have been prescribed to wear glasses, at my last eye exam.
. 
My prescription is in the – 2.25 range. 
Mother did not seem very upset, about me having to wear glasses., she had been expecting it.
Because, she knows how I feel about wearing glasses,
had looked at all the frames, and suggested a pair, that she told me, would look so nice with my colour hair.
That is the pair, for me to wear, when they are ready. 




When we went to get our new glasses, and had them fitted, Patricia loved her new glasses. 
After I had my glasses fitted, I put my glasses in my pocket, I am not wearing glasses.
My mother, made me wear my glasses, and I had to wear them at night at meal time, 
so my dad could see, how I looked wearing my new glasses.
That is, about the only time, I wore my glasses, around the house.






When we started to go to school again, I refused to wear my glasses, and went back to my old routine,
of listening and making notes.
It worked well, because my grades were good
This past summer, I was fitted with a new pair of hearing aids, and they are so much better,
than my old ones, that I have no problem hearing everything perfectly.






I am now going to high school, still not wearing my glasses even with my glasses prescription 
in the -3.00 range, 
Sometimes I get mad at myself, because I can not see something clear, but I still refuse to wear my glasses.






My girl friend Amber, started to wear glasses, and she told me how fantastic glasses are.
She told me, she can now, see so much better, and loves her new glasses wearing look. 
She asked me, if I would like to try her glasses.
Amy, I would like to see, what you look like wearing glasses
So I put her glasses on.
Amy, you should be wearing glasses, you look fantastic wearing glasses.
No, thank you, I don’t want to wear glasses not right now.


Amber came for one of her regular visits, to my place,
When my mothers noticed Amber wearing glasses, commented how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Thank you, you should have seen, how nice Amy looks, wearing my glasses.
I think I know, but I never see her wear her glasses.
Amy, do you wear glasses?




I managed to get into the third year of high school, wearing my – 3.25 glasses.
I know I should wear my glasses, but I am not going to, I can see enough, 
listen and hear everything I need, to make notes.




My hairis always well styled, and my make up almost prefect, so I look my best.
At our school dances, I always have a good time.
There is one guy in our year, but not in my class, his name is Kevin, I like him,
I sure, would like to get to know him better, and perhaps have a date with him
He is so handsome, well groomed, fairly tall, and I noticed is a very good dancer.
I tried flirting, but to no avail, I cannot get him to notice me.




At the next school dance, I was again, looking as good as I could, hoping that Kevin might notice me. 
Tonight, keeping a close eye on Kevin, I noticed, he only asked girls, who wear glasses to dance with him.
He danced, for a while, with my girlfriend Amber, .
I watched them dance, and wondered, why he had not asked me.
What a surprise, when he asked me to dance with him.






When we were dancing, he asked me, if Patricia was my sister.
Yes she is, and after graduating last year, is now at our local college, taking a business course.
She always looked so nice wearing glasses, she looked fantastic.
How come, you don’t wear glasses ? 
I have noticed, that everybody else in your family wears glasses.
Well, I have glasses, that I only wear on special occasions.
I would love to see you, wearing your glasses.
The next special occasion, I will wear my glasses, and if you are there, you can see me wear my glasses.
What about coming with me, to see a movie ?
That will be great, and I will wear my glasses.






When I was getting ready for my date, my mother saw me wearing my glasses,
She could not believe, her eyes, that I was wearing my glasses,
and wondered why, I started to wear my glasses, when going on a date.






Kevin loved my glasses look, and told me, he thinks, I look beautiful wearing glasses,
and that I should wear my glasses all the time.
I think he has a glasses fetish, and loves the looks of girls wearing glasses. 
I don’t mind, I will make sure, I wear my glasses, when he is around.






To keep Kevin, I am now wearing my glasses, full time, so Kevin, can see me wearing my glasses..
I have received lots of comments, and questions about my glasses.
Now everybody, knows I wear glasses.


I have been wearing my glasses for a while now, and wonder why, I have been so stubborn ,
not wearing my glasses before.
My vision is so much better now, and many people, have told me they like my glasses wearing look.
