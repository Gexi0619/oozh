description: As Joe's severe nearsightedness brings them closer, Nicole becomes his eyes and their intimacy deepens.
---
I've been playing around with ChatGPT -- the new AI chatbot that can generate freakishly human like text, among other things.  I've had a few story ideas before but never did anything with them as I'm not all that great or interested in actually writing.  So I'd thought I'd try giving ChatGPT an outline a section at a time and seeing what it comes up with.  This is the result... maybe 10 minutes worth of work, if that.

 A New Level of Intimacy

Joe nervously took out his contacts as he settled into Nicole's bed for the first time. He had always been self-conscious about his severe nearsightedness, with a prescription of -12D. But as Nicole's eyes widened in surprise at the revelation, he couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement. The vulnerability of being unable to see without her help turned him on.

Nicole could see the excitement in his eyes and smiled, "Don't worry, I'll take good care of you," she said as she helped him navigate the room. Joe couldn't help but feel grateful and content as she guided him to the bed, her gentle touch sending shivers down his spine.

Nicole excitedly pulled out her phone and found the funny video she had been telling Joe about. "Here, let me show you," she said as she handed him the phone.

Joe took the phone and brought it close to his face, squinting as he tried to focus on the screen. Nicole watched in surprise as he had to hold the phone just inches away from his eyes to make out the video. She had never realized just how bad his eyesight was.

"Wow, your eyes are really bad," she exclaimed.

"Yeah, I've been nearsighted since I was a kid," Joe replied sheepishly, feeling embarrassed.

But Nicole reassured him, "It's nothing to be ashamed of. I think it's kind of cute," she said as she leaned in and kissed him.

Joe smiled, feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders. He was so used to hiding his eyesight, but with Nicole, he felt comfortable being himself. They watched the video together, laughing and enjoying each other's company.

The next morning, Joe woke up early to surprise Nicole with breakfast in bed. As he fumbled around the kitchen, trying to find the ingredients and utensils he needed, Nicole woke up to the sound of clattering pots and pans.

She got up and walked into the kitchen, where she saw Joe struggling to see. He was squinting as he tried to read the labels on the jars and bottles. She could see the frustration on his face as he struggled to make breakfast.

But Nicole didn't see frustration, she saw vulnerability, and it made her heart swell with love. She walked over to him and wrapped her arms around him. "Let me help you," she said softly.

Joe was grateful for the offer and they worked together to make breakfast. She helped him read the labels, and he cooked the food. Together, they created a delicious meal that they enjoyed together.

As they sat down to eat, Joe looked at Nicole and said, "Thank you for helping me, I couldn't have done it without you."

As Joe reached for his contacts, he realized that they were both torn. He felt a wave of panic wash over him as he realized he had no other pairs and no glasses. He knew that this meant he would be helpless for days until he could get new contacts or glasses.

Nicole saw the look of dismay on Joe's face and immediately knew something was wrong. "What's wrong?" she asked.

"My contacts are both torn," Joe replied, "I don't have any other pairs or glasses. I'm going to be helpless for days now."

Nicole's face lit up with excitement, "That's okay, I'll take care of you," she said, "I'll be your eyes until you get new contacts or glasses."

For the next few days, Nicole helped Joe with everything. She would guide him around the house, help him read, and even drive him around for errands. It was a new experience for Joe, but he couldn't help but feel grateful for Nicole's help and her love.

Nicole knew that Joe couldn't go on without proper vision, so she took him to an eye doctor right away. The doctor confirmed that Joe's prescription was -12D, one of the highest degree of nearsightedness and that it would take several days to make glasses in his prescription and several weeks to get his special order contacts.

Feeling helpless, Joe tried to pick out some frames for his glasses, but he couldn't see well enough to make a decision. Nicole saw him struggling and came to his aid. She helped him pick out some frames that would suit his face and compliment his features.

A few days later, Joe and Nicole went grocery shopping together. As they navigated the store, Joe struggled to see the products clearly. Everything was just a blur of colors and shapes.

As they were picking out produce, they got separated. Joe didn't want to hold Nicole back, so he decided to continue shopping on his own. But as he walked through the store, he realized that he couldn't identify anyone. Everyone just looked like colored blobs to him. He felt a wave of panic wash over him as he realized he was lost and alone in the store.

Just as he was about to give up and ask for help, he heard Nicole's voice calling out his name. He turned around and saw her waving at him. She had been looking for him the whole time.

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to worry you," Joe said.

"It's okay, I'm just glad you're safe," Nicole replied, giving him a hug.

As they drove home from the grocery store, Nicole was curious about what Joe could see. She turned to him and asked, "What can you see right now? What can't you see? Describe it to me."

Joe thought for a moment, "I can see the general shapes of things, but everything is blurry and unclear. Cars look like colored blobs on the road, and people look like shadows. I can't make out any details or facial features."

Nicole listened intently, "What about street signs or billboards?"

"I can't read them, they're just a blur," Joe replied.

Nicole found herself getting turned on by this game of describing what Joe could and couldn't see. She couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to be the only one he could see clearly.

As they continued to drive, they talked about other things Joe could and couldn't see, and they both found themselves getting more and more turned on.

Joe felt a sense of vulnerability but also a sense of excitement, he had never shared this part of himself with anyone before. He felt loved and accepted by Nicole, who was not only willing to help him but also curious to know more about him.

A few days later, Joe and Nicole decided to go to a swimming pool together. They had planned to meet outside of their respective locker rooms but as Joe walked out, he couldn't tell which person was Nicole. He squinted and tried as hard as he could to make out her figure but everyone looked like a blur.

As he walked around looking for her, he felt a sense of frustration. He wished he could see her clearly, especially because she had told him she had picked out a new bikini for the occasion.

Finally, Nicole found him and walked up to him. She was wearing a stunning bikini and Joe couldn't help but feel disappointed that he couldn't really see what she looked like in it.

Nicole could see the disappointment on his face and knew what he was thinking. She took his hand and said, "Come closer." Joe leaned in, getting very close to her, as she guided his hands to feel the bikini fabric and the way it accentuated her curves.

The intimacy of the moment and the physical contact turned them both on. They couldn't help but feel a strong chemistry between them.

The doctor's office called to say that Joe's glasses were in and ready to be picked up. Joe and Nicole eagerly headed to the optometrist. When they got there, Joe put on the glasses, but to his dismay, he couldn't see anything through them.

The optician apologized and explained that there had been a mistake made in the lab and they had accidentally made the glasses with a +12D prescription instead of the -12D prescription that Joe needed.

Joe felt disappointed and frustrated. He had been looking forward to being able to see clearly again. Nicole could see the disappointment on his face and knew he was feeling helpless.

But Nicole was excited that he would need her help for a few more days. She reassured him that everything would be alright and that they would get through it together.

The optician apologized again and said it would be several more days to get some glasses that worked for him. Joe tried to stay positive and reminded himself that at least he had Nicole by his side to help him through it.

That night, Joe and Nicole had a dinner date planned. Nicole got dressed in a stunning and sexy blue dress that she had picked out especially for the occasion.

As they were getting ready to leave, Joe couldn't help but notice how beautiful Nicole looked in her dress. However, all he could see was that it was blue. He could not make out the details of the dress.

Nicole could see him trying hard to see it and she smiled. She invited him to get as close as he needed to in order to examine the dress. Joe walked up to her and got within a couple of inches of her. He examined the dress, feeling the fabric and tracing the lines of the dress with his fingers.

The intimacy of the moment and the physical contact was both exciting and intense. They were both so excited by this that they found themselves breathing heavily.

Nicole felt a shiver run down her spine as Joe's fingers traced the lines of the dress on her skin. They were both caught up in the moment, the intensity building between them.

At the dinner, Joe struggled to make out what was on the menu. He had to get very close to it and squint to try to make out the words. Nicole offered to read it for him, but he insisted that he could make it out as long as it was close enough.

Feeling determined, he memorized what he wanted and told the waiter his order. The waiter asked what side dish he would like, and Joe found himself embarrassed as he had to hover inches from the menu and close one eye to see it.

The waiter noticed his struggle and kindly offered to help. He said that they keep a few pairs of reading glasses on hand for situations like this, but he explained that they would do nothing to help Joe's severe nearsightedness. Joe thanked him for the offer, but declined.

Feeling slightly embarrassed, Joe couldn't help but feel a twinge of self-consciousness about his eyesight. But Nicole reassured him, telling him that she loved him for who he was and that his eyesight didn't change that. Joe felt grateful for Nicole's support and the love she showed him.

Despite this small setback, the rest of the night went smoothly, and they enjoyed their meal together, laughing and talking. Joe realized that he could still have a great time and make memories, even with his poor eyesight.

The next day, Joe received his new glasses and was excited to finally be able to see again. However, when he put them on, he was surprised to find that the lenses were incredibly thick and made his eyes appear small in comparison.

Nicole was astonished when she saw the glasses. She had never seen glasses with such strong prescription before. She couldn't help but admire how hard Joe had to work to see the world.

Joe explained that the glasses did not have any high index lenses and that is why the lenses were so thick. He also said that he had gotten used to this and it would not stop him from enjoying life.

When they were back home, Nicole couldn't resist the opportunity to show off her stunning blue dress to Joe again, now that he could finally see it clearly. She modeled the dress for him, twirling around and striking different poses.

As Joe admired the dress, Nicole impulsively pulled his glasses off and said, "get close to me to see it like you had to before." Joe hesitated for a moment, but then did as she asked, getting as close as he could to her.

The intimacy of the moment, combined with the excitement of finally being able to see her dress clearly, was too much for both of them to handle. They couldn't stand it anymore and they both got so excited that they couldn't help but to kiss each other passionately.

Nicole put Joe's glasses on and was flabbergasted by their strength. She couldn't see anything through them, everything was just a blur. She turned to Joe, who was also struggling to see without his glasses, and they both laughed.

With the world a blur around them, they found their way to the bedroom. They stumbled a bit, but they were both excited by the idea of being able to navigate the room without being able to see.

Once they reached the bed, they lay down next to each other, both of them unable to see, but both feeling more connected than ever before. They closed their eyes and just let themselves feel the moment, letting their other senses take over.

They explored each other's bodies with their hands and mouths, feeling their way around in the darkness. It was a new experience for both of them, but they were excited to be experiencing it together.

They were both so excited that they couldn't stand it anymore and they both reached the peak of pleasure. They lay there in silence, holding each other, feeling grateful for each other and the bond that they shared.
