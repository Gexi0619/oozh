description: A young boy discovers the benefits of wearing glasses and learns to embrace his new accessory.

When you are a young boy growing up , some things you see impress you more than others.Since there are so many interesting things around, you soon realize that some impress you more than others.

We have a new teacher, she has very nice hair an wears glasses.
I think she looks very nice, but when she looks at you, her blue eyes look very big, almost as if she can 
see right through you.
I wonder if her eyes are that big , or that they look that big because she wears glasses.
I don t know very much about glasses, nobody in our family wears glasses.
There seems to be something very interesting about those eyeglasses , I like to know more about them
I wonder what it would be like to wear glasses and have big eyes like that.

When I talked to my friend Kevin and what he thought about the teachers big eyes, he told me 
that some eyeglass lenses magnify, and they make your eyes look bigger.
Kevin then told me that his father and mother wear glasses like that, and their eyes look bigger, it is 
because of the lenses in the glasses.
He told me also  that his parents had made an appointment for him to have his eyes examined
next week, they are sure that he needs to wear glasses , because he is having to much trouble reading.

About a week later Kevin came to school wearing glasses.
His glasses had the same type of lenses as our teacher s glasses, but not as strong, his eyes only looked a little bigger
I liked the looks of his glasses  and the way his eyes looked , and I told him so.
He let me try his glasses.
When I put the glasses on , I noticed that everything in the distance  looked a little fuzzy,
but when i looked at a book on the desk, all the letters were nice and clear, reading them was no problem .
I could not believe  that I could see all the letters so nice and clear , just because of wearing glasses 
I found the glasses comfortable and liked the feeling of them on my face.
I would not mind having to wear glasses , if they made reading that much easier.

When I came home from school , I told my mother all about Kevin s glasses , and how easy it was to read when wearing his glasses , all the letters were so nice and clear.
My mother was very surprised when she heard about my experience wearing Kevin s glasses.
She discussed it with my dad that night, since nobody in the family wore glasses , they realized that not knowing very much about vision problems, that perhaps I should have my eyes examined.
So they made an appointment for me, to find out if I needed to wear glasses.

Kevin had told me what an eye exam was like, that it did not hurt and was very interesting.
I sure was excited when I went for my eye exam.
Reading the letters on the wall chart was no problem at all, so I figured no glasses for me.
That all changed when the doctor asked me to read tiny letters  lines  on a  card.
I told the doctor that I could not read the letters because the card was to close.
Then I heard a few clicks and the letters came into perfect focus.
I told him that it was much better now, I could see all the letters nice and clear.
Then I heard some more clicks ,and the doctor asked me which was best 1 or 2. 3 or 4 and on and on.
When he was finished , the doctor told me I needed to wear glasses, I was farsighted and had some astigmatism.
My mother was very surprised , she had not expected that I would need to wear glasses.
I would be the only one in the family to have to wear glasses .
She helped me select a frame , that she said made me look like a studious young man .
When the glasses were ready and I put them on , everything far away looked fuzzy , just like when I had tried Kevin s glasses .
But when I looked art the reading material close by, all the letters were nice and clear no problem to read them.
The optician told me that if I wore my glasses all day, in a couple of weeks my far away vision would be perfect.
When I looked at myself in the mirror, I noticed my eyes looked a little bigger , I liked that 
The glasses were comfortable to wear ,and I liked my new look wearing glasses.
After wearing my glasses a couple of weeks my vision was perfect  for near and far.
I was really happy with my glasses.

After the Christmas holidays , there were 3 more kids in my class wearing glasses now.
When I looked at all of them, noticed that the glasses of two of them made their eyes look smaller, I did not like that.
The other one had lenses like I have , they magnified.
That is when I started to learn about myopia and hyperopia and the difference in the lenses.

When I was in high school, after I had worn glasses for about 6 years, I still liked wearing glasses.
My prescription is now = 3.00  for the left , and + 2.75  for the right eye, and some astigmatism.

I have always liked the looks of girls , but I prefer the ones that wear glasses.
I dated some girls who wore glasses for myopia, but I preferred the looks of larger eyes ,
so I tied to date only girls who wore glasses for hyperopia 

After the Christmas break  a new student came into our class.
She seems a bit shy, but she is a very pretty well build blonde.
I noticed that her eyes did not look right, they looked reddish, not healthy.
After looking at her for a few minutes  , noticing the trouble she seemed to be having with her eyes , I finally had the nerve to ask her if she had a problem with her eyes.
I introduced myself , told her my name was Logan.
She told me her name was Ashley,
That her family had just moved here , and that she liked the area.
Then she told me that the trouble with her eyes was because she was wearing contact lenses
Why don t you wear your glasses?
My glasses are ugly, and make my eyes look so big, I don t want my new classmates to see them
Well it sounds you have the same vision problem that I have.
Believe me around here nobody seems to care if you wear glasses, or what kind tou wear.
So many of the students wear glasses now, they won t even notice your glasses.
Do yuor self a favor and wear your glasses , and give your eyes a rest.
So the next day Ashley came to school wearing her glasses.
Her prescription was stronger than mine, that made her eyes look larger.
I complimented her on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
She thanked me , and told me how much better she felt now wearing her glasses.
She soon realized nobody commented on her glasses, and she felt much better about wearing them.
We became good friends , and had a few dates.

Ashley was due for an eye exam,
She was afraid that she would have another increases in her prescription, and her lenses would be thicker, and look more like the bottom of Coke bottles.
I mentioned that he should ask for aspheric lenses , they are thinner and lighter  and give you better viasion.
Because they are flatter at the front , you should ask for an anti reflective coating to eliminate glare.
I read up on all the information on my computer, and I think you will be happy with that type of lens.

Ashley had her eye exam and as she has expected an increase in er prescription, she was now 
+5.75 on the right and + 5.50 on the left  eye and some astigmatism.
She talked to the optician , and ordered aspheric lenses with an anti reflective coating .
When her glasses were ready and she put them on and looked at herself in the mirror
was very happy the way her glasses looked.
She loved her new look , she never had been so happy wearing  glasses , these glasses were just great.

When I saw Amy wearing her new glasses , I could not believe my eyes she looked fantastic
She thanked me for suggesting the aspheric type  lenses , she loved her new glasses.
 When I had my next eye exam, and my prescription went up to + 4.75, I ordered aspheric lenses
and coating and was very happy how nice my new glasses looked.

Ashley and I went out a number of times but we never became serious .
After graduating from high school we lost track of each other .
Now I am looking for a girl who wears glasses for hyperopia  and who loves me, and I love her 
so we can get married and have a family of hyperopic children.
