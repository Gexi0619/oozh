description: "Jennifer's descent into temptation leads to unexpected consequences, forcing her to confront her own eyesight."
---
My name is Jennifer. My story starts just before my 16th birthday.

After school my friend talked me into going to a hideaway that a lot of the girls had built in the woods.
I was reluctant to go but she said don't be a spoil sport.
Many of the girls were already there; they were all sitting in a circle taking swigs from a bottle of gin before passing it around.
This is not what I wanted to join in with.but my friend insisted I took a swig from it. I hated the taste of it, then she passed me a lighted cigarette. I did not know what to do with it, I just put it in my mouth and sucked it. I started to cough vilanty. As I got up I was violently sick. I vowed that was the first and last time I would drink or smoke.
I rushed to get away from the woods ,when I reached the gate I realised I had left my bag Behind. As soon as I got in the house I rang my friend but she said she had already left and was home.
It was too dark now to go back to the woods on my own and I daren't  tell my parents were I had been,
I woke early the next morning and told my mother that I had to get to school early
I spent over an hour that morning searching for my bag.what I did not tell you was that both my phone and iPad were in it.how was I going to explain the loss.

That evening I told my mother that I had left my bag on the bus.she was angry, and rang the bus company, they said nothing had been found.
My Father said we can't afford to buy you a new iPad and a phone.

I thought for a while, then suggested that if I gave them all my birthday money next week could they buy me an iPhone and I did not need an iPad as well.

Later that evening my mother told me that father had reluctantly agreed.

For the first 3 months it was wonderful, so much less to carry.
I don't know what was wrong with the phone but I suddenly found it harder to use the iPhone at night, maybe when phones get older the screens are not as good. I had forgotten my mother's phone is older than mine and she puts glasses on now to use her phone.
But my eyesight is perfect. I can see miles away haha.

It's been 6 months  now since I got my iPhone. I noticed mum had got new glasses. I wonder why, maybe she is having the same problem with her phone like me.

Mum and Dad are staying out late today, so mum has left me a meal to warm up in the microwave.i noticed mum had left her old glasses on the worktop next to her cooking book.
I picked them up to put back in there case, I had never held them before, I wondered why they were here,what was it like to wear glasses,

I nervously put them on,I looked acrossI the room,everything was a blur, I quickly took them off, why did mum wear these things they made everything worse.

While I was eating my meal I continued working. I kept wondering why mum had them,I had to try them again, I put them on again it was just the same everything straight ahead was all blurred, I looked down for the case as I was just about to take them off, suddenly everything was crystal clear on my phone that I still had in my hand.
Now I realised why mum put them on to use her phone.

I carefully removed them and took them with me into my bedroom,I sat at my desk and hesitantly put them back on.it was like magic. The print looks not only bigger but so much brighter and clearer.
I kept them on for the next 2 hours,then suddenly I heard a car in the drive. I quickly took them off and hid them in my draw.

I woke early the next morning to finish my homework,It was so difficult to read the text that I wanted to put the glasses back on.

What has happened to my eyesight? It's almost impossible to read my phone now.I have to lock myself in my bedroom at night and put mums reading glasses on to catch up with my school work. I can see what is written on the board with no trouble  but after I have written my notes down I have to squint to read them.is that why mum got new glasses..

I can't be seen at school wearing reading glasses. I'm only 16 years old,not 40..

It's now been 3 months  since I started to use mum's reading glasses. It is  starting to get difficult to read the smaller print again now, is that why mum got new glasses..

I don't have to take them off when I go downstairs to get a drink, in fact I like keeping them on all the time when my parents are out. is that why mum got new glasses..

My parents have been invited to a business weekend,so they asked if I would be on my own from Friday morning until late Sunday night. I said that was fine .

As soon as they had gone out I put MY reading glasses on.ok they weren't really mine but I needed them so that's why I called them mine.

It was getting much harder to read now even with My glasses on,I kept them on all evening. I even forgot to take them off when I watched TV..

I went into their bedroom to close the curtains, that's when I saw a glasses case on mum's bedside table.
I excitedly opened it.
They were not the reading glasses I had seen before .had she got a new pair or had she bought 2 pairs one for in her bedroom 

I excitedly put them on, I then realised they were new as they were much stronger than the other pair she had. I couldn't see the other side of the bedroom. I quickly took them off and put on MY glasses I hurriedly returned to my room clutching mum new reading glasses
I excitedly got the cleaning cloth out. The lens felt different. They seemed thicker in the middle this time, there was a small piece of paper in the case but the writing was too small for me to read even with MY Glasses,so I had to put mums on. It was amazing I could read the paper so easily.

I kept them on for about an hour before going to bed.

I woke early the next morning  when I was getting breakfast my eyes started to feel strange without any glasses on.so I went back to my bedroom and put (MY) the first pair of mums glasses back on. Within 10 mins my eyes felt more relaxed.

Cleaned the kitchen  and went into the back garden to water the plants.

I suddenly realised that I still had (MY) glasses on and everything was so beautifully clear and sharp now.

It was a lovely morning so I decided to do my studying in the garden .I returned to my bedroom and picked up my phone and mums new glasses
I spent the next 3 hours searching on the internet. I was feeling hungry as I got up. I realised I could  not see to walk with these glasses on.i took them off everything looked strange so i put (MY) glasses back on. 
The rest of the day I wore mum's reading glasses all the time ,only changing when I had finished studying then putting mine back on.

The next morning I woke early again this time I put (MY) glasses on straight away.

I had  to go to the library.
What should I do? I needed to take mum's new reading glasses with me.als I had never been outside in public wearing glasses, but without  MY glasses on I found I got a headache and it was more difficult to see, even the distance now looks sharper wearing MY glasses.
So I put my best clothes on, and borrowed  some of mum's makeup,then completed the transformation by putting MY GLASSES on .

It was wonderful walking down the street. I even passed 2 of my classmates. I just said hello and carried on walking. They never recognised me.

When I got to the library I sat down and changed glasses  and spent the rest of the morning studying. I had to put my glasses back on when I went to the restaurant,after lunch I returned to continue with my studying. That's when I realised I could not read my phone any longer with my glasses on.

What was I going to do? I couldn't keep mum's new reading glasses.and without them I couldn't see to study.

I hit on a plan took the reading glasses off and put MINE back on,I went straight home to search for the paper that went with my glasses . Well mums first glasses
I looked at mum's bedside table. There was a prescription there but was it for the first pair of glasses or mum's second pair that she must have taken with her.
I squinted to read nit with (MY) glasses on, but had to get the reading glasses out of my bag.

I returned to town and went to a different optical store to the name on the prescription it also had a 2 for 1 offer on.

Before entering the shop I removed my glasses .
I told them my mother was away and had her bag stolen and had asked me to buy her the replacements and as they had an offer I had had to choose them.

The lady asked what frames my mother wanted .
This was a problem. I did not know what to say.

The assistant suggested I try some frames on and choose what I liked .

I had to admit I enjoyed trying them on.I decided on a round metal Harry potter style in rose gold for MY outdoors  glasses and tortoiseshell for what I was going to call MY reading glasses.

The lady asked if I thought mum would like the lens thinned if so the cost would be an extra €20 for each pair as any extras had to be paid for.
The free pair came with a basic C39 lens.i told the lady mum had not sent me enough money for that.

The lady told me to come back at 6pm.
As soon as I got outside I immediately had to put MYglasses back on.

I enjoyed walking around the mall.i heard the clock striking 6pm 

 I rushed back to the shop,
There was a different lady there now so I just gave her my name.
She opened both case 
 
The gold frames look very nice madam they will suit you more than the pair you have now,have you had them a long time.

What did she mean?

"If you take YOUR glasses off I with adjust your new ones for you"

I suddenly realised that I still had MY, OK mum's first pair of reading glasses on,I had not only got so used to wearing them but I was becoming dependent on them outside now”

She hooked the cables over my ears 

“They will take you a few days to get used to them everything in the distance will look blurred but your eyes Will soon relax and distance will look clear and sharp to them.They are a considerable stronger than prescription you have now"

She was correct that the distance was not as good but I could just read the first line of the card she gave me to read.

" Let's try Your reading glasses on"
"You are rather young to need such a high prescription to read with"
"But we are seeing many more young girls that need reading glasses now"
"You all spend to much time using iPhones"

"I'm sorry YOUR new lenses are rather thicker than YOUR old pair.
Especially YOUR reading glasses"

She placed my new rose gold Harry potter glasses back on me.
"I need to put all your details on the computer.the other lady just wrote a card with your name on it.

"Jennifer Jones age 16”

She looked up at me in surprise.

“That is exceptional young age to need such powerful reading glasses, you look older than that"

“Wait while I put your prescription details in"

"The glasses you were wearing today how long have you had them"

What could I say.

"About a year I stuttered"



She took MY old glasses and put them in front of the machine then wrote.

“is this the first time you have needed reading glasses as well”

I nodded

“Did the Dr suggest you wore bifocals instead of having to change glasses to read”
I just shook my head,I didn't know what she meant.

"If I were you I would go and have a coffee in the Mall and sit for a while to get used to the new prescription.

Mum rang to ask if I was ok and dad needed to stay untill Tuesday. Did I want her to come home Sunday?

I replied that I was ok.

In fact I was pleased because I had a lot of school work to catch up with.
I was starting to get worried.I had become  totally dependent on wearing  mums reading glasses for doing my homework. Also, I had been putting my new rose gold distance  glasses on as soon as I woke up.

I was in bed when my parents arrived back  so mum just popped her head around the corner of my room to say night night.

Wednesday Morning I woke up and I really needed to put My glasses on ,but how could I explain everything? I hurriedly packed everything including both pairs of glasses.

 I gave my mum a quick kiss and said I had to go to  the library early .

It was strange not wearing glasses now.
There was a bus coming and I panicked. I couldn't read the service number ,I needed to put MY DISTANCE GLASSES on.
Too late the bus had passed.


Nobody was looking ,I had to put my distance glasses on.
Luckily I didn't have to wait long for my bus.

As soon as I got to the library I changed my glasses.

I was so busy that I didn't hear someone asking me if they could sit next to me 

"Hi Jennifer I didn't know your wore glasses  you look cool your eyes look bigger"

I looked up and squinted and realised that it was Martian.
I quickly remove my reading glasses
,
"Why have you taken your glasses off Jennifer" 

"I only need them for reading Martian"

I went to open the case to put my reading glasses back in. I gasped when I opened the wrong case it had my rose gold distance glasses in.

"Why have you got 2 pairs.the gold ones look very nice as well can I see you wearing them"

He took them out of the case and handed them to me.I felt myself going red as I shyly put them on.

"Wow you look very pretty wearing them,I alway thought you needed glasses since you got your iPhone".

“But why do you have 2 pairs Jennifer?”
 I went red then explained that I should wear these all the time now and the others were for reading.

"So why don't you wear them all the time Jennifer?"

I had no option but to explain everything.and tell him I was too shy to wear them at school because I would get teased and bullied even more and my parents don't know.


"Shall we go to McDonald's for lunch? I will treat you.

As I went to take My rose gold glasses off, Martian closed the case then put my reading glasses in the other case before putting both cases into my bag.
.
"It's time you started to wear your glasses more, so you had better start now"

What was happening ,Martian was the boy that all the girls wanted to be seen with..

And we were now walking towards McDonalds with me wearing my glasses and him holding my hand and carrying my bag for me.

While we were eating our meal my phone bleeped. It was an SMS message. I tried to ignore it as I knew I couldn't read it .Martian and I just looked at each other as it bleeped again.
Then Martian opened my bag and took the case with my reading glasses out.

"I think you should put your reading glasses Jennifer"

He handed me my reading glasses.he even smiled as I put them on.

*Your eyes look bigger and very beautiful.Why don't you keep them on incase another message comes in"


Over the next few months we became good friends and spent a lot of time together 


Mum and dad will be away for a week starting tonight they wanted me to stay with my Aunty,but I explained that even though it was a school holiday I had a lot of homework 

Every Morning Martian meets me at the corner of my road.I love it when he takes my glasses case out of my bag and puts MY distance glasses on me ; I think Martin had noticed I couldn't see the bus numbers now without any glasses.
We  had just sat down in the bus when my phone beeped.
 I handed Martian  my phone.
"Can you read it for me to save me putting my reading glasses on.please"

What I didn't say was that I had started to find it difficult to read it, even with my reading glasses on 

"It's a reminder that you have an appointment for your 3 months eye check at 11am today.
"If we get off at the next stop we can walk there,would you like me to come in with you dear"


"Good morning Miss Jennifer it's nice to meet you I see it's the first time we have tested your vision"
"Have you noticed any changes since we Dispensed your last prescription" 

Before I had time to answer, Martian said.
"I Think Jennifer has notice that she can't see as well now as when she got these glasses"

I nodded in agreement.
I didn't know what to expect because this was the first time I had actually been tested if you remember I used my mother's prescription.

First I had to read letters on the wall this I found very difficult, but then as he added different lens I was able to read more lines

But when he gave me a card to hold and read I had great difficulty to start with everything was double 


"Well Miss I expect you realise there has been a big change in your prescription 
I'm not sure if you were given the correct prescription before" 
"We are still doing the buy one second pair free,but I suggest you have the thinner lens this time, but it will add €100  to the cost" 

Martian looked surprised


"When should Jennifer have her next test"

"I would recommend 3 months again in case we see the same change again"

"Do you think Jennifer eyes Will change much"


"Well it's difficult to tell ,but she is showing all the signs of being extremely long sighted also she has developed more astigmatism especially in her right eye and I have had to add a prism to her right lens 

I said I couldn't afford the extra €100 for the thinner lens  if they were only going to last me 3 months. Martian agreed and said he didn't mind if my lens were thicker.

"This is your prescription we can have them ready in and hour for you.when your eyes have settled I would recommend you wear bifocals"

We had lunch then went back to collect my new  glasses..
When the lady opened the case I was shocked how much thicker the lens looked in my new larger rose gold frames. 
Martian said he loved them.

“It will take you a few days to get used to to stronger lens, your eyesight has changed a lot since you were tested last”

If I thought the lenses were thick in this pair. The lens in MY reading glasses were even thicker.


“Why are the lenses so thick in my reading glasses and what are those lines I can see on the right lens?

“Did the doctor not explain? Your vision in your right eye has deteriorated a lot. Also you have a significant increase now in your astigmation and the doctor has added a prism in your right lens to keep your eye straight,  You will feel that eye being pulled at first”.
“You have very weak eye muscles for a person of your age”

Martian held my hand as we walked to the library. 
“Don't cry dear, you look beautiful wearing your new glasses .  
“My sister is very short sight and has to wear Myodisc lens that make her eyes look small looking through the 2 small circles”
“Your lens make your eyes look bigger and more beautiful”
“I love your large eyes dear”

“Come Here let me Wipe Your eyes dear”
“We need to go to the library”

“You had better put your new reading glasses on Jennifer

“Ok Martian will you get them out of the case for me”
“Oooo the right lens is so much thicker than I realised, it bulges out in the middle,much more than my other lens and it has so many lines on it”
“I can't be seen wearing them”
“I don't want to wear them”
“Please don't make me wear them Martian”
“Please let me try reading with my old reading glasses on”

“You know you can't see to read in your old ones”
 “Come here Jenny please let me put your new ones on you”
“I will sit opposite you” 
“Ok”

I don't know why? But I always get an excited feeling when he hooks the cables over my ears.

“Don't let anyone see me please dear. I feel so ugly wearing them and I can feel my right eye being pulled and they are so much heavier”

“You still look just as pretty dear”

 Here's your iPhone dear lets get on with our work”

“Is that better, don't worry nobody is looking at us”

“Oooo yes thank you, I really can see the print so much better now. Do you really want me to keep them on? I'm sure I must look so ugly wearing them,but I do need to catch up with my homework.

"Can we stop now Martian my right eye is starting to hurt a little "
"Yes that's a good idea.The doctor did say you might find your right eye pulling at first"

"Let's got to McDonalds again"

Martian handed me my new distance glasses 
"Do I really have to wear them Martian if I hold your hand I can manage,one of my school friends has started working there"

"That's silly,we can go to KFC.

Martian picked up my gold framed glasses and hooked the cables over my ears.

We found a nice table outside and nobody near us.
Martian picked up my phone and reading glasses case from the shopping bag.

"You had better message your mum and ask if it ok we go to the cinema later I will go and order"

After the meal I thanked him and said  that I needed to go to Tesco's food shopping. Mum had sent me  a rather long list.

"Would you like me to come and help you I'm free all day"

"Thank you Martian,that would be very kind of you"


Martian said he needed to go to the Gents and suggested I wait by the door for him.

I took my reading glasses off and put them in Their case.
I did not want to be seen on my own wearing MY distance glasses yet ,as I thought some of my school  mates worked there.,so I put them in my bag as well.

I felt very strange being bare eyed. I got up and started to walk across towards the door. Why did everything look double?, i had never taken my glasses off outside and tried to walk about,it was very different to leaving home first thing in the morning without my glasses on until I met Martian at the bus stop.

I started to panic,then I heard Martian's voice.

“What are you doing Jenny”

“I thought i could manage without my distance glasses but everything looked double”
“That was silly,here let me put them on you” 


Shopping was going to be very difficult as I couldn't see the list on my phone and he knew I didn't want to put my reading glasses on.but Martian was very kind and read the list out for me.

“The next 9 months was very peaceful.
I knew where everything was in the house,and also I spent most of the time locked in my bedroom studying, so nobody saw me wearing glasses, and Martian waited for me just around the corner of my house now, as it was getting almost impossible to manage without wearing glasses.

I must admit that I found it exciting when Martian takes My glasses out of their case and hooks the cables over my ears.He doesn't know but I wear a panty pad now as it makes me leak a little ha.also it is such a relief to be able to see.


“Did you get the message from school today”

 I pretended I hadn't 

Martian said it was the school's fancy dress dinner and dance next week and would I come with him.

I would have loved to go with him ,but I knew without My  glasses on I wouldn't  be able to see  so I would not enjoy it.

“Thank you Martian but it's not my thing".  

Martian looked sad


"You can't fool me Jennifer,I know the real reason"

I went red

"What do you mean Martian"

"Nobody at school has seen you wearing glasses, you take them off before we reach school each morning,, we go to have lunch together, you hold my hand as we go into our classrooms ,you sit next to me,”

“That's all ok I'm not complaining"

"But be honest with me please"

I started to cry.

"I'm sorry Martian, please don't be cross with me of course I would love to go with you, but you nobody has seen me wearing glasses and I can't see much now without them,and everything is double and I get such bad headaches after a few minutes”

Martian smiled and gave me a hug


"Where are we  going Martian" 

"Wait and see "

"Why are we going in the options,I have not had a SMS yetnfor my next appointment" 

"I have the solution you go as Harry potter so you need some black Harry potter style glasses haha" 

"You mean I'm going to wear glasses to school”

“Yes dear”

“You are so clever Martian" 

"Good mornin Jennifer I was just going to send you your second reminder"

I could feel Martian staring at me,

 
"How are you Miss Jennifer,we wondered if you had move as you missed your last 2 appointments"

I Just said I had so much work to do,I didn't dare look at Martian 

After he had finished testing,he turned to me

"I'm afraid  there is a very big change in your sight again, especially your right eye Jennifer. 
"You really must keep your appointments if I give you your full prescription now it will be too big a difference to what you are wearing now so I will just give you this prescription for now”

 “Then I want to see you again in 3 months”


“Why is my right lens always so much thicker than my left lens” 

“You have a lazy left eye its called amblyopia.it should have been treated when you were younger”
“We can correct your right eye to 20/50 but your left eye we can only correct to 20/100

Martian looked at the doctor. “What treatment should Jennifer had”

“She should have had her right eye patched for a year”

“O Martian I don't want to get that done”

“Do you want the same frames again" 

"Yes but Jennifer and I are going to a fancy dress party so she is going as Harry Potter she needs  black metal frames”

“We will have to order the blanks for your lens they are out of our stock range”
“They should only take about a week to arrive.


“I think you should wear your current reading glasses all the time now they are nearer to your new distance,and maybe use a magnifying glass as extra help for reading”


It's the day of our fancy dress party at school,
Martian has gone to collect my black Harry Potter glasses.It Has been strange wearing my old  reading glasses all the time, and having to carry a magnifying glass to read my phone.


Martian gave me a big hug 


“Sit down Jennyn”

I felt Martian removing my tortoiseshell reading glasses that i had worn full time  for the last 3 weeks 
I heard the glasses case click as he opened it.
Martian hooked the cables over my ears,

“I'm scared Martian,do you really want me to wear these glasses to school”

“Yes of course I do”

“I thought you had many admirers why would you want to be seen with me wearing these glasses, I'm sure the right lens must look even uglier than before I noticed you not let me see them”

“Are you sure you want to be seen with me”

“I know lots of girls like me,but they are mostly silly and just want to smoke and drink in the woods”

“I enjoy being with you and studying together”

“I have a surprise for you, wait a minute while I put my costume on”

“Wow Martian that's so kind of you to wear fake glasses for me”

“They are not fake”

“How do you mean I have never seen you wearing glasses”

“I asked the dr for a pair of fake glasses to wear to the fancy dress, but he insisted on checking my eyes and I'm a little short sighted,so I would need glasses to pass my driving test next year, so I thought I get them now and wear them all the time like you”

“O Martian you're so thoughtful”

It was a wonderful evening, people looked at us both wearing glasses, but nobody commented on the thickness of my right lens. It could have been that Martian was always standing that side of me and it was rather dark in the hall.
Martian asked me if I was going to wear my glasses to school next week,
I said I wasn't sure, he said it was ok he would support me on what I decided.
On Monday As there was only 2 weeks  before the end of term and we wouldn't be returned I decided not to wear them.



In 6 weeks time Martian And I are starting  at the university. His father has rented and apartment for him,and he is moving in this weekend and then he is collecting me on Monday,it will feel strange living together for the first time.also we have never had an sex together.well actually I'm still a virgin.


I sent Martian a SMS. “I don't feel very well Martian I don't think you had better collect me today”

O Dear what's wrong, has your mother rang the doctor .

Hi Martian the doctor had been I have measles

Hi feeling better now can you collect me tomorrow please  I need to talk to you

"Hi Jenny you look pretty,Why have you got your reading glasses on? Have you broken your distance glasses?”

“No I'm scared,I can't see anything with them,even with these on I can't see anything clearly now,and I can't read with them now. My eyesight seems to have got so much worse since I had measles,"

"Don't worry let's go and see the eye Dr"


“Please Don't let go of me Martian”
 The Lady at the reception arranged for us to see the Dr straight away

The doctor looked very concerned as he read the printout his assistant gave him

"Did you say you have had measles"


"Yes doctor why can't I see with these glasses now and I feel dizzy and unbalanced "

"Did your mother keep the curtains drawn"

"Yes but it was difficult to see my phone to do my homework"

"Will Jennifer eyes recover Doctor"

,"Regretfully not Martian"


"I'm afraid there is a serious problem with her eyesight now"

You should  have rested and stayed in a dark room, it will take about a week to get your new glasses made.
I will make you a temporary pair of glasses until yours arrive"
"The main problem is your right eye"

Thank you Doctor .will the buzzing noise go away, I never had it until I caught measles" 


I don't know but I suggest you go up stairs to our audiologist dept"

"I will ring them and tell them you are coming up and advise them you have had measles"


After lots of tests ,the lady looked at me.

"Did you have any hearing problems before you had measles" 

,"No none"

"O dear, the problem with measles in people your age  is that it can badly affect eyesight and hearing .
But not to worry we can sort it out just wait in the room opposite there a few minutes"

As I sat down in the room I felt I wanted to cry.
Martian tried to reassure me.

"Don't worry dear i expect you have a lot of wax in your ears, I think they will just clean it out"

"Good morning Jennifer,I have not seen you here before,I will clean your ears out first"

What did she mean first?

"I see on your notes that you had measles and now ringing sound in your ears as well it's called tinnitus"

"We can help you so don't worry"


I had to go into this small room and put big headphones on and press a button when I heard a bleep. 


When I returned She leant forward and fitted these 2 gadgets into my ears and connected them to a machine.after about 10 minutes she disconnected them.

"What colour do you like"

"Pink"

Why did she want to know what colours I liked 

"If you wait in the recipient room I will call you when I ready for you"

About 20 mins later she called us back in.

My jaw dropped open,what were those 2 Blue boxes

"Just turn this way a little while I fit this over your left ear and push the plug into your ear canal"

"This one is for your left hear it will help with the tinnitus noise"
"The other aid is rather bigger as you have lost a considerable amount of hearing in your right ear"
"You can go back to our optical dept now your new glasses are ready for you"


“How long will it take to cure the noise"
"Can I take these out now please
“Do I put them in before I go to bed so I won't hear the noise,it stops me sleep”

The lady glared at me


"They will need you to keep them on while they adjust your glasses"

“Why do they want to fit them with my glasses on Martian I don't wear my glasses in bed

Martian came over and cuddled me.


“Darling what the lady is trying to tell you is that you need to wear them ALL the time”

I think I fainted.
The next thing I can remember was sitting in opticiens waiting room. 

“Hello Jennifer,
