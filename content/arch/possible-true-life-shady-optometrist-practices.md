description: "Uncover a possible scandal in the Optometry world with suspicions and investigations in this gripping story."
---
This story was inspired by the Shady Doctor post written from an Optometrist point of view. That being said the story is based on my suspicions of something happening in the Louisville Kentucky/southern Indiana area in the late 70's to early 80's. I will also reference a fine article in the National Enquirer from about 20 or so years ago. I will not name any practices as the biggest one I suspected is now under different ownership and has a better reputation now.
First the Enquirer story. Several years back a reporter for that paper was examined by an Optometrist confirming he did not need vision correction of any kind. The reporter then visited several Optometrists and at some was prescribed glasses. I don't remember what any of the practices said after the fact when asked for comment.Â  wish I had saved the paper with the story as it was interesting.
Now to what I suspect was happening. There was an Optometrist practice around here back in the 80's which a lot of people including me went to. Now as for me there was no question in my mind I needed glasses and they were indeed prescribed. The practice advertised the then popular glasses made in one hour. Several people I talked to were not impressed with how the offices operated. Looking back assembly lines are fine for making cars and such but not for getting glasses which the office theirs I went to seemed like. You would be just finished ordering glasses when they would call you to pay but that is not the problem I was suspecting. I would have liked for one of the local TV stations or the newspaper to do an investigation similar to what the Enquirer did some years before that which was in the 80's. I wish an investigative report had been done by having somebody with confirmed good vision go in for a routine checkup, I believe in these offices the person would have been prescribed glasses. It probably would have been even better if the investigation report could have got one person with good vision not needing correction for each office. I will say the Optometrist I went to was good but the glasses seemed cheap and there were not the most of least expensive meaning more of a mid range price.
In closing if somebody knows this area and tries to guess which office this was I will not confirm or deny. There is one or two practices in the area I would like to see this investigation on today.
