FINDING ME PART 6

2 days later the door light flashed ,when I opened it Jill was standing there smiling,it seemed strange to see her wearing my old blue NHS reading glasses,and she had dyed her hair blue, they seemed to suit her and the hippy clothes she was wearing she gave me a big hug and a kiss.


"My father sends his thanks,he is so pleased I can see now"
"I told my boyfriend I had got glasses and would be wearing them all the time, so we better part as I wanted somebody that would love me wearing glasses, and needed glasses themselves"

"I Don't think I introduced Annabell property yesterday day,she is my partner we are planning to get married as soon as my devorce  comes through my husband left me,but he did me a favour"  haha

We all sat down and had coffee and a cigarette,Jill had brought a blue holder with her.

Annabell placed the test chart on the wall and a chair for Jill to sit on .
"Before you take your glasses off what can you read with them on"

Jill managed 4 lines

"Ok you are very short sighted in that eye"

Annabell took the glasses off of Jill and fitted the test frames on her .
She kept adding lens then changing them until Jill could read line 6
She then changed the black lens and asked Jill what letter she could read with her right eye "

Jill Lent forwards "I think it's a E or it could be a F or maybe a T 

Annabell added different lens it wasn't long before Jill could read line 8 
She then gave Jill a card to hold after changing some lens Jill smiled as she read all the letters now on the card.

"You can put the glasses you borrowed back on for now"

,"Amber can I have your old distance glasses that you were wearing today and some sellotape"

"What you mean my myodisc glasses"

Annabell took them into the kitchen,10: minutes later she returned.

"You have a Very big difference between your 2 eyes just like Amber and I do"

"You need minus 8 with a little astigmatism for your right eye,but your left eye needs minus 27 with more astigmatism correction,which is very similar to Amber's left eye  prescription in her old distance glasses,I have blanked out the right lens as that will be much too strong for you*

"Let's try these"

Annabell placed my old pink NHS myodisc glasses on  Jill.

"O my,they are so different everything straight ahead is so Sharpe and bright but I can't see sideways as easy but they are not as heavy"
    
Annabell suggested jill go and look in the bathroom mirror,she was all smiles when she returned.

"I remember seeing Amber wearing these the first time I meet her,I love them,but I had to stand further away from the mirror why is that"

"Do you remember when I asked you to read the small print I changed the lens in the test frame"

"Yes it was all blurry at first,then you made it nice and clear,why was that"

*You have strained your eye muscles for so many years to try and see,so it's difficult for them to adjust from close to distance,so that's why you can see better further away with these glasses and better close with the blue pair Amber lent you"

O I don't know if I can afford 2 pairs.

I thought for a minute then turned to Annabell.

"If Jill can see like this could she have my old reading glasses for in the shop and these for normal use,until she can afford her own"

*If she can manage with your reading glasses in the shop"
"Then rather than this black lens I could put a minus 8 C39 lens in these for her right eye and leave your myodisc left lens in"

"It would be rather nice to see properly with both eyes but I can manage like this for now but what about the cost of these to frames how much are they"

I thought for a moment" I don't need them now so you can have them"

"You mean I don't need to pay for them*

"Yes but I'm worried the sticky tape,will come off so I will pay Annabell for putting the C39 lens in for your right eye"

"You did not charge me for the first cigarette holder,and I know what it's like to have a man controlling you"

Annabell went into our bedroom and started massaging her sister"

I could see Jill was about to cry.

" Don't cry come here let me put YOUR reading glasses  back on "

It was strange putting my old glasses back on her,
I meant to just give her a hug to comfort her but I suddenly found my tongue sliding over the plastic covering the roof of her mouth and felt the 2 metal hooks.

"I'm sorry  please don't tell Annabell"

"It's ok I liked it,you are so lucky having Annabell,I wish I had someone like that,boys are so rough,
 
"Jill went bright scarlet. Do all lesbians kiss like that so gently"

"I don't know Annabell is the only girl I have been with"
I just knew as soon as I kissed her"

"But I would be to shy to kiss like that,and I have LOTS OF FAKE TEETH I have never told any body"

"It's ok I could feel the plastic plate on the roof of your mouth with my tongue, it was still nice and you can take them out to kiss if you wanted to"

"LOOK"

"Jill GASPED"

"YOU you don't have any teeth but you still look beautiful"

"Haha thank you,when we make love we take each other teeth out as a way to excite our self's"

"You mean you both wear fake teeth"

"Haha they are called DENTURES not false teeth haha"

"I could never use that word only old people have them"

"But you are both so young am pretty I though I was the only young girl that had fake teeth I have NEVER taken them out since I first got them I was still at school then, I always just brush them in my mouth and use a mouthwash

"Haha I thought the same till Annabell took hers out,but I was too shy to take mine out so Annabell took them out the first time for me"

Annabell came in and smiled when she saw me holding my dentures. She came over and took hers out,Jill looked as we kissed each other.

,"You see there's nothing to be ashamed about"

*Come over here were the light is better and let Amber take yours out for you"

I looked close at her mouth. I could only see the one front discoloured tooth the rest looked like on a partial denture.

"He said he was going to put some fake teeth to replace the ones he was taking out so I think I still have some real teeth I couldn't eat or talk for months with all that plastic in my mouth,I was to scared to take them out incase I couldn't get them back in and I didn't want to see myself with missing teeth"

Annabell  moved the light so I could see better,
There were 2 metal hooks at the back,they were hooked around two badly decayed teeth and I could see the only other tooth she had,It was the discoloured front tooth,I gently released the hooks from the back teeth and lifted the denture out,her gums looked red and badly infected. The bottom also had 2 hooks on them near the back.

"You had better come into the bathroom with me I will put your dentures in to soak and we have some antiseptic mouthwash to rinse your mouth out"
"Do you know why they kept just one front tooth and the 2 back teeth"

Jill did not know as she had never seen herself without her false teeth in,I had to admit that only having one rather large discoloured tooth at the front seemed strange,you could see a lot of decay at the side on the tooth which had been hidden by her dentures

She watched as I put her dentures in to soak 
Then I got our denture bath and put Annabell and mine in.
She was staring at them." How do you know which are your and which  are Annabell's"

I laughed, "we don't it's first come first served haha it's only when we eat if the top ones feel loose I know they are Annabell's so we swop then ha*

"Let's go into the garden and have some soup and a smoke"

"WHAT ABOUT MY FAKE TEETH"

"What did you call them"

"FAk ooo DE.um dentur"

"dentures"

I smiled "You see that was better ha"

"It's ok just we will leave them to soak Annabell and I often go toothless. The cigarettes taste nicer without the plastic in your mouth."You have a lovely private garden,I feel comfortable here,thank you for inviting me, it's strange not having all that plastic in my mouth, It's hard to talk,but the soup has a lovely flavour and the cigarette has a much stronger taste"

"What time should I go I don't want to outstay my welcome"

*Annabelle's sister is bringing you a prescription lens to fit in your distance  glasses instead of the black disc you have in now,she is still working so you can have a meal tonight with us,and if you would like to stay the night"

"Yes please that would be very nice":

"When can I put my Fals ops dentures back in"

"In the morning after breakfast,they need to soak overnight they are very badly stained,you must be a heavy smoker,"


“Yes, life was very stressful with my boyfriend. Most days I smoke at least 30 of the strongest filter free we sell.i need to feel the unfiltered nicotine hitting my lungs. I'm so addicted now that I need a cigarette in bed as soon as I wake.
 
 Judy Arrived and quickly warmed my old glasses frames which Jill was now going to wear all the time.
The right myodisc lens easily popped out and Judy put the C39 lens in,I had not realised it would not have a small myodisc circle in it.
I thought it looked rather strange on having a circle in one lens 

Annabell explained  that myodisc lens only started above minus 12 And ,Jill was only minus 8 with10 out prisms in that eye.

I showed Jill the glasses,she smiled. I had to admit she would have looked prettier toothless than with that one big yellowing tooth right at the front of her mouth.

"Will you put them on for me please"
"They are fantastic ,I didn't realise my right eye was so bad I think it was just my left"
"Can I see what they look like please"

So I took her into the bathroom
Jill asked "why is my right lens normal but I'm looking through a small circle in the lens lens,I don't mind I can see wonderfully well"

"Will you hold my hand please I want to see what I look like without my fake teeth o ok dentures ha

Annabell's sister called,"Food is ready, I've got the wine,Did you find some old hearing I could try Amber,you promised you would"

Jill looked surprised."Are you deaf as well *

"I don't know but Annabell only got hers yesterday,so I thought it would be cool to try to see if I needed them haha"

"Do you have 2 spare pairs Jill wants to try them as well ha"

"NO I DON'T,taking my false teeth out is enough for one day ha"

I found 2 marching pairs that still worked ok and put temporary ear plugs on them"

Judy Was all excited and I warned her what I was going to do.

,"O wowwwww that's so cool I never knew birds sang so load and I can hear the crickets in the field*

"Come on Amber put the other pair in for Jill"

"Do you want to try them Jill"

"I don't know but if Judy wants me to then I suppose it's ok"

"Yes please maybe we Both need them,that would be cool haha"

I put them in gently ,I think Jill wanted me to kiss her but there were too many people ,as I turned them on Jill  looked shocked and started to cry.

"I can hear the birds singing right over there in the trees and all your voices are so much clearer now"

We spent the rest of the evening drinking and smoking

Annabelle and I are going to bed now,I have made the spare bed up for you Jill and can you manage in Lynda's bed,Judy 

Annabell had brought some new magazines to read in bed and suggested I try my new reading glasses,I was rather shy but Annabell insisted.
She took my distance glasses off and hooked the cable temples of my blue NHS glasses behind my ears.i love her touching my hearing aids.

She said I looked pretty and she loved me and said "look up I want to see you"

My mouth dropped open,

Annabelle  had made herself a matching pair of blue NHS glasses and with cable temples and a blacked out left lens haha .

We did not read the magazines that night hahaha I think the magazines were only a reason to get me to put my reading glasses on haha 

I woke first and decided to go to the bathroom on my way to the kitchen as I passed the spare bedroom I could hear Judy and Jill giggling,I thought I would change the water in Jill's denture bath but I noticed it had clean water in it and there was a second pair of partial denture in it they looked very new now I know whyJudy was eating so slow..

I filled the kettle and  went outside a lit myself the first cigarette of the day. The first hit of the day is always the best as it reaches my lungs.

I had just finished laying the table for breakfast when  Judy and Jill came in holding hands 
"We both want to keep the hearing aids please we can hear so much better can Annabelle decorate them for us and we are getting our hairs cut short"

"O and we forgot to say we are moving in together"

The end 

I LOVE THE NEW ME A DEAF PARTIALLY SIGHTED 
CHAIN SMOKING LESBIAN HA
