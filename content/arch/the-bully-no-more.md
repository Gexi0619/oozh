The Bully, â€“---------no more!

A requested story.


My name is Andy, I am sure looking forward to the fall, when I will be going to high school.
I am big, for my age, I am very good looking, have nice hair, love sports, and do a lot of body building, and I know, for sure, I will be good enough, to play, on the high school football team.
I have a few so called, friends, but not any close ones.'


About 4 weeks, before high school was to start, I received an invitation, to try out, for a position on the football team.
I can hardly wait, to show the coaches, how good I am, and I am certain, I will make the team.


All the try out candidates, gathered in the gym.
I glanced around, there certainly are not any better developed bodies, then mine.
We were all interviewed by the coaching staff, who were looking at our size, and body development, and experience, if any.
After wards we went to the football field, where we were to show how well we could throw and receive the football.
Next, we had to run, and we were checked for speed.
At the end of the session, we gathered in the gym, and they called the names of the candidates, who were expected to attend, the first official team practice.
As I had expected, I was invited, to come back the next day, to start training.


School has started, and soon all the students know, who the players on the football team are, and a lot of the girls, started to flirt with them, to get their attention.
Since, I am so good looking, and a member of the football team, I soon had a lot them flirting with me.
Amy, got my eye, a blonde haired girl, with a nice developing figure and beautiful blue eyes. 
After talking to her a few times, we became more friendly, when I invited her, to be my partner at the school dance, at the end, of next week, she became all excited, and told me she would love to.
The following Monday, Amy came to school wearing glasses.
Amy, seemed very proud of her new glasses, when she asked me if I liked her new glasses, I told her that, I hate the looks of glasses, did not like girls who wore glasses, and I canceled our date.
I think she was close to tears, when she walked away from me, and she never spoke to me again.
She must have told all the girls who wore glasses, to avoid me, because they sure did.


Most members of our team, are reasonably, well developed.
After a game, when all of us were having a shower, I could not help myself, but look at all those bodies.
I now realize, my body looks as good, if mot better than most.
On thing, while showering that I really, noticed, and bothered me was, when I realized, how well endowed some of the smaller guys were, looking at the size of their their privates, I now felt ashamed to be seen, and wondered why my privates are so small, compared to what I have seen..
I became more private, after that, afraid of any nasty comments, about my size.


I am the utility player, on our team, and I am being asked to play many different positions, my biggest surprise came, when late in the fourth quarter, of an important game, the coach asked me to take over from, the regular quarterback.
I threw some good passes, and we managed to score some more points.
After the game, the coach told me, I am glad we have a back up quarterback now.


My schoolwork, was not as good, as my football playing, but my dad, did not mind, he was proud of me.
At school, I was not well liked, a lot of students, thought I was a bully, and I certainly noticed, that I was not very popular with the girls anymore.
At our school dances, I had very few partners, and most of the time, when I asked a girl for a dance, I was rejected.
I was sure, that would change, when I am the full time quarterback, next year, I will show them.
My mother complained to me, about my marks at school, and told me again, if I did not get better marks, I will never, have a chance to be drafted by a college.


The following year, we did not have as good a team, and if our performance, did not improve, we might not make the play offs. 
I did not make things any better, when I blasted a receiver, for not catching the balls, I threw him, I was sure they were perfect passes, and he should have caught them.
He quit, which, I know was my fault, and the team, sure missed him.
We had to win today, or we are out., 
I played as hard as I could, and took some awful chances, and as a result, ended up badly injured.
After a lonely stay, in the hospital, my body, had healed pretty well, but my vision was still very bad.
I was transferred to the university, opthalmology department, for evaluation.
After a series of tests, I was prescribed glasses.
Me, wearing glasses, I hated the thought, but also realize, if I wanted to see, I had no choice but to wear the glasses.
When, I got my glasses, and put them on, could not believe, how ugly, I looked.
The lenses were very thick, and I looked bug eyed.
I was told the prescription was, + 5.50. , if I wanted to see. I had no other choice, then to wear the stupid glasses.
I hated to return to the high school, to finish my graduation year, wearing glasses, but had no other choice.
The number of nasty remarks I got, from the girls, most of all, was unbelievable.
I guess, I deserved it, I never had been nice, or complimentary, to anybody wearing glasses.
I am a nobody now, no friends, nobody likes me
I had a hard time, getting used to wearing my glasses, and being able to see properly, but I managed to graduate from high school.
Losing my chance for a college scholarship, when I got injured, did not leave me much choice, 
I could not afford to go to University, so what to do?
When you are depressed, food, and eating is an escape, and of course my music, I like playing the clarinet, but what I am really doing, right now, is feeling sorry for myself, and getting lazy.


A short time later, my mother, told me to get out of the house, and find a job, so I can pay her some board money, she cannot afford to feed me, the way I have been eating lately.
There are not that many jobs available, if you don t have a trade, or an educational degree.
I ended up working in a warehouse, to move merchandise, unloading, and loading trucks. 
Being a job that created a lot of dust, my glasses were always dirty, which sure did not improve my vision.


About 6 months later, management, because of increased business, hired another man.
Jim, is a little older than I am, he is friendly guy, but there is something scary, about him, that I cannot figure out.
The way he looks at me sometimes, as if he is looking through me, or puts a spell on me.
He gives me the jitters.
Like him, or not, I had to work with him.
About a month after Jim, had started to work with me, I noticed my hair thinning, and falling out, and a bald spot, on the back of my head.
Am I going bald? I was always so proud of my nice head of hair, I don t want to go bald, bald and wearing thick glasses, how bad can it get.
When you get depressed, you try to eat your troubles away, and I did.
I got, fat and flabby, and now am losing my hair faster, and my hair is now so thin, you can see
more skin, than hair on the top my head.


On the weekends, I play the clarinet, in a small band.
We play at different, locations around town.
I make a bit of money playing with the band, and it gives me something to do.
I have given up on women, they don t seem to like me, and I am past worrying about it, I can do without them.
I know, I am no price package, with my looks, wearing thick glasses, bald, and growing fat, nobody wants or likes me any more.


This all changed, when, we were playing one night, at a dance, and I received a note.
I read it, and it said, I would like to buy you a drink, when you have your break, wave the note, and I will meet you.
At our next intermission, I walked off the stage, waving the note.
A well build, guy with a big friendly smile, walked over to me.
Hello, Andy, what would you like to drink?
A beer, will be just fine thank you, he waived to the waiter for service.
My table is right here, please sit down, and when we sat down, the waiter was there and took our order.
Andy, my name is Bill, I have watched you play here before, and always wanted to meet you.
I would love you to be my friend.
Loving, to be his friend, what does he mean, I can not remember anybody before, asking me to be their friend.
Well, he looked good, was friendly, I kind of like him, and I sure can use a friend.
Bill was waiting for me, after we finished playing, and bought me another drink, and we made plans to go out together.


Bill, and I, have been out a few times, and are now becoming real friends, 
One night we went to see a movie.
During the movie, Bill put his hand on my thigh. and I could feel his fingers slowly, going toward my private parts. when his fingers, found my member, it responded, and he played with it.
I never had, something like this, happen to me before, I liked the way I started to feel, and liked it well enough, that, I did not want Bill to stop.
After, I reached my climax, Bill took my hand, and put it on his private part,.
I now realized, he expected me to do the same to him.
When Bill reached his climax, he hugged and kissed me, and said, I am so glad you are my real friend now.
That night at home, I was thinking about what had happened, during the movie.
That was the first time, anybody touched my privates, and came to the conclusion that I had liked the whole experience, am I gay?
Well, if I am, so be it, I enjoyed the experience, and if that is what Bill likes, is fine with me, I like 
Bill very much, I enjoyed the new experience.


The next time I got together with Bill, I asked him, why he had wanted to meet me.
Bill said, I have a weakness for strong eye glasses, and bald heads, and would like to wear glasses myself, and yes, I think, I need to wear glasses, but I am scared of an eye exam, I don t want them to hurt my eyes.
Well if you should be wearing glasses, why not get them, an eye exam, is painless.
Andy, would you mind me wearing glasses?
No, the days I hated glasses, are past history.


The next time Bill and I got together, he was wearing glasses, and I thought, he looked really good.
I never thought, I would ever do it, but I told Bill, he looked very handsome wearing glasses.
He was so happy, he kissed me and said, I love wearing the glasses, and I am so happy you like them.


A short time later we moved in together, and now, we are a happy couple.
I wonder what has happened to me? 
Did someone put a spell on me?
I lost my nice hair, my perfect body became fat and flabby. 
I, like my friends new glasses, am now know I am gay.
Well so what, at least, I am happy at last,
