We want to wear strong myopic lenses


I am growing up with two older sisters, Ashley, who is 11 years old, Katie, who is 9, 
and I am Daniel, I just turned 8.
During the summer, I play a lot of soccer, and baseball, with the guys in my neighbourhood.
In the winter I like playing video games with my friend Jimmie.
My sisters are very nice to me, we like playing board games, and I am getting pretty good.
Our parents, both wear glasses, the lenses in my mom’s glasses, are stronger than my dad’s, I like 
the look of my mom’s glasses.
Ashley, wears glasses, she started wearing them, a couple of years ago, she likes wearing them, and I think she looks very pretty.
We are all due for an eye exam, before we go back to school.
I have had regular eye exams, so I know what is going on, and always wonder what the doctor sees, when he looks in my eyes with a bright lite., I think, this time, I am going to ask him.


Before we know it, it is time for our eye exam.
When we walk into the optical store, all of us go to the different racks, and have fun trying the frames, to see what we look like.
I like my look, wearing glasses, and can’t wait to get my own glasses, with nice looking lenses like my mother..
Ashley, is always the first, to get her exam, while Katie and I wait, and have fun.
As mom had expected, Ashley had an increase in her prescription, was soon busy selecting a new frame, while Katie had her eye exam.
Katie was carrying her prescription when she came out of the examination room.
My mother was not really surprised, that Katie was told she had to wear glasses, I think she expected all of us to inherit, her poor vision.
When I was in the examination room, asked the doctor what he could see, when he looked in my eyes.
He told me, he was checking the health of my eyes, and see that I not have diabetes, or any other diseases.
When you are asked to read the letters, lets me know, how well you can see.
So I learned a lot during this exam, and when he finished, the doctor told me, just what I had expected, that I don’t need to wear glasses.


When we came home, the girls were all excited about their new glasses, and I felt left out, why them, and not me.
A little later, I went to the girls bedroom, where they were admiring their new glasses.
and asked them, if they could tell me what they did to their eyes, so they could wear glasses?
They laughed, we did not do anything, it just happened.
Why, do you want to wear glasses?
I sure do,
Here you can have these, but don’t tell mom, and Ashley, gave me her old glasses.
Thanks, and I took the glasses to my room.
The glasses, Ashley gave me were not her first, but her second pair, and when I put them on, were a little strong, and I could not see to well.
I like reading, and when I wore the glasses had a hard time reading, but I liked the feel of the glasses on my face, and kept on reading.
I wore the glasses as often as I could, and before to long, could see reasonably well when wearing the
glasses, and after a while, I noticed my vision was not as good, when I was not wearing the glasses.
At school, I noticed it is now more difficult to read what is written on the black board.
Now I am sure I will be told that I have to wear glasses., at our next eye exam.
My marks at the end of the school year were down, and when my parents asked me why.
I told them that, I have a hard time reading what is on the black board.
My mother said, why did you not tell me?
I don’t know, I did not think it was important.
Well I am making an appointment for an eye exam for you right now.
The day of the eye exam, the appointment was for the afternoon.
I spend the whole morning in my room, wearing my glasses, and now when I look out of the window, can only see things far away, nice and clear, when wearing the glasses.
When we walked into the optical store in the afternoon, I was very excited, I am sure I will be told I now have to wear glasses.


The exam went well, and I heard a lot of clicks, when the doctor asked me, which is it better now?
When finished, the doctor told me that I have a strong prescription, for a first time glasses wearer,
and cannot figure out why my vision chad hanged that fast.
After I handed my prescription to the optician, I heard her tell my mother, that my prescription is almost as strong as Ashley’ s prescription.
I loved the frame I selected, and can’t wait to start wearing my new glasses when they are ready. 


Wow, after I put them on, my vision was crystal clear, and I loved the way I look. 
When I came home wearing my new glasses, everybody thought I looked very handsome.
All I want now, is to get stronger glasses, where my eyes look smaller, and the lenses show a lot of depth, and a lot of rings, like my mother’s


I am now in my second year of high school, and my glasses prescription reads, -3.75 for the right and -4.00 for the left eye.
I now wear stronger glasses than Ashley, and I want them even stronger.
There is a girl in my class, who wears much stronger myopic glasses than I do.
Her name is Cindy, I sure like to get to know her better.
The opportunity came when we had a school dance. 
My sisters had taught me how to dance, and I enjoy dancing.
I asked Cindy for a dance, she was a good dancer, and commented on how well I danced.
So we had a lot of dances together, which gave me the opportunity to ask her, if I could buy her a drink, so I can sit and talk to her.
When we were seated having a drink, told her how nice she looked wearing glasses, she thanked me and told me she likes wearing glasses.
I told her I loved the looks of her lenses, and if she knew how strong her prescription was.
Cindy, told me that at her last eye exam, her right eye was now – 7.25, and her left – 7.50, and that she is due for an other eye exam, in a few weeks, and expects a big increase, and I hope I do, I love the I look of wearing glasses with strong lenses.
Both her parents are myopic, and their prescriptions, are about – 18.00, my older sister wears -12.00 glasses.
We danced some more and I can’t believe I found a girl, who likes me, and who like me, loves to wear strong glasses.
I told her I want to wear stronger glasses to, and she told me, that perhaps she can help me, she would love to see me wear stronger glasses.
After the dance, I walked her home, and she let me kiss her, what a night.
Cindy and I are going to see a movie Saturday afternoon.


I met Cindy at her place, and we took the bus to the mall.
Cindy mentioned I have a little surprise for you, so I asked her what is it? 
You will have to wait till we are sitting down in the theatre.
When we were seated, Cindy put her hand in her purse, and pulled out a couple of glasses cases ,
she handed me the first one, told me the glasses in this case, if I remember right, about – 5.00,
and the other about -6.00
I put on the – 6.00 glasses and looked at her, Cindy gave me a kiss, I love your new look
When the movie started I tried both pair of glasses, and I was able to see reasonably well, wearing
the -5.00 glasses, so I wore them.
Cindy also changed glasses, and told me she now wears her sisters old-10.00 glasses.
When I looked at her, she looked fantastic and told her I love the way you look.
We wore the glasses during the movie, and I was surprised that I was so comfortable wearing them.
After the movie, we kept on wearing the glasses, while sitting at the food court, enjoying our refreshments, and enjoyed looking at each other.
Cindy, suggested, I should keep the -6.00 glasses, so I could wear them, and when I could see well with the -5.00 glasses, I am quite sure you can induce some more myopia that way.
Cindy and I both, always wear black framed glasses, so the only way you could notice they were not our regular glasses, was by the looks of the lenses.
Both of us, whenever we get a chance, wear the stronger prescriptions, and I have no problem now seeing perfectly, wearing the -5.00 prescription.
The -6.00, glasses were not to hard to get used to, I guess at my age, it is most likely easier to force your vision to change.
A little over a month later, I certainly could see very well, when wearing the -6.00 glasses.
Cindy suggested I wear the -6.00 now, and not push it anymore until after my next eye exam, in about a month.
Cindy, now has perfect vision now, wearing the -10.00 prescription, and is waiting for her sister’s eye exam, to see if she has another increase, then she has another pair of glasses to wear.
We now have finished our last year of high school, and at the end of the summer, both Cindy and I are due for our yearly eye exam. 
To our surprise, Cindy’s sister, did not have an increase in her prescription, and no stronger glasses for Cindy, to try to induce more myopia.
At the end of the summer, Cindy’s prescription went up to less then -10.00 and she was very disappointed.
At my eye exam, I managed to get up to -6.00, and if I want to go for a higher prescription, will only have Cindy’s -7.50 glasses available.
Because Cindy and I are now going to different colleges, I have decided to let nature give me more increases.
Cindy, wants to be an optician, I am taking a business course.


Cindy, now studying to be an optician, was taught how to grind lenses, and with help from her teacher, 
made herself a new pair of -12.00 glasses, which she was wearing when we had our Christmas break.
She looked fantastic, and now I am using her -7.50 glasses., so we can keep on trying, we very happy with our results so far.
All our efforts came to an unexpected end, when at Cindy’s next exam, the optometrist, referred her to an ophthalmologist, because Cindy had been seeing floaters, and the optometrist was concerned about about the possibility of a torn retina.
Neither of us wanted to lose our sight, and possible eye surgery, and we will have to be happy, with our current prescription.
We both like the looks of our present prescription lenses, and will have to be satisfied, with what we have, and see, what happens, at our next eye exam, time will tell.
