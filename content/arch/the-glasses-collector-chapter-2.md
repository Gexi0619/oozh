The collector chapter 2




I have moved, and now, I am living over an antique store, and like to browse around,
in the store, and wonder how people must have lived.
Now, I appreciate, the many conveniences, we have to day.




June and I get along well, and enjoy each others company, and I am glad I have moved in with her, 
it saves her from being lonely, and we enjoy having our meals together.
I like the short walk to my work, and breathing in some fresh air.




I have a real good day, to day, 
We were busy this morning, and I sold some designer eyeglasses frames, which is important, because the manufacturer,
will give you a free frame, with your proper prescription, when you have sold, ten of their frames.
I like, to be a the nice looking, glasses wearing girl, and would love, wearing one of those frames.
Now, it is time, to go and have my lunch.
Right around the corner, is my favourite place, a small, family restaurant, that serves excellent food.




I must be here, at the wrong time to day, because the restaurant, is very busy.
But, I am lucky, somebody, just left, and I have a nice window seat, at a small table.
While enjoying, my sandwich, and looking outside, noticed, a young man standing beside my table.
Would you mind, if I sit with you? It is the only seat available.
Being polite, I told him, he could take the seat.
After he sat down, I had a good look at him, and remember, seeing him here before.




I have seen you here before, do you work at the optical store?
Yes, I do, I started there, about a month ago.
I am Ken Roberts, I work at the Insurance office,
Glad to meet you, my name is Cindy.
Ken, is a well groomed, good looking guy, with a nice head of dark hair.
We had a pleasant conversation, about the kind of work we do, and before I knew it,
I had to get back to work.




At the apartment that night, we talked about our day, and had an enjoyable evening.




The next week, while I was having my lunch, Ken joined me again.
After some chit chat, he mentioned, how he liked, looking at my glasses..
I am fascinated, the way your lenses, showing some rings, and feature your eyes.
You look so nice, wearing glasses.
Thank you Ken, I like wearing glasses, and feel good wearing them, and the way wearing glasses, make me look.
I am not familiar with glasses, nobody in my family wears them., and I never realized, 
how nice a person can look wearing glasses.




That night, I mentioned to June, meeting Ken, and our conversation.
He did not ask you for a date?
No, perhaps he will, I think, he is a little shy.
Well, Jimmy came around again to day, and asked me to go out with him, so I have a date.




The next time, Ken, asked me for a date, and we went to see a movie.
Wearing my glasses, which gives me perfect vision, I do not like to sit, close to the front, but we did.
After a pleasant evening, we made another date.




To day, Ken met me at the restaurant, for lunch.
During our meal, Ken mentioned, he had to leave early, because he wanted to go. 
to the license office, to get his drivers license renewed.




Later in the day, he walked into the optical store, and told me, that he had not pass the vision test,.
Well that is easy, we will make an appointment, for you to have an eye exam.
Cindy, I can see just fine, I don’t want to wear glasses.
Ken, you need to wear glasses, they don’t hurt, and I know, you will look very handsome.
Come with me, and I will show you.
Ken followed me to the display rack, and I had him try some frames, and look at himself.
Yes, Cindy, you are right, I think, I might like my glasses wearing look, 
you can make an appointment for me.




Ken, is myopic, and now wears glasses, and I think, looks very handsome wearing glasses.
He received, at his work, many compliments, on his new look, and I can tell, he now, likes to wear his glasses.
The next time, we went on a date, to see a movie, we sat further away,
Ken kept on telling me, how fantastic the glasses are, and how well he can see now.




June and I decided, that we should have our boyfriends, over for dinner and drinks.
The following Saturday, when we were together, it was not hard to tell, that both guys liked our glasses wearing look.
After a lot of questions, and trying our glasses, told us, how they just loved our glasses wearing look.






I am sure, Ken is getting the glasses fetish.
He now comes, to the optical store regularly, to try frames, and has asked me, 
if their is a way to become more myopic, he loves the looks, of higher prescription glasses.
I told him to let me see, what I could do to .




I love to wear June’s old glasses, but the only way, I can do that, is wearing glasses over contacts.
After figuring out the proper combination, I am going to give it a try.
I have a lot of contact lenses available, at work, and found some with the right prescription.




To night, after we had eaten, I excused myself, and went to the bathroom, to put the contact lenses in.
I put on June’s old – 20.00 glasses, and looked at myself in the mirror, and had never realized,
that me wearing glasses, with that high a prescription, would make me feel so sexy.
The tiny looking eyes, and the strong lenses, I sure liked wearing the high myopic glasses.
It was a challenge to walk, wearing the glasses, everything smaller and further away.
But, I managed to walk into the living area,.
When June saw me wearing her old glasses, wondered how I could possibly wear them, and see properly.
After I told her what, I had done, walked slowly around the room.
What an experience, I loved it.
I did my g.o.c. for the next few nights, and now feel more confident doing it.




I wore the strong glasses, going shopping with June, and had many people looking, at the two blind girls.
What a pleasant experience, to walk down the street, and looking around.




The next time, that I had a date, with Ken, I did my g.o.c.
When Ken came, and saw me wearing the strong prescription glasses, wondered what had happened to me.
I explained, what I was doing.
I love that look, can I do that to? 
Yes, but we will have to get you, the right prescription glasses first.
How, are you going to do that ?
Well, I have to see, if I have, a suitable pair of glasses, for you to wear in my collection.
You have a collection?
Yes, I now have almost a hundred pair of glasses, and I am sure, I might have a good looking,
high prescription, pair of glasses, for you to wear.
Cindy, when can I see the glasses?
The next time you come, but first you will have to come to the optical store, 
so I can get you fitted, with the proper size contact lenses.
I will have to teach you,, how to put the lenses in, and how to take the lenses, out of your eyes.


It did not take Ken long, to be able, to insert, and remove the contact lenses.
I gave him a pair of lenses, in his prescription to wear, to get used to wearing the contacts.




Ken, could not believe his eyes, when he saw all the glasses, I had in my collection.
He was like a kid, in a candy store, trying some of the glasses.
At last we found a pair of -16.00 glasses, with a frame, that Ken liked to wear.
Now, he cannot wait, to do the glasses over contacts.
Ken, you will have to wait, till the weekend, then we have all day.




After , Ken put his contact lenses in, and the -16.00 glasses on, loved the new experience.
I wore my – 20.00 glasses, and we slowly walked around the apartment.
Ken , turned around, and kissed me, and told me, that wearing the strong glasses, made him feel very sexy.
Just calm down, you cannot have sex with me, till I have a ring on my finger.
Ken laughed, great, put your hand in my pocket, and you will find one.




I now wear a ring on my finger, and yes, we had a fantastic weekend.
I am so glad, I have all those glasses in my collection, and the result they brought me.
How lucky, that I am to became a glasses collector.
