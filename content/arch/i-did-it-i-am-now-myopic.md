description: "Mike, the only one in his family without glasses, discovers a solution to induce myopia with contact lenses."
---
I feel left out !!
Both my parents wear glasses.
My 2 younger sisters wear glasses,
The whole family wears glasses for myopia, except me ,
I love the looks of glasses with myopic lenses.
Seeing the mimification , does something to me 
I would like to be told at my next annual eye exam, that I need to wear glasses., bu so far no luck.

Sorry I forgot to tell you, my name is Mike.
I just finished high school, and after summer vacation , I am going to college.
To morrow I have my yearly appointment for an eye exam.
I am not excited , I am pretty sure the optometrist will tell me again that I don t need glasses.

When I walked into the optical store for n my exam, was greeted by a very pretty glasses wearing lady.
She told me her name is Sandy, I am the optician.
She mentioned the doctor was running behind schedule , and while I was waiting  she could show me some new frames.
She handed me a few frames that she thought would look very nice on me.
I tried some of the frames and she commented how good I look wearing glasses.
I mentioned to her that I would love to wear glasses, but that after every eye exam I am told my eyes are healthy and I don t need glasses.
While we talked some more , she told me that she had started to wear glasses in grade four, and always loved wearing glasses so much,
that she became an optician.
We were interrupted in our conversation , when the doctor told me he was ready to see me.
The exam went as expected, no glasses.
I must have looked pretty sad when I came out of the examination room.
Sandy the optician, who was not busy at the time, came over and told me she had a suggestion.
She asked me if I knew about induced myopia 
I told her I had heard of it, but did not know how to go about it.
She suggested I come in the next day, first thing in the morning, and she might have a sollution.

When I went into the optical store the next day, Sandy was waiting for me.
She told me she was not busy, because the doctor would not be in this morning.
She asked me to come with her.
We went into a small room with some optical equipment.
This is the room where I fit patients with contact lenses.
I can fit you with contact lenses, and when you wear them all the time you might induce myopia.
She then asked me if I would like to try it.
I told her to go ahead , I was all for it.
She checked me for the proper lens size.
She inserted the lenses , and asked me to read the letters on the chart, when I had no trouble reading them, she inserted stronger lenses.
The letters looked a little fuzzy.
I looked around and noticed everything fuzzy and a little further away, I liked that feeling.
Sandy suggested I wear the lenses for a month , and then come back and see her.
After a lesson about inserting and removing the contact lenses, and how to care for them , she told me to give her a call 
in about a month to let her know how I was getting along.
After paying her for a month supply of lenses and the cleaning solution, I went home.
When I walked out of the store and looked down the street was surprised how well I could see.
What a wonderful feeling .
When I removed the lenses going to bed , noticed everything in the distance looked a little fuzzy.
It did not take me long to feel comfortable when wearing the lenses all day, and could see very well when attending lectures, 
sitting in the back of the room
I soon noticed I needed to wear the contact lenses to see properly.
I called Sandy at the end of the month and arranged for an appointment .
She told me the lenses I had been wearing were -0.75.
, and she suggested we try - 1.50.and see how I would get along wearing them.
Walking out of the optical store wearing the stronger lenses , noticed quite a difference in my vision.
About a week later my brain started to like my new lenses and I could see quite well.
I now sure noticed a big difference in my vision when I took the lenses out.
By the time I was ready for my next exam , I was wearing - 2.25 lenses.


When the day of my eye exam came I was wearing my - 2.25 lenses to the optical store.
Just before the eye exam, I went to the washroom and removed my contact lenses.
When I went into the examination room my vision was blurry.When the optometrist  looked at the print out of the auto refractor,
mentioned to me , your vision seemed to have changed quite a bit, let s have a good look.
After the exam was finished and he handed me my prescription , you are now myopic like the rest of the family.
When I looked at my prescription it read - 2.25 for the right and - 2.00 for the left eye , and a little bit of astigmatism.
I did it , I am going to wear glasses now.
With a big smile on my face , I handed Sandy my prescription.
Together  we selected a frame that looked great.
Sandy took the proprer measurements , and told me to glasses would be ready later in the day.


End of part one the good part comes next.
