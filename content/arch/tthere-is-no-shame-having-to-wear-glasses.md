description: "Amy's journey from curiosity to embracing glasses as a symbol of self-expression and identity."
---
Amy s father is a lawyer, her mother a perfectionist, every thing has to be perfect and the very best., including her children.
Amy was always kept busy with either dancing lessons , a self improvement course, and sometimes she did some modeling at local fashion shows, which she enjoyed very much.
She was in her second year of high school, and developing into a beautiful young woman.
Amy s best friend is Ashley, they have been friends since grade 3.
They are both good students and like spending a lot of time together.

The next day, when the girls went to  school, Ashley told Amy that her mother had made an appointment for her to have an eye exam.She thinks I have a vision problem.
I don t think I have, and I am a bit scared, I need some moral support , will you come with me ?
Amy agreed, this might be an interesting experience, she did not know anything about glasses or vision problems.and this might be a good way to learn something about that.

They went for Ashley s eye exam and walked into the optical store.
This was the first time Amy had been in an optical store.
When Ashley had her exam , she looked around and was very impressed with the large selection of glasses frames available.
Being familiar with fashion , was impressed by all the different styles and colors avail;able.
While Amy looked at all the frames , the optician told her she was welcome to try any of them , so she could see what she would look like wearing glasses.
Amy then tried a number of frames, this was fun.
She was surprised how good he looked wearing some of the frames ,, she liked that , and noticed that there seemed to be something exciting about glasses.

When Ashley s exam was finished and she came back into the store, went to Amy, I have to wear glasses for seeing far away, they call it myopia.
Please will you help me  and find a nice frame.
After trying many different frames and a lot of laughter, they decided on a real smart looking plastic frame.

They went to the mall for some refreshments.
Amy told Ashley , that while she had her exam, she had tried  lot of different frames, it was exciting , I liked the the way I looked wearing some of the glasses, and I am a kind of sorry I don t need them.

When they went back to pick up Ashley s glasses and she put them on , said I think my mother was     right , I do need to wear glasses.
I can see so much better now and everything is nice and clear.
When she looked at herself in the mirror said, I love the way  I look , I never looked this good before.
Now I am glad I have to wear glasses.

They went to Amy s place, and after Amy s mother greeted them, looked shocked seeing Ashley wear glasses, but did not say a word.
When the were in Amy s bedroom , Amy had to try Ashley s glasses. When she put then on was surprised how well she could see wearing them.
They are a little fuzzy but I  can see pretty good .

After Ashley went home , Amy s mother said I feel sorry for  the poor girl.
I am glad you don t need glasses , I would not let you wear them, they show imperfection.
I would have you wear contacts or have an operation.
Dad wears glasses.
That is part of his job, and he only wears them at the office.
Amy was very surprised about her mothers reaction.
She liked the looks of glasses and would not mind needing to wear them.

About 6 months later , Ashley was due for a routine eye exam
The optometrist was very surprised about the increase in her prescription.
Her right eye went from - 0.75 to -1.25 and her left eye from -0.75 to -1.00. and a bit of astigmatism.
So Ashley got herself a new pair of glasses.
When Amy saw her , told her she liked her new glasses even better and that she looked great.
Ashley told her that her glasses were stronger now, but I can see so much better.
Amy said I envy you , I would not mind having to wear glasses, I love the look of them
Here you can have my old ones, then  you have glasses to.
Amy said I like that, took the glasses and put them on.
Then she looked around and said , when I tried these glasses when you first got them , everything looked a bit fuzzy, now I can see everything nice and clear, they are perfect
I am going to wear them now .but won  t let my mother know.
Amy started to wear the glasses at school and noticed an improvement in he vision, and soon wore them all day.
She had to remember when she left school to take her glasses off and put them in her bag.

It was early sprig , and her Dad told her that he thought it was time for her to learn to drive., and apply for her beginners permit.

So the next day her mother drove her to the office to get her permit.
After the paper work came the eye test, which she failed, and she was told to come back after she had an eye exam
Her mother who was waiting for her ,told the examiner he was wrong, everything about my daughter is perfect.
The examiner said I agree, except for her vision.
On the way home her mother was very upset , she did not want her daughter to war glasses.
Not having any other choice, arrangements were made for an eye exam
