The IdenticalTwins




Amy, and I, Ashley are identical twins, we look alike, and we both, are very proud of our hair and looks,
It is easy to tell us apart, because I wear glasses, and Amy does not.
We, both had regular eye exams, and I started to wear glasses, in grade 3, when I could not read the writing on the blackboard.
Amy, never was prescribed to wear glasses, just as well, she tells me, she hates the thoughts of having to wear glasses.
I have told her many times, wearing glasses is no trouble, and have benefits, beside improved vision,
I don’t mind wearing glasses, and like the way I look wearing them.
I have had regular increases, and my last prescription read, OD -4.00, OS – 3.75.
The new lenses show some nice rings, and I sure like my improved vision.


Both of us, are good students and are popular and we have no problem having dates.
I now ,have had a number of dates with David, 
David is a very handsome, glasses wearing guy, a good dancer and lots of fun.
We both are happy glasses wearers, David is hyperopic, and the lenses of his + 3.00 glasses
sure magnify his nice blue eyes, I like that look.
Amy, for some reason, always seems to make sure to date guys, who do not wear glasses.


Lately, I noticed that in most of the classes, Amy tries to sit closer the front of the class..
I also noticed, she seems to squint more often, and holds the book when she is reading a lot closer,
then she used to. I think she is now myopic, and either she does not know it, or won’t admit it.



Ashley, you won’t believe, who to day, asked me for a date?
Well, tell me.
Kevin, that real good looking quarterback, we are going to see a movie on Saturday night, and I am so
excited, he is the best and nicest looking guy in our school.
Good for you, he is quite a catch, and he is a very pleasant person.
If you need any help, to get ready, let me know.



Amy’s story


When Kevin came for our date, he looked so handsome, and escorted me to his car, where he assisted
me to get into the car.
We had a lot to talk about, and I really enjoyed his company.
Kevin is a well mannered, gentleman, and he made sure we had good seats.
After we were seated, I got a real shock, when Kevin, got a pair of glasses out of his pocket, 
and put them on,.
Oh no, I can’t believe it, Kevin wearing glasses?
After I had a good look at him, to see what he looked like wearing his glasses, and I was 
really surprised, how good he looked wearing glasses.
Kevin, I did not know you wore glasses, you sure look very handsome wearing them.
I wear my glasses during classes ,when at school, but since I am in a different class, 
you most likely did not see me wear glasses before, I wear contact lenses when playing football.
I like wearing glasses, and I am looking forward to my next eye exam, and a stronger prescription.
Amy, where are your glasses? I know Ashley wears glasses, and she sure looks nice, I would
have liked to ask her for a date, but I know she has a boyfriend.
I love the looks of girls who wear glasses, and you being Ashley’s twin, I was sure, you wore glasses.
Now, I had to think fast, for an answer.
Yes Kevin, I wear glasses, but I just realize I forgot to put the glasses in my purse.
I will make sure I wear my glasses the next time.
When looking at the movie, I realized, that I had trouble seeing the movie properly, the picture looked fuzzy.
Perhaps, Ashley, is right, I now, might be myopic to, and need to wear glasses
Well Kevin just told me he likes girls who wear glasses, and Ashley has lots of dates, perhaps 
wearing glasses is not as bad, as I thought.
We had a great night, and Kevin asked me for another date, and told me to be sure not to forget my 
glasses, and I promised him, I would not.




The next day, when Ashley, asked how I made out at the date with Kevin, I told her the whole story. 
Ashley, laughed, and told me well that is an easy problem to solve, I am sure you are myopic, and should 
be wearing glasses, so get an eye exam, and you will be wearing glasses.
Ashley, I need to have glasses to wear next Saturday, and I have no idea, when I can have an eye exam.
Ashley did not say anything, but went to her dresser, and presented me with a number of glasses cases,
these are all my old glasses, give them a try, you might find a pair you can use.
Ashley’s first glasses, were too small, for me, then I tried another pair, and another, when I put the next 
pair of glasses on, and looked around noticed that I could see quite well when wearing them, 
I walked to the window, and looked out, and could not believe, that I could see everything just perfect.
When I looked in the mirror, was really surprised how I looked wearing the glasses, I sure looked so different,
but liked the way I looked
Ashley, how do I look?
Well you look just like I did about 3 years ago, if you can see properly, wearing those glasses, you sure 
are myopic, if I remember right the prescription is about -2.50.
Well I am happy, I found a pair of glasses, to wear next Saturday when I have the next date with Kevin. 
When, I took the glasses off, could not believe, that when I looked away, how fuzzy everything looked.
I put the glasses back on, and sure noticed that now, everything was nice and clear again.
When I told Ashley, she suggested, to keep wearing the glasses, that because the glasses, I was wearing 
most likely, are very close, to he prescription I need.
Now at least, I have a pair of glasses, for my next date, and I can see perfect. .



I wore the glasses all weekend, because when I took the glasses off everything I looked at was fuzzy.
My mother asked me why I was wearing Ashley’s old glasses.
I told her I had trouble seeing in the distance, so Ashley had suggested, to try some of her old glasses, 
and realized I need to wear glasses, I can see so much better wearing these glasses, so I decided, to wear
them, until I have an eye exam, and get my own, I did not realize my vision was this poor.
On Monday, I wore the glasses to school, because when wearing the glasses could see so well, 
I did not want to take them off., and every body might as well see me wearing glasses, 
I sure need them.
When I saw Kevin, rushed over to him, so he could see me to see me wear the glasses.
Amy, I love your glasses look.
Thank you Kevin, but wait till you see me after my next eye exam, when I get new glasses.
How a person can change, now I am looking forward to my next eye exam, and new glasses.
Having had a date with Kevin, sure changed my opinion about wearing glasses, 
I now like wearing glasses.



The next date with Kevin was fun, we exchanged glasses, so exciting,.
Kevin loves the stronger prescription, I am wearing on Ashley’s old glasses, 
Now I am really looking forward to my eye exam, and hoping for an increase in the prescription, 
so my my new prescription is going to be as strong as Ashley’s.




I asked Ashley, if I could try her glasses, she handed me her glasses, and I put them on, 
Looking around, I realized that Ashley’s present prescription was to strong for me.
To bad, I was hoping my prescription, to be as strong as Ashley’s, I love the looks of her lenses,
I will have to wait and see, what will happen at the eye exam.


The day, of the exam, I was so used to wearing, Ashley’s old glasses, that I forgot to take them off.
The optometrist, after the exam, told me, my vision part only needed 1/2 diopter increase, 
but my astigmatism needed some correction.
I was so happy, stronger lenses, and a new frame, I can’t wait for my new glasses to be ready,

Three days, I found is sure a long time to wait for your new glasses.
Finally the day came, and when I put on my new glasses, and looked at myself, loved my new look,
the lenses looked so nice, and I thought I could even see, what looked like a ring on the edge.
I can’t remember, ever being as happy and excited as I am right now, with my new glasses.



When Kevin, saw my new glasses, kept on telling me how well he liked my new look.
with the stronger lenses.
On our next date, Kevin, wanted to try my glasses, and told me they were too strong for .
him, but he told me he is looking forward to his next eye exam, and he hopes an increase 
in his prescription.



After graduating from high school, Kevin and I lost track of each other, I have now a new 
glasses wearing boyfriend, and one thing I will never forget, when Kevin surprised me wearing
his glasses, and realized he looked good, and when he asked me about my glasses, and I told him,
he would see me wear them on my next date, and with Ashley’s help., made me into a 
very happy glasses wearing girl.
Ashley was right, glasses are no trouble, and have some real good benefits.
