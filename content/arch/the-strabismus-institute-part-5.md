The Strabismus Institute

Part 5 - "Sightings" at the Mall

"Just after lunch should be about right.Then, we need to do a couple of quick tests of your peripheral vision with both the 32/32 and 39/39 glasses.  It will only take about 10 minutes and you can be on your way."

We went back to Betty's car and I noticed, on the way to the mall, that I was not having any trouble with double vision at all, but I was having occasional mild funny feelings when I moved my head to one side or the other.  When we got to the mall, I mentioned the funny sensation and asked Betty if she would mind if I held her hand as we walked to the mall.

With a chuckle, she said,  "Oh Jack!, I thought you would never ask."

As we walked, I guess that she noticed that I not too sure of where I was stepping and  with concern, she said,  "Do you want to go on to the mall or back to the car?  Would you like to sit down?"

"No, I just seem to be a little dizzy."

We continued to the mall entarance and I spotted a bench, just inside the door.   "If you don t mind, let's sit down on that bench for a few minutes."

"Do we need to call Dr. Simpson?  Do you want to go back to the Institute?"

"Not yet, I had something like this when I first got my 20/20 glasses. The people said then, that it was not uncommon to have a little nausea whenever you have a big change to increased prism correction or if you have a big reduction as a result of surgery.  It has something to do with the sudden difference between what you are seeing and what you are feeling with your semi-circular canals in your head.   They said it was something similar to the cause of seasickness or airsickness.  At least, I don t feel like I need to find a trash can or hurry to the Men's Room."

After about 10 minutes, I was feeling pretty good and said, "Let's see if we can find someplace that sells soft drinks.  I have heard that Ginger Ale is good for settling your stomach, but I'll bet we would have to find a bar for that.  Maybe one of the lemon-lime drinks would work as well."

"Does your stomach feel queasy?"

"No, but why take a chance."

We soon found the food court with just about anything you might want, except a bar.  There probably wasn't much interest in hard drinks at this hour of the morning, in a shopping mall.  However, almost all the food vendors offered a variety of soft drinks from a dispenser.  We selected a vendor, ordered our drinks, and found a table.

Betty asked, "Do you feel like eating something?"

"No, not yet.  Did you have anything to eat while you were waiting?"

"Yes, they had some pastries, so fresh from the bakery they were still warn. I couldn't resist a couple, to go with that excellent coffee."

"I ate a light breakfast before we left home.  Let me drink this.  You can do a little shopping, if you want, and we can come back here for lunch.?"

 Betty nodded and asked, "How do your glasses feel, still OK?"

"Yes, The glasses are a little heavy and I was concerned about wearing this much prism, which makes me pretty cross eyed.  No, that's not right. I AM cross-eyed and I need prism glasses, so I don't have double vision.  I thought people might stare at me, but after a glance or two they don't seem to pay much attention."

"I have noticed two things, Jack.  Sometimes, when people are approaching you and there is a chance of collision, they seem a little confused about which way you will go to avoid them.  Also, I have noticed a few people, who seem to be very interested and look like they would like to ask you some questions." 

I chuckled at that.  "In the first situation, people often look at your eyes for a clue about which direction you are going to turn.  When you are cross-eyed, other people are not sure which way you intend to go.  I noticed it a little with the 20/20s, but I will bet these glasses have them really confused. Remind me to tell you about a young acquaintance who is cross-eyed and likes to play soccer.  He drives the opposing team nuts.

"In the second situation, I suspect that they may be what are called O-Os, Optical Obsessives.  There are people who like to go to the mall to look at girls, people who like to look at boys, and some people who are fascinated by glasses.  The more complex or stronger the prescription, the better.  I'll bet there are at least one or two who would give their eye teeth to find out my prescription and why I need so much prism.  Maybe I could trade a look through my glasses for our lunch a little later."  I am probably what they call a 'sighting'." 

Betty laughed and said, "I think there may have been a 'pun' in there somewhere, but I think we can buy our own lunch.  If you want me to drop you off here after you pick up your new glasses, you may be able to snag a free dinner and a ride home afterward." 

"No thanks, I'll ride home with you if that s OK.  I'm feeling much better now.  I think I am ready to stroll the mall and try to pay attention to the reactions of the people."
