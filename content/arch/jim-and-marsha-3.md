---
Saturday morning Marsha and her mom took the bus to go to the mall for their eye appointment. They entered Jones optical
and were received by a friendly lady , who asked them to fill out some forms.
Marsha was first to go in for her test. she went trough the routine of the puff test reading the chart and the phoropter
the Doctor clicking  the lenses which is better when that was finished , the letters on the wall chart looked sharp and clear and she had no trouble reading the lines.Well young lady you need glasses, you are slightly myopic, how often you wear your glasses is up to you., you will know when you need them. He gave her the prescription  -1.25 for the right eye, -1.50 for the left with a slight astigmatism .   Marsha looked at all the glasses frames on display while her mother had her exam.
She could not believe what she saw when she tried some frames and realized it was a big decision. Glasses sure changed your looks. When her mothers test was finished , she helped Marsha to pick out a nice gold frame that  looked great on her.
Her mother did not need glasses so after the paperwork and paying the bill ,they went to the food court . Marsha s glasses would be ready in about an hour. While having a drink her mother said she was surprised that she did not know about her daughters eye problem. Marsha told her she only found it out recently  when she tried Peggy s glasses and when she tried Jim s old glasses to see the movie she knew she needed glasses.About an hour later they returned to Jones optical . The optician brought out her glasses, put them on and fitted them properly.than asked or she could see with them. Marsha looked around and everything looked nice and clear. She looked at herself in the mirror and liked her new look, and wore her glasses going home.
At dinner that night her dad remarked how nice the glasses looked and was glad to have made an appointment to have every 
ones vision checked.
On Monday at school Peggy was the first to remark how pretty she looked and welcomed her to the glasses club. When Jim spotted her , he came over with  a big smile and told her she looked fantastic. She received many compliments and decided that wearing glasses was OK she liked the feel of them , the way they looked and they made her feel good. 

Jim and Marsh became very close friend, enjoyed going out together,they were considered a couple.

As time went on Marsha was due for an eye exam . Her prescription went up half a diopter on each eye.  She selected a nice brown plastic frame, that she really liked.  Dr Jones asked her if she would be interested working part time in the store helping people select frames, she would be working Saturday and one night a week . She accepted , she liked the store and the people that worked there and she loved eyeglasses. she started her job and really enjoyed helping customers select new frames and feeling good about their choice. After working there for the summer and getting to know a lot more about lenses ,glasses and contact lenses ,she decided that she wanted to become an optician.

Jim did well in school liked physics, and became very interested in optics.When he discussed it with Marsha , she suggested he become an optometrist, then they could be working together. After graduating from High school , Marsha went to college 
to become an optician, and Jim went to university to become an optometrist.

2 years later Marsha graduated as an optician and contact lens fitter. She past her provincial certification exam and now was a licensed optician. She went back to Jones optical to work full time and she loved it.
She bought herself a car , and the following weekend went to pickup Jim for a date. Jim came out and greeted her.
Marsha could not believe her eyes when she saw him. He was wearing different glasses with a very strong prescription.
When he got in the car Marsha asked what happened. He asked how do you like my glasses? She said I guess they are all right, but what is the story?
Jim explained that now they were doing some practical work , he said the guys were having fun with glasses over contacts
he was wearing -15 00 and could see fine with +4 .00 contacts. Marsha was not impressed and did not want to try it.
She told Jim what he did with his friends was fine , but she liked his regular glasses,

Everything at Marsha s work was fine , Dr.Jones was very pleased with her work and asked if Jim might like to join them when he graduated? He would like to start taking life a little easier to get ready for retirement. Jim was all for it and after graduating went to work at Jones Optical

They got married a short time later . the Bride and the groom looked fantastic wearing their new glasses 

A few years later Dr. Jones retired and sold the business to Jim and Marsha. Everything was great, they loved each other loved the business , loved glasses and were very happy.
