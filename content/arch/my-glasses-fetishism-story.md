description: Discover the captivating journey of an 18-year-old grappling with his unconventional glasses fetish and impending need for vision correction.
---
Hello everyone, my name is Henry and I'm 18 and I just want to share my own story so hopefully it can be seen by some people who can relate to me.

I think it all started when one of my best friend and her sister got glasses when I was around 10. I was a bit shocked to learn that my friend now had to have this plastic piece of clothing on his face during the day. I was hoping that maybe the doctor made a mistake or maybe he'll grow them out, anyways he wore contacts most of the time.

Fast forward to when I'm 12 and a girl in my class got glasses and I put them on for fun. For some reason I could read posters on the walls I couldn't see before. After a few seconds I took them off and pretended that nothing happened. However I started having doubts as to wether my eyesight was good enough. As more and more people started getting glasses I was getting increasingly worried that I might be the next one. I tried googling "percentage of children who need glasses" to get a feeling for my chances. 

Also I realised at that point that the idea of wearing glasses was kinda sexually arousing for me. That mainly with glasses but I shared a bit of that feeling with other wearables too such as watches or necklaces.

Some years passed and using the trick of pinching my eye a bit I could see the board clearly in school so even though I knew I had an issue I didn't want to do anything about it. Eventually when I was 16 or so, I had successfully participated in no nut November so on the evening of nov 30th I wanted to redeem my "price" and have a really nice fap. So I finally bit the bullet and casually told my dad that I might have trouble with my vision. That indeed worked to get my hard.

As my fetish continued to develop I was one of the few teens that didn't watch porn. It's not that it wasn't arousing me but I just prefered to either imagine my own sexual fantasies or something related to glasses. Then I started looking up youtube videos of people at my age getting glasses for the first time. I always wanted to see their reaction to being told they need them by their doctor (which is always left out of the video for some reason). Also my parents either forgot that I needed to go to the doctor or just hoped that it's no big deal.

Finally I'm here. 18 years old, still no glasses and I'm still in school needing them bad for seeing far away. From some home eye exams that I have taken and comparing my vision to an online perscription simulator I have determined that I have around 1.5 diopters of astigmatism. Also I have started using chat GPT to help me act out the scenario of getting glasses. I always tell it to be the doctor and strictly force me to wear my glasses full time. Thats all I have, hope to hear some of your replies!
