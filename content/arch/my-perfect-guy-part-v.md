Final part coming tomorrow  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike and I decided we wanted to be together, but we couldn’t figure out ourselves alone so we went to a therapist.

At first I had to come clean and tell him the whole story about how I was now a disabled girl without glasses or contacts and that it was my choice to be this way. Tbh I was pleasantly surprised when he said he understood and Mike kinda looked at him weird. 

“I’ve tried to talk to her and advise her better. I’ve had so many issues since I was little for having such poor vision I just can’t believe she would do this to herself” Said Mike
“Mike, you should try judging her less and accepting her more if you want to be with her” Said Dr. Charles “I don’t know what your condition is, but I’m assuming you can’t have Lasik surgery to correct it, am I right?” he asked calmly 
“No, I can’t. The risk of my retinas detaching is too high at this point and the amount of Cylinder and prism my glasses correct would not improve with surgery and I’d have to wear them either way” Mike answered
“Ok, let’s imagine for a minute you actually had the chance to have perfect vision through a medical procedure. Imagine it’s cheap enough for you to pay for it and there are not that many risks… Would you have it done?” Dr. Charles asked
“ABSOLUTELY! I wouldn’t even doubt about it” Mike said 
“Why?” 
“Because I hate these things” Said Mike pointing to his glasses “I hate having to wear them every waking moment. I hate having to scrunch up my eyes at everything even with this amount of correction; I hate so much not being able to take a fucking shower without them. I am strong, I am smart and yet I’m absolutely depending on something so fragile… I hate them!” Said Mike almost crying 

“Ok, and haven’t you thought that maybe Nikki felt the same but instead of feeling the need to get rid of the glasses she feels the need of having them?” Came Mr. Charles Answer
“But how could she? She has seen me deal with this, she has seen how hard it is to me not to be able to be the man she needs.” Mike said
“Woooah, Michael you have to get over yourself honey. I love you so much but not everything is about you and your glasses. I thought your glasses were cool but when I began wearing mine I realized I had found myself. I don’t need a man who is indestructible, I need a man who understands we are all humans and there are deficiencies that instead of making you weak make you interesting. I’m gonna tell you something that will sound aweful but I’m here cause I want to be here. There are a lot of guys out there who would die to be with someone like me, abled and disabled. If I’m here trying this is because I can see past your glasses. Do you think maybe you can see past mine?” I said
Those words must have meant something to him because he sat there silently and heard me and the Doc. Go on and on for 30 minutes about how happy I was now that I needed such strong glasses till it was time to wrap the session and go home. 
 
My glasses prescription changed a little bit like it was predicted by the doc who did the procedure it now read: 

O.D.  -26.50  / -1.0 x100
O.S. -25.75 / -1.75 x90
It was actually not as bad as Mikes (He wears -34 and -36 and some prisms and cylinder correction but I’m not that sure cause he hasn’t gone to the ophthalmologist in a long time)

Ever since that last therapy Mike has been different, he has come to terms with me loving my bad eyesight and also loving his. 

“Babe, I want us to go swimming. I’m thinking I should book us an appointment in that new place near the Hilton Hotel to get swimming goggles with our prescriptions. What do you say?” I asked him casually while I was making dinner for the both of us

“Prescription goggles? Imagine how goofy we’d look! No, babe I think we can go swimming without prescription goggles. You don’t even need to have your eyes open when you’re underwater, plus those things must be very expensive.” Mike answered
I was irritated but I knew I was gonna get my way, I knew I could afford those goggles and more!
“Ok honey, as you say. Do you think maybe we could go tomorrow? I’m thinking maybe at 8 am?” I said to him already having a plan in my head.
“Sure” he said
We had dinner and we went to sleep. 

I woke up at 6 am and got everything ready for our return to the physical activity, Mike couldn’t wear contacts since his prescription got prisms in it and I could but he knew I didn’t like it so it was really gonna be our bare eyes in that lake. 
 
It was a beautiful summer morning and thankfully we had the lake to ourselves, Mike took his shirt off and even with him not exercising for the last 6 months he looked FINE! He walked to the dock, put his glasses on the ground and jumped into the water. 
He then came out of the water and yelled at me “See honey? We don’t need those goofy goggles!”
I knew this wasn’t a good idea, so I kept my spare glasses on held by a strap and I went into the lake. 
He swam really well and I enjoyed so much seeing him scrunching up his eyes and the more he tried to see something the more his eyes crossed. 
I swam a little bit far and I saw him going out of the water. I was using a spare pair of glasses that had an outdated prescription so I couldn’t make him out that good but I could see him well enough to notice him search for his glasses. When I saw him on his knees I swam right to him.

“What’s wrong babe?” I asked
“I can’t find my fucking glasses. I know I left them here” he said
“Let me see” I said as I searched for the glasses “No babe, they’re definitely not here”
“FUCK! Nikki I left them here, with my sandals” he said
“Uhmm baby your sandals are floating mid lake” I said
“What?! But how?! There are no waves here!!!!” He yelled 
“I know babe but water moves and we have been moving inside the lake” I said
“Ohhh no, no this can’t be happening, no. I can’t fucking see anything. Please help me look for them underwater nikki, please!!” he begged 
“Ok babe, cross your fingers” I said while looking everywhere but I couldn’t find them. 

Of course I wasn’t gonna find them if I’m the one who lost them in the first place… 

Mike was a douche before and he owe me a few, plus he needed new glasses and I wanted prescription goggles. Please don’t judge me; it was for a greater good.
