Hollie had just turned 18 she was 5ft 9 tall with long blond hair she was slim and growing up never had a shortage of boyfriends and girlfriends. Today was Saturday Hollie decided to go to the mall she wanted to buy clothes. After wandering around she felt rather tired do decided to sit in the malls seating area that's when her life started to change looking round she saw a girl about she guessed the same age as Hollie  being pushed in a wheelchair my an attractive looking women as they came closer Hollie realised the girl in the chair was wearing myopic glasses her eyes looked tiny behind the lenses, what shocked Hollie was the girl had some kind of wire frame round her face (she later learned it was an orthodontic facemask) and if that wasn't enough she had 2 huge BTH  hearing aids. Hollie looked at her and as they got closer she smiled at the girl Hollie realised she was a bit turned on seeing  the girl before long they had gone Hollie decided to try to find d them again she was fascinated by this disabled girl deep down Hollie realised she wanted to be her! There was no sign of her  so Hollie went home. Next day and the day after she went to the mall but absolutely no sign of her. Hollie thought she must of been visiting the area she wandered round did her shopping picked up a couple of bits her friend wanted and was just heading home  when someone behind her said Hello Hollie she turned round it was the wheelchair girl and the lady pushing her who smiled at Hollie hi how are you doing? How did you know my name? Asked Hollie oh we know a lot about you she said let me introduce myself this is Mandy she said gesturing to the girl in the wheelchair and I'm Christine she shook Hollies hand can you come with us to a little private area there's something we want to chat to you about. Hollie wasn't sure but for some reason she felt compelled to go OK she said

Once in the spacious private office Mandy and Christine positioned themselves in front of Hollie Christine said myself and Mandy own this mall when we saw you in here the other day you were the only one who didn't stare or make rude comments about mandy  so we have decided to make you an offer  if you would be willing to live like Mandy for six months  we will hand over ownership of the mall to you when I retire
Hollie was shocked I don't know what to say she said how can I be so disabled for just six months? Mandy spoke for the first time it's easy she said we own a clinic they will fix tou up with the braces and glasses you need like they did for me you may even choose to stay this was  like I did. Hollie said you mean your not really disabled? Oh I am now said Mandy Hollie couldn't help herself she leaned forward and gently kissed mandy I'm in she said I want to be like you. I knew said Christine another devotee Mandy said and a real cute one at that Hollie blushed
