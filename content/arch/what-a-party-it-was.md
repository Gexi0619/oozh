What a party it was!!!!!!!!
A real FANTASY story.

Jim, and I [Nicole] are recently married after graduating from university.
We both have good jobs, and really are enjoying married life.
At supper to night, Jim mentioned that lately he noticed that a lot more people are wearing glasses now.
Yes, I agree, and I think lot of people look very nice wearing glasses. 
I have always liked the looks of glasses, and sometimes am sorry that I don t need them.
Glasses are a fashion statement now, and there is no shame anymore having to wear glasses,  some people even wear fake glasses, just to be seen in the latest fashion.
We agreed that most people look very smart wearing glasses, and now realize we both like the looks of glasses, and now we are wondering what it would be like having to wear glasses.
Jim suggested we go to the mall and visit the optical store and just for fun, look at some glasses, to see what we look like wearing glasses.
We drove to the mall and entered the optical store.
When the optician approached us, I told her we would like to look at some new frames.
She asked, who are we looking for?
I told her that they would be for me.
She looked at me, and suggested some different frames.
When I tried them on, was really surprised how attractive I looked wearing glasses.
My husband agreed, Nicole I love your look when wearing glasses, you look fantastic.
So, what about you, I sure would like to see what you look like wearing glasses..
Then Jim tried some different frames.
Jim looks so handsome wearing glasses, I can t believe it.
We are now so excited about our glasses look, that we decided to make an appointment for an eye exam.
That night, all we talked about was how good we both looked wearing glasses.
What a night we had.

We certainly were excited when we went for our eye exam.
Jim was first, and when he came out smiling, I was sure he was prescribed glasses.
I did not have time to talk to him, as I was due for my eye exam.
I was really surprised when the optometrist asked me which is better 1 or 2., was I going to wear prescription glasses?
When the optometrist was finished, he told me I am myopic, and wearing glasses would improve my distance vision.
If you don t want to wear your glasses full time, I do recommend, that you should be wearing your glasses when driving at night.
I was all excited I was going to wear real glasses, Jim would be so pleased.
We had a wonderful time selecting a frame, and after the proper measurements were told to come back in about an hour and our glasses would be ready.

Sitting in the food court enjoying some refreshments, we discussed our exam experiences.
Jim told me he is a hyperopic, and was told he would notice an improvement with his work on the computer and when reading.
The blurriness for distance vision will soon correct itself when I wear the glasses full time.
I told him that I am myopic, but do not have to wear the glasses full time, if I did not want to, 
but should wear them for driving at night.
We were both very excited, we are going to wear glasses, and could not wait for our glasses to be ready.

About an hour later when we walked into the optical store, our glasses were ready
It did not take long to get Jim s glasses fitted. 
When he looked at me with a great big smile on his face, I almost fainted, he looked so handsome.
Then it was my turn, after the glasses were fitted and I looked around, noticed a definite improvement in my vision, I must have needed glasses.
Jim was all smiles when he looked at me, walked over and gave me a great big kiss, you look so fantastic.
On the way home we were like a couple of excited children on Christmas morning. 
The rest of the night we leave to your imagination.

Jim spend a lot of time on the computer to learn more about glasses, vision and prescriptions.
About a week later Jim showed me a place on the computer where you can order glasses on line for a very reasonable price..
He asked me if I would be interested in a couple more pair of glasses..
I love wearing my glasses, and told him I would love a few more pair.
Jim and I selected a couple of frames that would look good on me, and told me he would place the order.
What I did not know was, that Jim loves the look of myopic lenses so much, that he ordered the lenses ½ diopter stronger than my prescription.
When the glasses arrived and I tried them on noticed the stronger prescription, but when I looked at myself in the mirror loved the look of the new lenses, now you can really see that I wear prescription glasses.
I was surprised how quickly I could see just fine wearing the stronger prescription.
I really enjoy being able to wear glasses that match the outfit I am wearing, it makes me feel beautiful.

In early December some friends from university arranged for a little get together before Christmas, at a nice restaurant with a dance floor so we could have a nice party.
We were really looking forward to it,
The night of the party we were all dressed up, wore our glasses, and were looking forward to the comments we would get.
Knowing that, Kim, Ashley, and Kelley would be there and knowing what they are like, I put all my glasses in my purse.
When we arrived at the party, the first thing I heard was, Nicole you look fantastic, I love your new glasses look.
I was beaming, I like compliments like that.
After a few drinks and just before we were ready to eat, Kim, Ashley Kelley and I excused ourselves to go and powder our noses.
When we entered the bathroom, Kim asked me if she could try my glasses, I would like to see how I look wearing glasses.
I had expected this and pulled my glasses out of my purse.
Then Kelley told us she already wears glasses, but did not wear them as she did not want to be the only girl wearing glasses.
Thank goodness, I can wear my glasses now and make my husband happy.
Kim and Ashley loved so much how they looked wearing glasses, they did not want to take the glasses off.  
So when we went back to see the boys all of us were wearing glasses.
We will never forget the looks on their faces, when they saw all of us marching in wearing glasses..
The biggest surprise I got was when I realized, that all the guys loved the look of girls wearing glasses l
Jim had to pas his glasses around so all the girls could see what their guy would look like wearing glasses.
We had a great night, and agreed to have another get together and celebrate New Year s eve.
I made sure I collected my glasses before I went home.

Jim without me knowing it, ordered some different glasses for himself and a couple more pair for me.
and this time added ¼ diopter to all of them.
When the glasses arrived and I tried them on noticed again an improvement in my vision and when I tried my first glasses that I got 3 months ago, noticed that with my new prescription I can see much better.
I really like Jim s new glasses, with the little higher prescription his beautiful brown eyes look a little larger now, I love that look.
Surprising what can happen in a short time.
A little over 3 months ago we found out we both like the looks of glasses.
Now we both wear glasses full time, and love wearing them.

We are getting ready for our New Years party.
Since I can t make up my mind which glasses to wear I asked Jim which pair?.
After modeling a few different pairs Jim said the tortoiseshell, which are one of my new ones that I really like.
Just for fun, I put a couple of other pairs in my purse, you never can tell.

Since we were the first couple there, we sat so that we could see each couple coming in.
Kelley came in next she was wearing her glasses, and I noticed her husband now is wearing glasses to.
Kelley smiled when she asked me how I liked Logan s new look.
I told her looked terrific.
Well I talked him into getting his eyes examined.
He was prescribed glasses and I love his new look and I am so happy.
The best part is, he now likes wearing his glasses.
When Kim and her husband came in we could not believe our eyes both of them were wearing glasses.
Kim told us Matthew wanted her to wear glasses, so she told him I will wear glasses, but you will have to wear glasses to, and believe it or not we both love wearing glasses now.
When Ashley came in all smiles and she to was wearing glasses, she told us that she had talked Jeff her husband in getting glasses, but he is very shy about wearing them. 
We told her we look after that.
After we had a few drinks, we asked Jeff to show us his new glasses, reluctantly he put them on.
We all complimented him on how handsome he looked, he smiled and wore his glasses the rest of the night.
I really enjoyed the dancing, looking at peoples eyes through lenses is so fascinating, and when you dance close the touching of glasses feels very sexy.
We all started the New Year full of expectations, looking through the lenses of our glasses.
and look back on the old year and our PARTY !!!!!!!
