description: David's perfect world shattered when vengeful classmates stole his glasses, leaving him blind and vulnerable.

[This is before David met Katie]

David had been acing college. At just 18 he was already at the top of a senior-level class. This class, in particular, was a weed-out class for people who wanted to get into a competitive graduate school. The final exam had been taken and he had just busted the curve.

Karen and Kailey, two of his classmates, had not done so well on the final and their dreams of getting into graduate school were in a shambles. Both were furious and wanted to get revenge on David.

David wore very thick glasses that he was blind without. At -17 they stuck out of his plastic frame.

Karen and Kailey knew where to find David- the three of them all lived in the same dorm building. They found David sitting in a common room. The room was empty.

Karen was wearing a blue tank top and jean skirt, while Kailey was wearing a pink tank top and flower-print skirt. They went up to David and sat down at his table.

"Uh, hey Karen, hey Kailey" said David.Â 

"Hey." said Karen.

"So tell me, David" said Kailey. "Those are some pretty thick glasses. Can you see without them?"

"Oh no." said David. "I'm blind without my glasses"

"So they're your eyes." said Karen. "You can't see anything without them."

"Yeah" said David.

With that Karen snatched the glasses off David.

"Can't see now, can you?" asked Kailey
