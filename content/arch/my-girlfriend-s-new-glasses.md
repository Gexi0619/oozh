Hey there!

So, i'm gonna tell you a real story here. Hope you enjoy!

I have always had a big fetish for girls wearing thick glasses, for both minus and plu lenses, but never really had the chance to date someone who wore glasses like that. 

In early 2017 i met a girl and It ended up becoming a long term and very stable relationship. After some time, i decided It was time to open myself to her and tell her about my fetish. Since i didn't know how she was going to react, i just mentioned that i'd like her to wear glasses for me sometimes, but without giving so much details. She didn't seem to understand so well, but after some discussions about that, she decided to buy some non prescription glasses.

Some days later, we went to the store to choose her glasses. I was very excited and started to look for the perfect frames for her. I spotted some translucent pink frames and showed to her. She got a little angry because that was definitely not her style. She thought i could have been trying to make her look like somebody else, so we went back home with empty hands.

After some months, she was already accepting the idea and had already understood it was just a fetish of mine. I explained her exactly what i like and showed her some examples of very thick glasses i saw in the Found On The Web section. We went to the store again and finally bought some nice black frames with a +2,50 prescription. That was not exactly what i wanted, but at the time it was enough for me to finally be able to see my girlfriend's eyes a little magnified by the lenses.

About a year later, i was still dreaming of my girlfriend wearing some really thicker glasses. Once in a while i would tell her how much i would like that and, one day, she finally agreed to let me buy any glasses that i wanted for her to use regardless the prescription or the frame style. So, i took a search on the web and found the perfect glasses, the glasses of my dreams. It was some metal rectangular frames with -21 lenses. She asked for a picture of the glasses i have choosen and seemed to be a little shocked by something so "different" but embraced the idea and said she was ezcited to see how she would look wearing them.

Yesterday, i was checking the track number i found out the glasses were going to be delivered in just some hours. We still live in different places by now, so i sent her a message to let her aware and alert to receive the package. Later, out of nowhere, she sent me some pictures wearing them and... Wooow. I have never felt so attracted and so in love for anyone before. She is already a very beautiful woman, but with those glasses she became simply amazing. 

Since she is now very comfortable with the glasses subject, i made her some questions about the glasses and how she was feeling about that. The answer was that she couldn't see nothing but a big blur and colors with them. Because of that, she took a while to get some focused pictures since she could not see the c√¢mera. Besides that, she made sure to tell me it has pretty strong lenses. Well, she knows what i like to hear... Now, i'm just waiting for the weekend to be able to see her with her cokebottles in person.
