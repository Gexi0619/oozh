description: Optometry student desperate for work finds opportunity in a run-down shop with hidden potential.
---
My name is James Bright,

I'm just finishing my four years at university studying to be an Optometrist.
I had hoped to extend my study by an extra year to specialise in low vision,but my finances would not allow that.

Now was the time to find work.As part of our training we had visited many of the large multiple chains of optical stores.
But I preferred the more friendly approach of the smaller independent shops.also they could offer a larger range of special lenses


Unfortunately there seemed to be less and less private optical shops now, and none of them seemed to advertise for staff in the opticians Weekly magazine.

I was starting to get desperate, then I spotted this small advert

“Wanted an assistance to help in a small family business”

I don't know why they put a photo with it as the shop looked tired and run down , but maybe they were proud of it in the past

I rang to ask if the position was still available and to make and appointment for an interview if it was.

The next day I nervously opened the door, it was dark and old fashioned inside,an elderly gentleman greated me.

He explained that his eldest daughter was married and had moved away 5 years ago and was not interested in the business and his younger daughter was disabled and stayed upstairs  and only helped with the paperwork.

“It's very hard to manage on my own, I need and assistant now, but I can't afford the high wages most qualified Optometrist want, but if you were interested  there is a small apartment upstairs that used to be my oldest daughter, you could have that rent free”
“Would you like to look around”

I did not know what to say,it was not what I had dreamed about but at least it was somewhere to live  and any money was better than none.

“is this your total selection of frames or you have other not on display”

“I have lots of old frames and many glass lens downstair, I used to fit the lens myself but now I can't manage to do that as well as testing ”

That intreaded me as I took an extra course to be an optician as well.

When I told him that he looked excited”

His examination room was very small and rather untidy, but when we went into the basement, I was shocked by boxes full of NHS frames in pink and blue and transparent colours and unused blanks,many outside the range of the multiples.

When we got back upstairs he looked at me.

“It was very nice meeting you. I'm sorry if you are disappointed In what you have seen, I hope you find a good job. You seem  very talented

“Why do you think I'm disappointed in what I have seen, is there any reason why you have not offered me the job
“You are very talented why would you want to work here, you can earn much more working for one of the big companie
“Also I thought I had cancelled the advert I had desided to close down soon. I used to be very proud of my business but every one that came for an interview said they weren't interested in working in this place . It was very hurtful to hear the Language they used.

“May I go into the basement again and make a phone call while I'm down there”

What I didn't tell him was that I wanted to talk to my professor.

My professor said it was a very sad story, the practice  used to be very successful but sadly his wife died,she used to do all the testing,and he was used to working in the laboratory. He was widely admired for his skill with high prescription patients,I thought the business had closed.
I said I was thinking of going to work there but lots of the testing equipment was very tired and much out of date.
He said if I wanted to update a lot of it he was sure he could get me the equipment I needed from some of his contacts, as it was a shame so many small optical shops were closing

 When I returned upstairs I  told him I had a plan that might suit us both, it would take me a few days to put together..

He suggested I come to lunch on Sunday and he would be happy to listen to what my plan was and I could meet his Daughter.

Friday after classes  my professor called me into his office and told me that he had arrange for some reps to meet me on Monday morning and discuss what  testing equipment I needed and if they could help me
Also he had talked to a few frame companies and he hoped some of their reps might have some spare samples I could have free of charge.

On Saturday morning I rang my older brother who has a carpentry business, and asked him to help me refit the shop and make a new sign.

Sunday morning I walked around to the back of the shop and rang the doorbell,Mr Jones seemed very pleased to see me.

“Let's go and sit in the lounge first , would you like a beer?”

As we passed the kitchen door I could just see the back of a young lady, she had long blonde hair and slim legs,and seemed to be walking ok, who could this be he said his daughter was disabled and worked up stairs
30 mins later I heard a voice call out.

“The lunch is on the table dad, hope it's ok I will have mine in the kitchen”

As we sat down in the dining room there was only 2 places laid

“My Daughter is very shy, I think she will eat hers in the kitchen she is rather disabled”

“May I go into the kitchen and invite her to join us”
Before he had time to answer I was already beside the open kitchen door,
As she heard footsteps  she said “what's wrong Dad?”
And suddenly turned, 

In my 4 years of training I had never meet a young lady with such a high hypermetropia prescription.
We just stopped and stared at each other then she turn her back on me”

“I'm sorry if I scared you, please come and join us,it looks like such a lovely lunch. I gently took hold of her hand, and escorted her into the dining room and pulled out my chair for her to sit on, then returned to the kitchen to get the other plate of food before sitting opposite her.

What should I do if I keep looking at her? Would she feel embarrassed but if I looked away would she think I couldn't bear to look at her.


I asked her father all about the business, he seem to enjoy reliving all the memories,after we had finished the meal I helped June clear the plates away then insisted she come and sit with us while I explained my plan
I would arrange for the shop and testing room to be refitted with new equipment I would take over the testing and Mr Jones could return to the lab and make up the glasses, 
Mr Jones suggested that June take me up to her office and show me the account before we both finally agreed to everything.

And if everything went well I would become a full partner, thus ensuring the business continued.

June was very pleasant to talk to, I could tell from the books that the business had seen better times, but was still making a profit, 
On the desk was a large magnifying glass mounted on a frame under which June passed the books as she explained things to me.

She turned to look at me  

“I'm sorry that I can't help dad more,as you can tell I'm nearly blind, but I do the best I can for him, if you want to get a receptionist I will understand”

“Why would I want to do that your writing is beautiful and everything looks perfect”

I keep secretly looking at June's large eyes, the highest hypermetropia prescription. I had seen before was plus 22 , but it was obvious that June's were a much higher prescription than that,and also with a significant amount of astigmatism correction
Before going home that night I placed a large notice in the window

CLOSED FOR 2 WEEKS FOR REFITTING 

On Monday my brother arrived and started ripping the place apart, I just hoped what my professor promised would happen.

By the middle of the first week equipment had started to arrive, most of it wasn't brand new,but considerably better than what was here before.

I persuaded June to let me test her eyesight with our new equipment before we opened next week.
Neither June or her father had seen much of this equipment before.


I slowly removed her glasses, I could instantly tell that she had been wearing glasses from a very early age maybe as young as 6 months, her eye sockets look very sunken and wrinkled,normally this is associated with and older patient that has worn glasses for 30 or 40 years also she had deep bags under her eyes

In addition she had very little control of her eye mussels in less that a minute after removing her glasses she was peering TOTALLY crossed eyed as she tried to focus on me 

First I sat June In Front of our new autorefractor, I was rather taken aback, I had never experienced a printout like this before.

Even Mr Jones looked shocked at the printout for the suggested prescription of his daughter .


Not only was she extremely long-sighted but also suffered from binocular double vision.

It took a long time to settle on the best combination of lens
R+28 + 6.50 170 prism out 10
L +29 +5.50. 172 prism out 12
ADD 4.00
We had 2 pairs of test  frames so I suggest June wore them for the rest of the day, one pair with the distance prescription and the other for reading.

I told Mr Jones that I had thought about suggesting we get a new computer system for customer records instead of the card system that was used now,but June had it so beautifully organised that  I thought June could work downstairs and be our receptionist as well.
He wasn't sure that June would like that idea, but I said I would take her with me to look at new cabinets  and a desk and a chair and after that go for lunch.

June was a little reluctant at first, especially when I suggested she keep the test frames on, but she had to admit she could see much further and everything looked much clearer so after giving it some thought she came back and agreed.

Her father looked very surprised when I told him that June had agreed.

“Please look after her she hasn't been out since her mother died”

When June came downstairs it was my turn to be shocked.
Despite the fact that she was wearing the black test frames,she looked very pretty,She was well endowed with a slim waist.and wearing a very attractive dress and a small amount of makeup on

“Would you mind if I held your hand please? I'm not used to walking outside,when I was at school I had a cane but everybody teased me, so I stopped using it and stayed home after I left school”

“I noticed you had a fold up cane in the corner of your office it's ok if you want to bring it with us it could go in my briefcase’ wait there I will go and get it””

“Thank you, are you sure you really want me to wear these test frames, I could manage with my old glasses”


“Which can you see best with dear”

“O the test frames are much clearer to see with,but are you sure you want to be seen with me wearing them James”

“It's fine, the main thing is to improve what you are able to see?

We decided to go to IKEA  to look for office equipment and furniture for my room. 

When we arrived I picked up a catalogue and suggested June sat down while I got us a coffee, when I came back June was searching her handbag.

“What is the problem June”

“I forgot to put my magnifying glass in I can't see anything in this catalogue without it”

“Don't worry had you forgotten that I made you a different prescription for reading, have you never had a pair of reading glasses before”

“No father said he couldn't get the lens for me”

I opened my briefcase  and took out the other test frame with the reading prescription in.

I lent forward and carefully removed the test frame that June was wearing.

Somehow I loved the crosseyed vacant look that June was giving me, I don't know what came over me but I really wanted to kiss her,but this was not the time and place.

“Is everything ok James I can't see anything but I know you are looking at my eyes”

“No everything is fine I was just waiting for your eye muscles to relax before putting the other test frames on for you to read”

“It's ok James I know you are trying to be kind but I know my eyes look ugly without glasses as well as when I wear glasses I once once had a friend that insisted on taking a photo of me not wearing glasses,then he laughed and said I was cross eyed”

I didn't reply but just placed the test frames with her reading prescription on her.

“Wow James , how have you managed that? I can read every do easily, thank you”

Without warning she lent over and gave me a soft kiss,before she had time to pull away and put my arms around her,and suddenly we were exchanging passionate kisses.

We were both speechless.

I had always dreamed of meeting and marrying a highly myopic girl with tiny eyes peering through  tiny circles in thick double -digit lens, not a girl that was hypermetropia and her enormous eyes looking at me through thick bulging lens

We both tried to pretend that nothing had happened and continued looking through the catalogues.

After putting June's distance glasses back on we spent the rest of the morning shopping 

“Will you be ok waiting her while I go and pay dear, would you like me to get you a coffee first”

“Yes please James”

“Your cane and reading glasses are in my briefcase if you want them”

“Thank you James”

After paying and loading everything in the van I had hired I returned to join June , but at first I couldn't fine her, then I noticed she had moved and was sitting near the window,as I got closer I could see she was wearing the reading glasses that I had fitted in the test frame and the other were on the table, and leaning against her chair was her white cane.

“O James you made me jump I didn't hear you coming, I was enjoying reading this catalogue it so much easier to see it with these glasses on and not having to hold a magnifying glass”

June carefully removed the reading frames making sure the lens didn't fall out.
She looked straight at me and gave me a big smile, her hands slowly moving across the table searching for her distance glasses.all the while looking straight at me and making no attempt to straighten her hypermetropic eyes.

I think June has realised I love seeing her crossed eyed,

“Will you put my glasses on for me please, I don't feel as embrashed wearing them when I feel you hooking them over my ears”

I Picked up the reading glasses and returned the to my briefcase before closing i

“Don't forget your cane dear it's beside your chair still”

“O sorry James I thought I had put it away before you came back I had to use it to help me find the table. Will  fold it up and put it back in the briefcase”

“Nothing to be sorry about June.If we are going to spend more time outside together I think you should get used to using it again dear”

“Which hand shall I hold dear”

“It's such a long time since I have used the cane, I think I would like to try using it with my left hand, are you sure you don't mind being seen holding my right hand”

How could I answer that?

What would she think if I told her the truth?

I loved looking at her Hugh hypermetropic eyes and emanging how much bigger they were going to look though the new higher powered lens that I would  be making especially for her this week,also how exciting it was when her eyes crossed without the help of her glasses. It didn't matter how tiny and sunken they looked without her glasses it was the cross eyed look that turned me on.The sight of her holding the cane just added to enjoyment.

When we got home she couldn't wait to tell her father everthing.

“I've had a wonderful day Dad. We have bought lots of furniture for James' room and an office desk and cabinet for the shop. The temporary glasses in the test frames  that  James made for me were wonderful and I don't need to use a magnifying glass to read, if I put the reading glasses on”

“Oooo I forgot to tell you, James suggested that I use my cane again, you know I hated it when I was at school but  having James with me gave me the confidence to try using  it again.

“He said he admired me, and had enjoyed my company”

“Well James You seem to have made a hit with my daughter, I hope your not going to hurt her”

“No Mr Jones I won't take advantage of her, I hope we can all work together and return the business to what it used to be like,and later June can be more involved, with modern technology June will be able to do more to help us”

June looked very tired so I ordered a take away for us, and we had an early night, as June was about to go into her bed room I gave her a big hug and thanked her for a lovely day, she slowly removed her glasses, she leant towards me.As she got closer  both her eyes started to cross,she smiled.
”Do I get a good night kiss please James ”

How could I resist such an offer , also I told her I thought she looked sexy when her eyes crossed.

The next morning I woke early and made my way downstairs. I had just put the kettle on for a cup of tea, when I heard a voice behind me.

As I turned I could see it was June, I was pleased but also surprised  to see that she was wearing the test frames with her distance prescription in them

“Is it ok if I wear these until you have made my new glasses for me, I can see so much better with them,could you adjust them a little they keep slipping down a little”

Before I had time to reply she had taken them off and handed them to me,then  gave me a long staring look as her eyes slowly starting  to cross”

I told her to sit down while I made a cup of tea and some roast for out breakfasts then I would adjust them for her.i pleased them on the table in front of her, expecting her to put them straight back on.

“Do you really find me sexy when my eyes cross James?, or are you just saying that to make me feel better,when in fact you think I'm ugly, just like all the boys at school said

“It might sound strange but I find it exciting,when your eyes start to cross and you can't straighten them,”

I gave June a big hug 

“If I used my  cane I could  try to manage without glasses sometimes if you would like me to”

“Would you like me to leave them off now “

“Let's wait until we are alone dear”
“Today I will get your new glasses dear, I am going to the university this morning to collect the blanks and fit them in one of the pink NHS frames you father has in the basement, they are all the fashion now vintage styles 

As soon as I got home June greeted me with a big smile.

“Have you made my new glasses James”

 “O James, the lens do bulge out a lot in the middle, but I'm so excited,can I try them please?”
“Wow James I can see so clearly now, even though you have put opaque occlusion foil on them,but why have you done that?”

“It's not opaque occlusion foil dear, they are stick on fresnel prism foils,they will help keep your eyes from crossing”

“Do my eyes cross a lot James,even in these new glasses   Do you find it a turn off?

“I only put the prism fresnel on to keep your eyes straight so you can see better dear,you know I don't mind your eyes crossing,your prescription is a lot stronger than before,I'm sure you know you are very hypermetropia, Long sighted  and you have need a very  high Astigmatism  correction now, thats why your lens are much thicker now in the middle”

“I find it interesting how your eyes cross as soon as you take your glasses off, you look just as pretty dear, I'm hoping to do more research into this”

“I like the new pink glasses on you dear much prettier than The old glasses you had before”

“Thank you James, that makes me feel better that you understand I need glasses . I used to have a small pair of  NHS glasses similar to these when I was at school,but I was teased so much about my glasses and the ugly lens that I hated them”
“But you are right this style seems to be the height of fashion now, but so expensive, they must have cost you a lot”

“Can I see my reading glasses please, I have never had separate pair of reading glasses before my Father said he count get the lens, I have had to used the magnifying frame before and a magnifying glasses to read in bed”

“O James they are the same frames but in blue I love them, where did you get them from dear”

“Your father has boxes of them in his basement they are the original NHS frames dear”

“Wow haha we must bring some up the put in the window display and on the new display racks in the shop,

The new shop sign arrived today.

BRIGHT EYES  OPTICAL

June was excited. She loved her new desk and had all her files in the new cabinets, also her new reading glasses were on her desk ready for tomorrow and her cane nearby.

As we went upstairs to bed, I was just about to say goodnight to her.

“James will you come into my bedroom I want to talk to you “

“What if your father should happen to see me”

“It's ok Father know I want to talk to you”

What could this be.

“I'm worried about tomorrow James I'm going to find it difficult talking to the customers ”

“You will be ok June we have already got some Booking that you took”

“There is something I have not told you James, I hate using the phone, and I'm sure I will not understand everything people are asking me”

“Why is that dear you have got your new reading glasses”

“Why are you shaking dear? there's nothing to worry about”

“I should have told you before, but I didn't want to loose you as a friend and the business means so much to Dad, that I didn't  want you to change your mind” 

“I have become very fond of you June, I think the 3 of us can make the business a success again”

“Please sit down James I have to tell you somthing”

“When I was at school you know I hated wearing glasses and was teased a lot”

“Yes dear so what's the big problem”

“I had to wear a hearing aid as well” 

“Ok so what's the problem, you can wear it tomorrow, I knew you had a problem hearing some words”

“I can't be seen wearing that it's 10 years old and a NHS one”

“Do you still have it”

“Yes I need it to wear it to listen to the Radio and TV”

“That's ok so you can  wear it tomorrow, where is it dear”

“I don't want you to see me wearing it James”

June started to cry. “Promise you won't laugh at me and leave”

“Where is it June”

June pointed to the drawer under the TV.

It was good that I had my back to her, I was shocked. I had expected to find a BTE hearing aid, but instead it was a body worn hearing aid with a box and cord and a large white button to push into the ear.
What was I going to say?

I turned and gave her a big smile.

“Come here dear, what's the problem,I expect you wear it I your right ear dear”
“Sit still while I fit it in for you’ do you put the box in your bra like my sister did or you wear it around your waist.”

“I had not planned for what happened next”
