My mother, told me !


I am Sadie, the youngest member, of our family, I have an older sister, Vicky, and a brother Randy
We all are good students, and Randy, a handsome glasses wearing man, is now in his final year, of university, to become an engineer.
Vicky, is taking a nursing course, to be a registered nurse.
I am, taking a business course, to become an accountant, and looking forward, to enter the business world, in a couple of years.


Christmas time, is family time, and both Vicky and Randy, and I will be coming home soon. 
My parents are looking forward, to see all their children home again. 


When, coming home, I was really surprised, when I saw, that both my parents, are
now wearing glasses.
Dad looks very handsome, and studious, wearing his glasses,.
My mother went all out, she is sporting a new hairdo, and hair colour, and I think she looks fantastic, wearing glasses.
When I asked her, why she had not mentioned before, that she is wearing glasses, the answer was, I wanted to surprise you.
Well, she sure did, she looks younger, and I think, better than ever, she looks beautiful.


When, Vicky, and Randy came home, she received the same reaction, from them, as she had received from me, and she loved it.
I noticed, Randy was wearing new glasses, after his last eye exam, I understand, his prescription, has increased again.
I think he looks very handsome, wearing glasses, and I am quite sure, his girlfriend, Cindy, will love his new look.


My mother, likes to have an eggnog party on Christmas eve, because we always have Christmas diner, with the whole family in the community hall, nobody in the family, has a house large enough, for our whole family.


The eggnog party starts, usually after 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when our guests start dropping in to say hello
I love to see, our neighbours and friends, and have a chance to talk to them.
Randy, came home, and brought, his girlfriend Cindy. 
When, I had a chance to talk to her, Cindy seemed kind of nervous, and she asked me, to come with her, to powder our noses, because she wanted my opinion.
We locked the bathroom door, so we had some privacy.
Sadie, I have a problem.
Well, what is your problem?
I have been prescribed to wear glasses, and I don't know, how to tell Randy.
He might not like me wearing glasses.
Do you have the glasses with you,?
Yes, I am supposed to wear, them all the time.
Can I see you wear your glasses? 
Slowly, Cindy, got the glasses case out of her purse, and put her glasses on,
I looked at her, Cindy, I think you look fantastic, and with a little eye make up, you will look stunning, wearing your glasses.
After Cindy, removed her glasses, I applied some make up, and asked her to look at herself. 
You, sure know what you are doing, I never thought, I could be looking this good, wearing glasses.
Cindy, I have an idea, you go and sit on Randy's bed, and I will have a talk with him, and send him up .


I went, and told Randy, I had a big surprise for him, it was in his bedroom, and to go and check it right now.
What did you do to Cindy?
Nothing Randy, just don't get excited, I think, you will love your surprise.
Randy went upstairs to his bedroom, and the two of them, did not come down,
for a while.


When Randy, and the smiling, glasses wearing Cindy, came down, she received many compliments on her new look. 
They both thanked me, Randy, loves Cindy's, glasses wearing look.


The next day, at our family dinner, I noticed, that there sure are, more family members ,wearing glasses now, and how nice most of them, look wearing glasses.
I talked, to some of my nieces, who are wearing glasses now, and even tried to wear some of their glasses, but did not notice, any improvement in my vision, wearing the glasses.


That night, in bed, I recalled all the activities, and all the people, I had talked to, and how, many of them, are wearing glasses now.
I fell asleep, thinking about glasses, and had a dream about glasses, but cannot remember, what happened., and how the dream ended.


My mother, Vicky, and I were having a nice chat, while enjoying a good cup of coffee, when we started to talk about glasses.
Vicky mentioned, she wanted to have an eye exam, before she went back, to her courses. 
Lately, I have noticed, my distance vision is not as good as it has been, and I expect I need to wear glasses.
Mother said, Sadie, you should have an eye exam, you have not had an eye exam for a couple of years, yes, I know, and will go with Vicky.


Mom, how do you like wearing glasses ?
I love wearing glasses, my vision is great, and both dad and I, love our new look.
and I am still surprised, how comfortable glasses are to wear.


To day, I am having my eye exam.
My feelings, are all mixed up, do I really want to wear glasses?
I guess , I have no choice, if I need to wear glasses, I will wear them.
While in the optical store, waiting for Vicky, to come out of the examination room,
I spend the time, trying frames, to see how I would look wearing glasses.
Now, I know, and I am really surprised, how good I can look, when wearing the proper frame.


Vicky, was prescribed to wear glasses, as she had expected.
Now, it was my turn, to have my eye exam.
The exam, went as I had expected, Sadie, your eyes are healthy, and your vision is almost 20/20, I would like to see you again, in a couple of years.


Vicky, had a hard time, selecting a frame, that she liked.
I soon found some some frames, she might like, but she could not make up her mind, which one she liked best.
Then, the optician came, and showed Vicky, what to look for,, regarding, facial features, and colour.
At last, she found a frame she liked, and after the measurements were taken, was told the glasses would be ready, to morrow afternoon.


.
The next day, I went with Vicky, to pick up her glasses.
After, having been fitted, with her new glasses, she looked around, and could not stop telling me, how she could see everything, so nice and clear now, she loved it.
When finally, she looked in the mirror, to see how she looked, loved her new look
.
On the way home while driving in the car, she kept on telling me, about all the things,. she can now see, and how comfortable her glasses are to wear, and how glad she is to have her glasses.
When, we came home, I asked her, if I could try the wonderful glasses.
When she handed me the glasses, and I put them on, could not see to well. 
My mother who was sitting with us, said, Sadie, I am sure you will be next to wear glasses.
Randy, started to wear glasses, when he was 21, Vicky will be 21 in a couple of months, so I figure, in less then 2 years, you will be wearing glasses,
Believe it, or not, but she was right.


I finished my studies in accounting, and now work in the office of a growing business.
In the office, I work, with two other girls, and enjoy my work.


About 6 months later, I started to get more headaches, took some medication, and 
and that was it.
Jenny, one of my co-workers, came to work today, wearing a pair of very stylish glasses.
She looked fantastic wearing glasses, and at our coffee break she told us all about the glasses.
Like me, she had more headaches, and when, she went to see her doctor, 
was advised, to get an eye exam.
She loves, her new glasses, her vision is so much better now, and loves her new look, and that, her boyfriend told her, he loved her new glasses wearing look.
I had a chance to try, her glasses, and when I wore the glasses, and looked around, realized, I better make an appointment, for an eye exam.


I sure was ready, the day I had my eye exam, now I wanted to wear glasses.
After the exam, was finished, I handed my prescription to the optician, and started the search, for a nice glasses frame, so I would look my best, wearing glasses.
When, the optician, came over to help me, we found, what I thought was the perfect frame, that I really liked, for my new glasses.


I cannot recall a time, that I was so excited, as to day, when my glasses were ready.
I sat at the desk, when the optician, opened a nice glasses case, and there were my new glasses. 
She took the glasses out of the case, and gently put them on my face.
and after checking the fit, handed me a mirror, so I could look at my self.
I could not believe, how good I looked, wearing my new glasses, i loved my new look.
When I started to look around, was speechless being able, to see everything so nice and clear, what a miracle, I never had realized, wearing glasses could improve your vision like that.


When, I came home, my mother, and Vicky complimented me, on my new look, and my choice of frame.
Vicky, said to me, do you remember, about 2 years ago, when I started to wear glasses, mother told you, that you would be wearing glasses, in a about 2 years, and she was right. Yes, now I remember, Mother told me I would be wearing glasses.
How did she know?
