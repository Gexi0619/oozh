New glasses for Christmas .



I am a lucky girl, I live in a nice house, have loving parents, and a handsome older brother.
At school I am in grade 5, and I am a good student.
I started wearing glasses about three years ago, and my present prescription is -2.25 for the right, and 
-2.00 for the left eye and a little bit of astigmatism.
I am happy with my glasses, I like to be able to see so well, and like the way I look wearing them.
I have a good friend, Sandy, she lives down the street, we always walk to school together.
Sandy s father died a few years ago, and they live with their grandfather in his house. 
Her mother works but does not make a lot of money.
Sandy is very nearsighted, and should be wearing glasses.
Her grandfather says she does not need glasses,  and her mother cannot afford an eye exam, and buy her glasses right now.
When Sandy was at my place and tried my old glasses, she told me that she can see much better when wearing the glasses. 
I told my mother about Sandy and being able to see much better when wearing my old glasses.
She said, if they help her vision give Sandy the glasses
Sandy is very happy, and wears the glasses all the time.
Lately I have seen Sandy squinting a lot, and she is complaining about having headaches.
She tried the glasses that I am wearing now.  
She told me she can see so much better, wearing my present glasses, that she hated to give them back to me.
I wonder how I can help her.

I am due for an eye exam in early December, if I have a change in prescription, I can give Sandy the glasses I am wearing now, but I don t think they will fix Sandy s vision problem.
I spend some time on the computer and found some places on line that sell glasses.
It is surprising how good their prices are, but the problem is, you need a prescription.
Having studied all the details, I would now be able to order glasses, if I have a prescription.
I wrote all the information down, so I would not forget.
I still have $ 40.00 left in my savings, enough to buy a nice pair of glasses
I think, I might have found a solution to get Sandy proper glasses.
The next time Sandy came over we spend some time on the computer looking at all the frames for glasses that now are available.
We each selected a frame that we liked very much, it was a lot of fun.

Christmas is not to far away, I have done most of my Christmas shopping except for one present.
To morrow I have my eye exam, and I have asked Sandy to come along to keep me company..
Dr. Jones does not sell glasses, he is an optometrist and only examines eyes.
He has looked after our family for many years.
When we walked into his office, Mrs Jones his secretary greeted us.
Ashley, how are you?
You have grown quite a bit since you were here last year.
Thank you Mrs. Jones, I am fine, please meet my friend Sandy.
Soon after, Dr Jones called me into his office.
After the exam was finished, Dr. Jones told me, he was pleasantly surprised that I only had a 1/2 diopter increase in my prescription, since I had grown quite a bit.
Then I got up my nerve, Dr Jones do you ever have a 2 for 1 special?
No, we don t, that is only in the stores where they sell glasses.
Why did you ask?
Well....., so I told him about Sandy, and her poor vision.
Sandy is wearing my old glasses,  because her mother does not have much money to buy her glasses.
I have saved $ 40.00 dollars, enough to buy Sandy a pair of glasses on line for a Christmas present, but I do need a proper prescription, and her P.D 
Mom pays you for my exam and I wonder if you would give Sandy an eye exam to, and we have a two for one.
Well,....... said Dr. Jones, is the young lady here?
Yes she is, please don t tell her, what I told you.
Just tell her you want to check if she is wearing the right glasses.
O.K send her in.

After Dr. Jones was finished with Sandy s eye exam, he called me into his office.
Your friend sure needs a proper pair of glasses.
Her prescription is a diopter higher than yours and she has some astigmatism.
I pulled the information, I had written down for on line ordering from my purse, 
and asked Dr. Jones if he could please  fill out the missing information.
Ashley, do you have a credit card?
No, I don t.
Well if you give me the forty dollars, I will order the glasses for you, and I will ask them to send the glasses to your home.
Thank you Dr. Jones, that is wonderful,  now I am sure that the order will be perfect. 
I gave him a great big kiss, thank you very much for your help.
We wished Doctor and Mrs Jones a very Merry Christmas when we left.
On the way home Sandy told me she liked the exam it was very interesting. 
Dr. Jones had told her that I can wear your next pair of old glasses, when you get your new ones.
I could not believe how well everything worked out, and could not wait for the day that Sandy s new glasses would be delivered.

I showed my mother my new prescription, she took me to the optical store to select a new frame
for my glasses.
When my new glasses were ready and I put them on, noticed again an improvement in my vision.
The next day at school I handed Sandy my old glasses, she immediately put them on, and thanked me, she is so happy with her glasses.

About a week later when I came home from school, my mother handed me a package that had come in the mail.
She asked me if I could tell her what it was. 
I unpacked it and showed her the glasses.
Then I told her what Dr. Jones had done, and that these are Sandy s new glasses, my Christmas gift to her.
Well I think that is very nice, I am very proud of you, and gave me a big kiss.
Of course I had to try the glasses and now realized how poor Sandy s vision really is.

On the day before Christmas I invited Sandy over to help me bake some Christmas cookies.
When she came, I noticed she brought a present that she put under the Christmas tree.
I smiled and could not wait until she would see hers.
I like baking and we had a great time making, baking and decorating cookies.
When it was time for Sandy to go home, I told her that there was a present for her under the tree.
We exchanged presents, Sandy gave me a pair of mittens, that she had knitted for me.
When Sandy opened her present and saw a pair of glasses,  looked them over and put them on.
Ashley, I can see perfect wearing these glasses, thank you so much, these glasses are fantastic.
They look lie the frames we looked at on line.
Then I told her that they are the frame that she liked, with the new prescription from her eye exam at Dr. Jones.
Sandy started to cry and came over and hugged me, thank you Ashley, what a fantastic gift.
I saw my mother wipe a few tears, then she smiled, Merry Christmas everybody.


        Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year to all our members and guests,of VISION and SPEX.
