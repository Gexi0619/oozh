My name is Andrew .
I have 2 sisters , Jennifer who is 15 , and in her second year of high school, and Carol who is 17 and in her last year.
I am the baby of the family, I am just starting high school.
My mother wears glasses , she is myopic and started to wear glasses when she was 14.
All the members of here family wear glasses . and it looks like all their children do to, it seems myopia 
runs in the family.
I expect in a few years  I will have to wear glasses , I like the look of glasses on people and would not mind having to wear glasses, I think glasses are fascinating.
Carol started to wear glasses when she was 15, she likes wearing them .
 She looks real good wearing glasses.
She got her second pair of glasses , after her exam when she was 16, I heard her say that her prescription had increased from - 1.00 to - 1.75.
I borrow her old glasses  once and a while , and enjoy playing with them and pretend they are mine.

We just had our annual eye exam.
Carol had another  increase in her prescription she is now - 2.25.
Jennifer was told she now needed to wear glasses.
Her prescription read - 1.25 for the right and - 1.50 for the left eye and enough  astigmatism that she could not wear contact lenses.
She was furious, she was not going to wear glasses , and was not very fussy when selecting a frame, she was not going to wear them anyway.
I don t have to wear glasses yet, most likely next year.

It was time for Jennifer to get her drivers license .
When she had the vision test , she did not wear her glasses, and of course she failed and was told to come back when she had glasses.
She did not have any choice , and when she went back to take the test put on her glasses.
When she read on her permit , that she had a restriction, and could not drive without wearing glasses , she was mad , it was nobody s business that she needed to wear glasses
At school she always sits in the front of the class and when she misses some of the writing on the 
blackboard , =she always seems to manage  to copy what she missed from someone else.

Lately I have heard Jennifer talking about a very handsome guy in Carol s class, his name is 
Bradley, nd he is on the football team.
I think Jennifer is fantasizing she is in love with him.
When at school I have noticed that she tries to get close to him and be noticed.
I understand that Jennifer was very surprised  and happy when Bradley asked her to be his partner at the next school dance.
Of course she accepted , and I heard her ask our mother if she could please have a new dress for the occasion ,.because everything had to be just right.
The night of the school dance everything was perfect, she sat with Carol and her boyfriend Andrew 
and they all had a good time.
Bradley asked Jennifer for another date and of course she accepted.

Here is Jennifer s story.
Bradley picked me up , and we went to a nice Italian restaurant for dinner , the food was excellent  and it was so romantic.
Bradley is so handsome , well mannered and a real gentleman.
We talked about a lot of different things, to get to know each other  a little better, it was very pleasant evening , and before we knew it , it was time to go home.
At the door he kissed me good night, and asked me for another date .

When Bradley came to get me on our date , he suggested we go and see a movie.
I told him I would like that , I have not been to see a movie for a long time.
We went to the theater  and after we found our seats  we sat down and got settled.
Bradley surprised me when he pulled a glasses case out of his pocket , and put on a pair of glasses.
Now I will be able to see the movie perfectly.
I was very surprised , I did not know Bradley wore glasses.
When I looked at him, I noticed the glasses made him look even better, wow he was handsome.
I really surprised myself liking the look of Bradley wearing glasses
Then I said , I did not know you wore glasses.
Bradley then told me he is slightly myopic , and only wears his glasses when he feels he needs
to wear them ,
He expects that  after his next eye exam , he will have an increase in his prescription, and will be wearing glasses full time.
Another surprise Bradley did not mind wearing glasses.

When the movie started , I found the picture very blurry , and I had to strain to see it.
I realized now I should have worn my glasses, but I did not have them with me , and I sure did not want Bradley see me wearing glasses.
When Bradley asked me how I liked the picture?
I told him I thougt the picture was a little blurry.
The picture looks perfect to me, that is why I wear my glasses,
Why don t you try my glasses , you might notice a difference.
So I put his glasses on , and for sure the picture looked better, but I also realized the prescription on his glasses was not as strong as mine.
Yes, you are right , wearing your glasses made the picture look better.
Jennifer I think you  need to go for an eye exam, I have a feeling you should be wearing glasses , if the picture looks better wearing my glasses.
I know your sister wears glasses, and she looks very nice wearing glasses.
I am sure you will look fantastic wearing glasses
Then he told me how he loves the looks of women wearing glasses.
I was almost in tears when I told him that I had glasses, but was to vain to wear them.
He said Jennifer don t be silly , there is nothing wrong having to wear glasses, and now I am really looking forward to Monday , so I can see how nice you look wearing glasses , because I expect 
you will now wear your glasses going to school.
I had no choice., if I wanted Bradley to be my boyfriend  , I better wear my glasses.
As soon as I came home , I looked for my glasses and put them on.
I had to get the feel of wearing glasses and get used to wearing them
Never had I realized before that guys liked the looks of girls wearing glasses.
All day Sunday I wore my glasses , and every time I looked  at myself in the mirror wearing my glasses, was mad at myself for not choosing a nicer looking frame.
I tried different hairstyles , and make up,to look my best wearing glasses.
Everybody in the house was wondering  what had happened to me , because I was wearing my glasses now.
I was very nervous when Monday came, because nobody at school knew I had glasses.
When I got to school, I soon realized nobody really cared that I wore glasses .
I received a few compliments, and now realized that since so many of the students wore glasses, wearing glasses was no big deal.
Later that day Bradley and I met in the lunch room, and he complimented me on my  looks.
He told me I look fantastic wearing glasses ,and expected me wearing my glasses all the time, and I told him I would.
Now I realize how foolish I had been refusing to wear glasses .
My vision is so much better now, the glasses are comfortable to wear , and I am starting to get used to see myself wearing them.
Now I am even looking forward to my next eye exam, and the chance to pick out a stunning looking frame so I will look fantastic wearing glasses.

That was Jennifer s story.
So Jennifer wore her glasses full time now, all because of a boyfriend.
At the next eye exam I was prescribed glasses m asI had expected and always wanted.
Carol had another increase in her prescription
Jennifer also had an increase in her prescription, but she told me she did not mind that at all.
She selected a real nice looking frame and could not wait to get them
Jennifer is so happy now with her new glasses , shew now loves wearing glasses and believe it or not, will now not be seen without wearing glasses
I just cannot believe that when a girl meets a boy she likes , can change from hating to wear glasses, to love wearing glasses in such a short time.
to love wearing glasses
