description: A physicist's love story takes a bitter turn as he seeks solace in a new pair of glasses.

Hello everybody! I am following this page for some time. Now it is time for my story. I hope you enjoy reading it.

After I left school, I started to study physics. This specialty was always fascinating me. I finished my studies and today I am a PhD student working intensively on my dissertation to become a doctor of physics. As many colleagues I am really dependent on my glasses which I wear since I am 5 years old. My parents noticed that I have some difficulties to recognize objects in some distance. Then – this is what I can remember – when I got my first pair of glasses, I really started to discover the world on a new level. And I am doing this until now.
I always felt some attraction to women that have a similar high – or better: higher prescription. You know, what I am talking about.
Luckily I met a girl, Steffi, in my first year of study that had such a similar high prescription and we started to learn together. After a while we had some dates and we got a nice, myopic couple. I told her about my “preferences” and she replied the same. We compared our prescriptions and found that we are both around the -10 level – with slight differences.
As a physicist one needs to appear stereotypic – this is what we thought. So we both ordered the same model of such “nerdy wayfarer” glasses from a well known company. Of course the lenses were really thick, but our matching appearance was great.
Sometimes it happened that we mixed our glasses. I remember several times when we took a shower together: We both placed our glasses beside the sink. When we grabbed them afterwards we sometimes experienced a blurred image. It was the nicest feeling to switch them and see your partner crystal-clear again with nothing more than the glasses. No need to write more…
This continued now for several years. We kept the “tradition” and always wore the exact same glasses (frames). Until recently these have been classical round metal glasses with thin arms in black color.
We both graduated as master of science and we searched for a place to make the doctors degree.
Steffi was interested in going to another country and doing it there, but I wanted to stay in my home country. This was the time our arguments started… everything seemed perfect, but now we had more and more problems. I found my way to make my doctors degree at the same university, but she was not successful. So she decided to work for our department and continue searching for a place.
2 month ago she finally found her way and she really left our place. At that point we split up. The problems of the last year have created such a tension that this event was the ignition of the bomb.
Now I was alone again – I missed her, but it was too late. I missed our glasses game, I missed her during breakfast, I missed our scientific discussion, …
1 month ago I decided that I would be easier for me to “forget” about her when I change my glasses style. So I went to my glasses store and picked a nice plastic frame with 52mm wide glasses in rectangular shape. They fitted my prescription L -9.5 -1.0 178 and R -10.5 -1.5 186 and 5 days later I was called to pick them up. I liked my new appearance and I felt the release of some emotions.
Now the main story begins.
Two weeks ago I wanted to drive home from university. After we split up I had to find a new apartment which fitted my budget. This was more distant to my institute and I use to take the streetcar to reach it in the morning and to go home in the evening.
Everything seemed normal. I had a good day in my institute and it was time to go home.
As usual I approached the train station. It is such an underground station and one needs to go downstairs. When I reached the underground level I noticed that the train was arriving. At that late time the station is nearly empty and the trains are coming less frequent. I wanted to get it. I was moving faster and unfortunately I slipped and fell down just close to the railway. My new glasses have been sliding down the nose all the time – I wanted to adjust it, but as usual I postponed it.
So the glasses left my face and fell down on the rails. I realized what happened, stood up and before I could do anything the train approached. It was an awful sound… just by chance the glasses landed somehow exactly on the rails and were smashed by the train. I immediately realized that it would make no sense to wait for the next train and search for my glasses in between. So I carefully went into the train without seeing anything.
Then I had the idea!
I grabbed my phone from my pocket, switched it on and opened the camera.
I thought:
A myopic can see things near to his eyes and the camera can focus on distance.
I put the display near to my eyes and: YES. I was able to perceive my environment again.
It was so good that I continued to hold my screen “in” my face. Some people started looking at me, but I didn’t care. 
After some minutes I spotted a young lady who approached me, sat down on the opposite to me, greeted me and asked what I am doing. I was a little bit confused, but I started to tell her – still holding the phone “in” my face in order to see her – that I lost my glasses and that this is the way I can see. She seemed to be excited and immediately told me that she experienced a similar situation, but she didn’t came up with that idea. She told me that she expected me to be nearsighted, as nobody would be able to focus at that short distance at which I was – still – holding the phone.
We continued talking and figured out that she had to leave the train one station after me.
We shared our phone number and when it was time, I left the train.
I headed home without any problems thanks to the camera and at home I had my old pair of metal-frame glasses that were the same prescription.
The next day was normal for me again. I went to university. At lunch time I got a Whatsapp mail.
It was the girl from last evening. She asked me, if I would like to meet her in the evening and I agreed. I suggested to go to a bar which we both knew.
I took the train – without any incidence – and reached the bar at the proper time. After some minutes the girl appeared – wearing her glasses instead of contacts. We introduced each other and then the girl – Sarah – told me that she is about -7 in both eyes, but she doesn’t know so much about the topic. For her it is just normal. We found out that we are both at the same university, but she studies the law to become a lawyer. She will graduate after one year.
From that time on we started to go out every evening and we seemed to like each other pretty much. We were laughing a lot and just had nice evenings.
Yesterday I invited her for a romantic dinner and afterwards we proceeded to my place.
It is true – without losing my new glasses and without my idea of using the phone’s camera, I wouldn’t have Sarah now.
