description: "Sarah's life takes an unexpected turn when she realizes she needs glasses, bringing new perspectives and challenges."
---
Sarah is my name, I graduated last spring, and now am a registered nurse, and work in our local hospital.
I am happy with myself, I have a good job, and like my looks. I have a nice head of wavy hair, that I am very proud of, and a steady boy friend.
Life is good, I love my job, I like being a nurse,


Last night, Kevin and I went to see a movie, he wanted to sit a little closer to the front, I agreed, I find the picture a little fuzzy, sitting further back. 
We enjoyed our night out, and looking forward to our next date.


I am working the night shift to day, and are all rested up for my 12 hour shift.
When I came to work, I realized, my co worker to night is Alexandria, [ Alex]
a very pleasant person, and easy to work with.
When I saw her, I noticed she is wearing glasses now, wow! she looks great wearing glasses, and I complimented her on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
She thanked me, for the compliment, and we did not have time, for any more conversation, having to get our patients ready for the night.
After I had all my patients, settled for the night, went to the nurses station,
to do my paperwork. 
When I was almost finished, Alex came in and joined me.
After she finished her work, we had a chance to talk, and she told me how surprised she had been, when the optometrist had told her, that she needed to wear glasses.
Evidently her younger sister, who is still in high school, applied for her drivers license, did not pass the vision test, and her mother, who is myopic, thought it was time for Alex, to have her eyes examined again, while her sister went for the eye exam.
That is the reason, I had an eye exam, and now, I realize, I sure need to wear glasses, I cannot believe the improvement in my vision.
Last night we went to see a movie, and I sat way towards the back of the theater, and the picture was perfect, I am sure glad, I have to wear glasses now.
What is it like, having to wear glasses?
Well, I find the glasses comfortable to wear, I can see so much better now, and I am really starting to like the way I look, wearing glasses,


After Alex, had mentioned, where he wanted to sit, when watching the movie,, I realized, I also, have to sit closer to the front, to see the picture nice and clear.
I have not had an eye exam for years, perhaps I should have one, my vision might not be as good, as I think it is.
When, I mentioned it to Alex, she mentioned, perhaps I should be wearing glasses, and asked me, if I would like to try her glasses.
Yes, I would like to.
After she handed me her glasses, I put them on, looked around, and could not believe the improvement in my vision, was my vision that poor?
Alex you might be right, I think, I need to wear glasses, what an improvement in my vision,, wearing your glasses, and you are right, the glasses feel very comfortable. I better make arrangements for a proper eye exam.
How do I look wearing glasses?
You will be looking great, I like the way you look wearing my glasses.


The next day, I arranged for an eye exam, and now I am anxious to find out, do I need to wear glasses. 
When I saw Kevin on our next date, I told him why I am having an appointment for an eye exam, and that I expected, I would be prescribed to wear glasses.
Sarah, I don't like the looks of women who wear glasses, you will have to get contact lenses.
I was not to happy with Kevin's reaction, well time will tell, first things first, and that was my eye exam. 


When I went for my eye exam, I enjoyed the experience more, than my previous exams, because I had many question, and the optometrist explained , what he did, and why he did it.
At the end of the exam, the doctor showed me the difference I would see when wearing glasses, and when not wearing glasses, now I cannot wait to get my glasses.
Selecting a suitable frame, was fun, and it took me some time to make a decision.
I discussed with the optician, about getting contact lenses.
She suggested, I wear the glasses for a while, and to see if I needed any change in my prescription, before I decided on contact lenses.
When my glasses were ready, and I put them on, loved my improved vision and my new look, just as well, because I am not really, very exited about wearing contact lenses.


I now cannot stop looking at myself, I love my glasses look, I feel more professional, and confident, and I have received lots of compliments, how nice I look wearing glasses., now I wonder what Kevin has to say.


When Kevin came to get me for our date, and I opened the door, he looked at me, and the first thing he said, you did not get contact lenses.
Kevin, I will tell you all about it later, I am ready to go.
I could tell Kevin was not very happy, he did not say much.
When we entered the mall, to go to see a movie, we met some high school days friends, and I received more compliments how nice I looked wearing glasses.
On of the girls even said, if I could look that good wearing glasses, I sure would like to wear them.
Later, I told Kevin why I did not get contact lenses, perhaps in about 6 months.
I know Kevin was all upset, but we went to see the movie, and when we did some kissing, I took my glasses off, but it certainly was not one of our better dates.


During our next few dates, my glasses did not seem to upset Kevin anymore, he must be getting used to my glasses look.
About a month later, when Kevin came to get me for our evening out, he was not in a very good mood.
I asked him, if I could help him.
Sarah, I am very upset, to day I went to get my drivers license renewed, and I had to take a vision test, and you know my eye sight is almost perfect, and when the lady finished the test, she told to come back, when I was wearing my glasses, then they would renew my license.
Now, I have to go for a vision test, and I don't know where to go, I never needed an eye exam.
Well Kevin, we go to the mall, there is a good optical store, where I bought my glasses, and make an appointment for you, to have an eye exam.
So we went to the optical store, to make an appointment.
After Kevin, made his appointment, I suggested, that since we were here, he try some frames, I would like see what he would look like wearing glasses.
I am pretty sure, that with your good vision, you most likely will not be prescribed to wear glasses.
The optician, who had heard our conversation, suggested she would show him some frames, he might like, in case he needed to wear glasses.
Having Kevin try frames, was the most sexually, exciting, experience, I had in a long time.
He would look fantastic wearing glasses, now, I could not wait, for him to start wearing glasses. 
The optician, kept on telling Kevin, how fantastic he would look wearing glasses, all I said which frame I liked best.
The biggest surprise I had all night, when on the way home, Kevin said, I did not know, I could look that good wearing glasses.
On our next date, when Kevin came to get me, he was wearing his new glasses, and I told him, he looked fantastic, and took him into the house to show my parents, who complimented him on his new look.
We went to see a movie that night, sitting toward the back of the theater so we could appreciate our improved vision.
When we had some refreshments after the show, Kevin, told me he was sorry, You do look beautiful wearing glasses, I never knew, wearing glasses could improve your vision that much ,and at the same time make you look attractive, and even give you a more mature and mature look.
Sarah, please forgive me, I changed my mind, glasses are great, and look terrific, I am glad we both wear glasses.
