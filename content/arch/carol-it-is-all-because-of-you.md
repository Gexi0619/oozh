Carol, it is all, because of you !


Amy, is my name, I feel very fortunate, to grow up in a music loving family, because, I love music.
My mother plays the piano, my dad the clarinet, and my older brother Logan, plays the piano, but, I know he rather play sports.
I play both the piano, and the violin, but my preference is the violin.
I have been playing the violin, for about eight years now, and since I am going to start high school, after the summer, I am looking forward, for a chance, to play in the school orchestra,
I have grown quite a bit this year, and I am very pleased, the way my body is developing, all the curves, are in the right places, I feel like a young women now.
With my nice brown eyes and dark blond hair, I feel really good about myself.
My best friend is Carol, who likes to draw and paint, is a very artistic, she has done some very nice work, and won some prizes at art shows., and I think, she is a very attractive young lady, we have been friends for a long time.


The new school year has started, and there are thirteen girls and twelve boys in our class, some I don't even know, because they came from other schools. 
Leave it to Carol, to come up with her new findings. 
She mentioned to me, that five of the thirteen girls, and four of the twelve boys, are wearing glasses, and that she is really surprised how nice, and more mature, and attractive, most of them look wearing glasses.
I was surprised, I had never paid much attention, to what a glasses wearing person really looked like.
Amy, I really, like the looks of glasses, and I now wondering, how good I would look, wearing glasses, what do you think?
I don't know, I think the only way you will to find out is, for you to wear a pair of glasses, so you can have a good look at your self.
You are right, and I just thought of it, you gave me a real good idea, if you are not busy Saturday, we can go to the optical store in the mall, and try some glasses frames, and that way, we can find out, what we will look like wearing glasses.
Sure, I will go with you, that might be fun.


After I had done some of my chores around the house, and played some music, 
I dressed to go to the mall, with Carol.
While we rode on the bus, Carol asked me, to look at some of the people, who wore glasses, and she wanted my opinion. 
I now, start to realize that some people look really nice wearing glasses, and I now started to wonder how well, they would be able to see, without wearing their glasses, and I also noticed that the lenses in glasses, all seemed to look different
I mentioned that to Carol, yes I know, some persons are nearsighted, they call it myopic, and other persons, are farsighted or hyperopic, I found that out, when I was searching about vision on the computer. 
When we arrived at the mall, we enjoyed looking, at all the store windows, on our way to the optical store.
When we entered the optical store, a very pleasant lady greeted us, Carol who is never stuck for words, told her that she had an eye exam coming up, and was pretty sure, she would be prescribed glasses, and would like to try some of the frames. 
The lady said, please, ,come this way, where she showed us some frames, that she is sure would look good on Carol, 
When another customer came in, she excused herself, and left us trying the frames
I did not realize, how much fun it was, we try a frame, and then look at ourselves, and we look at each other, while taking some pictures. 
I now realize, to my surprise, that I look real good wearing some of the frames, and now wonder, if perhaps, I would like having to wear glasses. 
Carol, loves the way she looks wearing glasses, and she is going to ask her parents, to have an eye exam, she wants to wear glasses.


The following week at school we had try outs, for the orchestra.
When my turn came up, the teacher, after having me play one tune, placed in front of me, on the music stand, a piece of music, I had never seen before, and he asked me to play it.
When I looked at it, it looked all fuzzy, and I had to get closer, so I could read the music.
I have noticed lately, that I have to get closer, to be able to read the music, on the stand, do I need glasses?


To day my brother came home, and told us that he had passed the exam for his beginners license, and all he needed to do go to the license office to take his pass marks and money, and he would get his beginners license.


A few days later, after school., Logan went to the license office, with his passing marks.
After filling out the paper work, that was required, the lady asked him, to sit down in front of a machine.
Now, we will do the vision test, Logan sat down, no worry, until he realized, he had trouble reading the letters.
The lady told him, to come back, when he was wearing his glasses, before he could get his license


Carol to day, came to school, wearing her new glasses, she loves them, she had not realized, that she was slightly myopic.
She looks fantastic wearing glasses, and received many compliments.
When she let me try her glasses, I noticed some improvement in my vision, and now realize, I most likely need to wear glasses.


Logan, was in a bad mood, when he came home, and told his parents, all about his big problem, flunking the vision test.
My dad told him, that all he had to do, have an eye exam, and then get a note from the optometrist, that is all you need, your vision is good.
My mother told him, she book an appointment for him, when my dad suggested, that perhaps, I should have an eye exam to, I did not object, I am almost sure I need to wear glasses. 


When the day of the exam came, I was almost looking forward, to be told, that I need to wear glasses.
Carol is so happy with her glasses and looks fantastic, and I have looked at the pictures on my phone, and think I might like the glasses wearing look.
Logan , had his eye exam first, and sure was not happy, when he was told, with his 
astigmatism, and being myopic, needed to wear his glasses full time.
When I had my exam, which I found very interesting, the doctor at the end showed me, what I would see with, and without wearing glasses, I could not believe the difference, I had not realized, my vision had been that poor.
My prescription read, O.D . -1,50, O.S. -1.25, and some astigmatism.
When I came out of the examination room, Logan told me that his glasses were being made up,.
It did not take me long, to find to find the frame I liked, and the optician told me , my glasses would be ready in about an hour.
Logan and I, went to get some refreshments, while waiting for our glasses to be made, and I had to listen to all his complaints.


Finally it was time, for us to return to the optical store, to pick up our glasses.
Logan, sat down, and I looked while the optometrist adjusted his glasses, just seeing a little, I think Logan, is going to look very nice wearing glasses.
When I sat down, my stomach was full of butterflies, my own new glasses.
After the optician was finished, and I had a chance to look around, could not believe, he improvement in my vision, and now realize, I sure needed to wear glasses.
I complimented Logan, on his new look, but did not get any response.




When, we arrived home, our parents could not believe, that we both needed to wear glasses, and told us, we sure looked different, but had made a good
choice of frames. 


The next day at school, when Carol tried my glasses, could not believe, that my prescription was that much stronger then hers.
Amy, I think we went at the right time to look at glasses frames.
Yes I agree, and Carol,, it is all because of you, we both wear glasses now.
