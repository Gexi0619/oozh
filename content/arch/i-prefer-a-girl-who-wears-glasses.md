I prefer a girl who wears glasses!




Hi, I am Nicole, I am 19 years old, I live on a farm, and now have graduated from high school. 
I am planning to go to the city, and take a business course, so I might get a good job., there are no jobs around here.
I am medium tall, well build girl, have nice, dark blonde, long hair, an a nice rather large chest, and I think a decent figure, and I wear glasses, because I am myopic.
When I started to wear glasses, my so called boy friend dumped me, he told me I looked bad enough without glasses and he can do better than me , 
I am not sot sorry at all, come to think of it, he sometimes, even treated me like a cow, so much for guys, I don't care if, I ever get one.
I like wearing glasses, I like the looks of them, they are comfortable, and I can see properly.
Now I have to get ready for my move, to the city, I am supposed to stay with my aunt Irene.
She is my father's oldest sister, I met her once, and at that time,I was not impressed, and I know, they don"t have any children..
I am also told to be very nice of her, because she is going to board you as a favor .


The big day came, my dad is drove me to the bus station, and I have been told to behave myself, and a whole lot of other things.
The bus was on time, I said goodbye to my dad, and entered the bus.
I looked out of the window, but did not really see anything, because I am all the butterflies in my stomach.
What to expect? going to a city, boarding with an old aunt, trying to get a job, and a lot of other things.


My aunt was waiting for me, when I got of the buss., she sure did not look anything , like I remembered..
She knew me, because my mother. had sent her a picture of me, before I started to wear glasses.
The first thing she said, I almost missed you, I did not know you wore glasses, a young girl like you should not need to wear glasses, only older people need to wear glasses.


When we arrived, at aunt Irene's home, I had a good look, and saw a very nice well looked after garden, with a lot of flowers, and a neat well kept home.
Aunt Irene showed me my room, and told me that we have to share the bathroom, and how much she would charge, for boarding me.
The house was plain and simple, nothing fancy.
After a light lunch, I decided to go and look around town, and find the college where they offered the business course.


Roaming around town, on my way to the college ,to get all the information, I walked past a lawyer's office, which had a sign in the window, office help wanted.
I did not hesitate, and walked in, the receptionist greeted me.
I mentioned I had seen the sign, and would like to apply for the position.
She asked me, to sit down, and fill out a form, and she would call Mr. Peters to see me. 
After filling out the form, and double checking it, Mr. Peters came in, and asked me to come to his office.
After the interview, he told me, he would like me to start the next day, and I told him I would. 
I was so happy to have a job. ,
Mr. Peters suggested, I take the legal business, night course, and also gave me directions to get to the college.
Well, I have a job, and will have some money coming in
I had no problem to find the college, and signed up for the night course.
When I got back, aunt Irene could not believe, that I had a job already.


I had no real problems, with doing the work I was supposed to do, and now know, why Mr. Peters had suggested, I take the legal business course.
I enjoyed my job, and also learning a lot, about the legal business.
Every Tuesday and Thursday night I go to my business night class, and I enjoy it a lot.
I have sure met a lot of nice people there, but there is one girl in my class I really like.
She is new in town like I am, she has been in town, a little longer then me, and we both are enjoying, each others company, and we soon became real close friends. 
Amy is a pleasant looking girl, with a good figure and a nice head of hair.
Last Saturday we went to the mall together, did some shopping, and saw a movie, and she likes to sit near the front, we had a great day.


I cannot figure it out, but all I can think off , lately, is Amy, why, I don"t know, there are lots of guys around , but I really could not care less, why do I prefer girls?


Amy complained about having headaches, after she comes home from work, I suggested she should consider, to get an eye exam.
She did not think her vision, was the problem.
Amy, can you read that sign across the street?
What sign? 
So, I pointed where she should be looking, and she told me she could see the sign, but not what it said.
Well, you should not have any problem reading it, would you like to try my glasses?
Why not, so I handed her my glasses and after she put them on, said,
Nicole, I can"t believe it, I can now read the sign, and I think you are right, perhaps I should go for an eye exam.
Now, I am all excited, Amy is going to wear glasses, and will look even better, I think I love that girl. 


I went with Amy, to the optical shop, and was all excited.
Amy had her eye exam, and like I expected, was prescribed to wear glasses, because she is myopic.
I could not believe, that I was feeling wetness between my legs, when Amy was trying frames, she will be looking great wearing glasses.
Finally, we agreed on a frame, that would look just right, and Amy took it to the optician, and after measurements were taken, she was told the glasses, would be ready, the next day. 


I did not see Amy wearing her new glasses, until the next night when we went to class.
Amy looks fantastic, wearing glasses, but I had to wait till classes were finished, before I could really 
talk to her.
Amy you look fantastic wearing gasses, yes Nicole, I am so happy to have them, I like the way I look, wearing my new glasses, and they sure improved my vision 
We decided to go, .and have a snack, and went to a little restaurant, where we settled in a booth.
After ordering, I at last had a real change to ask Amy, more questions, about how she liked her glasses.
Nicole. I love my glasses, I still can't believe, the improvement in my vision, and I love my new look.
We exchanged glasses, and I noticed, Amy's glasses lenses were a little stronger then my original prescription.
I could not believe, how aroused I got from trying the glasses, and grabbed Amy's hand, and held it resting on my leg.
Not long after Amy moved her hand, close to my private part, I loved the experience.
Later on lying in my bed, I wondered what had happened to me, I only seem to like girls, and glasses
I cannot figure out, why a girl who, wears glasses, make me feel the way I do.
Glasses, is what is on my mind, I realize after trying Amy's new glasses, that I am due, for an increase in my prescription, and because of my work, I now have insurance, that will pay for a new pair of glasses, I also like the idea of a stronger prescription
I like the looks of rings in myopic lenses., I hope my next pair of glasses will show some rings.


To day I had my eye exam, and I am so happy, my prescription has increased to OD.-3.00, OS. -3.25, and some astigmatism.
I just love my new glasses, I can see some rings in the lenses, and I am very happy how I look , wearing the new frames.
Amy, loved my new look, and told me I look good enough to be kissed, well what are you waiting for ?So we kissed, and I loved it.


Because both Amy, and I, were at a boarding house, she suggested, that we might be happier, when we move into a nice apartment, just for the two of us. all we really need is, one bedroom ,a bathroom and a kitchen. 
We found a nice cozy apartment, and now, I have to explain to my aunt Irene, and my family, why want to move., 
I knew aunt Irene would not agree, and she told me, she would talk to my mother about it.
That did not bother me, they already know.
It did not take Amy, and me to get settled, we bought some second hand furniture, and other things we needed and we were both ready, for our big move. 


I will never forget our first night in the apartment, we had pizza , and a bottle of wine for supper, because we did not have any dishes, and cookware.
We sat on the sofa, and while watching television, did some necking and kissing.
That night I experienced my first orgasm. 
So now you know, why, I prefer a girl who wears glasses.
