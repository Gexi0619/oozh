I now have a job, and benefits


My mother is a single parent, I [Ashley] never knew my father.
I will be finishing high school this summer, and have to get a job, we cannot afford higher education for me.
My mother is not in good health, and there are rumors about her job.
I feel it is my duty to help out and make things a little easier for her.
About two years ago I started a part time job working at our grocery Super Store.
It is a good job, I like it very much, but because all the full time staff are unionized, it is only when an opening comes up that you might get a chance to get full time.
So I am looking for a full time job, preferable with some benefits.

Kelley is my dear friend.
We met when we started high school, and are like sisters.
Kelley s dad has a real good job, and the family is well off.
During our second year in high school Kelley started to wear glasses.
She told me the prescription is  -1.00, and I am told might get stronger at my next exam.
I think she looks fantastic wearing glasses, I love the look of her eyes behind the lenses.
Since Kelley had some self improvement courses,  I think she is an expert applying make up, she always looks great.
I have tried Kelley s glasses and was surprise how well I could see wearing them, and when Kelley 
did my make up, I was surprised how good I look wearing her glasses.
Last year Kelley got new glasses.
She loves her new glasses, and she looks fantastic wearing them
I tried her new glasses, but they are to strong for me.
Well I have more important things then glasses to think about right now.

We both graduated with honors, now is the time for me to look for a job.
I am getting extra hours of work at the grocery store because of the summer holidays, which is great, and that gives me more time to look for a full time job.

Kelley is helping me with searching for jobs on her computer.
There are not very many full time jobs available theses days.
We spend quite a bit of time making up a good resume, to show my qualifications to use for
job applications.
I like to get an office or high class retail store job.
Since I work so many more hours now, I have not to much time looking for jobs.
Kelley promised me she will keep searching the computer to see if any good jobs come available. 
She will forward the resume we worked on, if she thinks it is the kind of job I am looking for.

To get ready to go to college Kelley had another eye exam, she told me her prescription is now 
-2.50 for the right and -2.75 for the left eye, her new glasses will be ready in a few days. 

When I saw Kelley she mentioned to me that she now has a pretty good idea, what employers look
for when they have an interview with an applicant for the job.
They like to see a studious, smart looking young women
Then she asked me how I like the new picture on the far wall.
When I told her I could not see it very well, she said I expected that.
She went to her dresser drawer, and took out a glasses case.
Here put these glasses on, can you see it now?
When I told her I could see it, said just like I expected, you need to wear glasses!
I looked around wearing the glasses and told her, I think you are right, I can see everything clearly now.
I had not realized my vision had deteriorated that much, what will I do now?
Well wear the glasses, I don t need them anymore, you remember they were my first pair.
I can t believe it, I need to wear glasses now to see properly. 
Kelley then told me that she had read about a survey, that applicants to jobs who wore glasses had a better chance on getting the job.
So now you can feel better about having to wear glasses, wearing glasses might help you get a job.
Lately I had noticed you squinting more often, so I suspected you needed to wear glasses, and it seems I am right.
Kelley you are such a wonderful friend, I don t know how to thank you.

When walking home wearing my new glasses enjoyed seeing everything I looked at so nice and clear.
The glasses are comfortable to wear, I think I might like wearing glasses.
When I came home and my mother saw me, asked me about the glasses. 
After she listened to the whole story, agreed Kelley was a wonderful friend, and I should wear the glasses, you look more mature and very attractive wearing glasses.
I wore my glasses the next day at work, and received many compliments.
After my first full day of wearing glasses, decided I love wearing glasses, and glad to have them.

A couple days later I got a phone call from Kelley she wanted to see me right away.
When I got there, she told me I had two job interviews.
The first one for a receptionist, to fill in for an employee on pregnancy leave.
The second one for the optical store at the mall, as an assistant to the optician.
Kelley even had scheduled appointments for me, one at 11 o,clock and the on for the optical store at 1 o,clock the next day.

The next day I dressed carefully, put on some make up and glasses and loved the way I looked, when I looked in the mirror.
The gentleman who interviewed me for the receptionist position, told me he was very impressed with my resume and complimented me on my looks, and told me since he had more candidates to interview,
would be in touch with me.
In the afternoon walking into the optical store, I knew right away I would love to work there.
The interview went well, the money was good, and because it was part of a chain, had benefits,
When the interview was finished the gentleman told me I was the last applicant and the best he had interviewed, the job was mine.
I did not hesitate excepting the position, to start the following Monday.
I am in seventh heaven, I have a job.

When I cam home my mother was so happy.
I phoned the gentleman from the first job interview to tell him I had excepted another position.
He told me he was sorry to hear it, the job would have been mine.
Then I went to see Kelley to tell her and thank her for all her help, and most of all to make me a glasses wearing person.
When I got to Kelley s place could not believe my eyes she was wearing her new glasses, I loved the look of her stronger lenses, and told her how nice she looks.
After I told her all my news, of course had to try her new glasses, they looked so nice on me, but the lenses were a little too strong.
She handed me her old glasses and told me I could have them, you most likely need that prescription pretty soon anyway.
I put them on and was surprised how well I could see wearing them, just a little strong.
After I wore them for a while had no problem seeing everything nice and clear,
Kelley, what shall I do? 
Well if you can see properly wearing the glasses, wear them, you look fantastic.
I looked at myself in the mirror, the frames were almost identical, but I loved the look of the stronger lenses, so decided to keep wearing them.
It only took me a couple of days, and my vision was perfect.
Wearing glasses have made me sure feel more confident.
Nobody seem to notice that I was wearing a slightly different frame with stronger lenses, which was just fine with me, I did not have to answer any questions.

The big day arrived, I started my new job.
After I was introduced to the staff, I would be working with, and a tour around the place, the optician
Carol, an older glasses wearing lady, asked me to dust the displays, so I get familiar with the frames we carry.
Then she handed me a card which showed the shape of faces and the type of frame that would look best, for the shape of the face, to help customers select the frame that would look best on them, and asked me to study it.
It did not take me long to match peoples facial features with a pair of frames that would look good.
I loved my job, I had never realized eyeglasses were so exciting.
A little while later Carol taught me to check lenses on the glasses coming from the lab, with the prescription on the lensometer to check they are correct.
I go from one experience to the next, and learn more about vision and glasses all the time.
Another one of my jobs now is to do the patients pre exam procedures.
The print out of the auto refractor, the puff of air from the tonometer, to check the eye presure. 
And if the patients wear glasses, I check their prescription on the lensometer.
I always enjoy the reaction I get with the puff of air when checking the eye pressure.

Time goes fast, I have now been working at the optical store for 6 months.
I had a performance interview and my boss is very satisfied.
I got a raise and a free eye exam and pair of glasses.
My present glasses prescription is 1.75 for the right and -200 for the left eye.
I am looking forward to my eye exam and hope I get an increase, I love the looks of stronger lenses.

After my exam, the optometrist discussed her findings with me .
She asked me how I like wearing glasses.
When I told her I love wearing them, and expecting an increase in my prescription.
She told me you will, you now have some astigmatism, and also an increase of 1 diopter on both eyes.
When I got my new glasses sure noticed the change, it took me about a week to get used to astigmatism correction, and the extra diopter., but love the look of my new lenses.

As expected my mother lost her job, the business was closing.
When she wondered what to do, I suggested she get the place ready for boarding a person.
You are a good cook, and it will keep you busy, and give you some income.
When I was at work I mentioned to Carol,  that if she heard of anyone needing a boarding place, my mother will take a boarder now.

Kelley and I got together after she finished her first year.
When she saw my new glasses of course had to try them, and realized my glasses are a little stronger than hers now.
Then she told me she has a girl friend, and they are rooming together, and they just love each other.
I congratulated her and told her, no matter what we always will be friends.

Carol the optometrist asked me if I would like to be fitted with contact lenses.
That way you know more about them if customers ask.
You always try new frames when they come in to see what they look like when you wear them.
If you wear contact lenses you can wear different frames whenever you want, and be able to see properly.
So Carol fitted me with contact lenses, taught me how to insert and remove them, and how to look after them properly.
It did not take me long to be comfortable wearing the lenses. 

Our optometrist was going to be transferred to another branch.
We are told to expect the new optometrist very soon.
A few days later when I was wearing my contact lenses and trying some new frames, a handsome, glasses wearing guy came in.
He walked over to Carol and was talking to her.
Wow he is a handsome, just the kind of guy I am looking for.
Carol who had seen my reaction, took the gentleman to the examination room.
I had no idea he was our new optometrist.
After a while they came back, and Carol introduced me to Dr, Logan James our new optometrist.
I shook hands with him.
He asked me if I wore no prescription glasses all the time.
So I told him I wore contact lenses while trying new frames to see what they looked like.
He smiled at me, I think you like wearing glasses, you look fantastic wearing the frames.
I had never met a man, who gave me the feeling that went through my body at that moment.
After I recovered said, Yes, I am a happy glasses wearer.

After work when I came home, my mother came to greet me with a big smile on her face.
Ashley, we now have a boarder, a handsome young man.
Yes you were right, I am going to enjoy the extra work, he will be down to have supper with us.
What a surprise when I saw who our boarder was, Logan our optometrist.
Hi, Ashley I did not expect to see you, Carol suggested your mothers place for a place to board.
I am glad she did, I like the room, and by the smell of it your mother is a good cook.
Eating our meal was more enjoyable than ever, looking across the table at such a handsome man.
That night in bed I was so jittery, I had a hard time going to sleep, after I got satisfied fell asleep dreaming about Logan.

A few days later when I went to the bathroom, noticed a pair of very strong myopic glasses.
I guessed the prescription to be at least -15.00.
I tried them on, everything I looked at was distorted.
Curiosity got the best of me, and at supper that night asked Logan about the glasses.
Those are the glasses  I wear, when I do glasses over contacts.
I love doing it, the vision you get is so exciting and I love to walk around and people looking at my thick lenses.
Let me know when you would like to try it, I guarantee, you will love the experience.
We discussed the G O C some more, and he told me he will check my prescription and figure out the 
right combination, so I can try it.

About a week later he asked me to come to his room.
When I got there he handed me a pair of contact lenses, after I got the lenses in place he handed me a pair of glasses and told me to put them on.
What an experience to look through lenses that strong.
I walked over to the window and looked out, everything seems to look smaller and further away,
but so well defined, I loved it.
When I looked in the mirror and saw the rings in the lenses, and how small my eyes looked, loved the look.
What an experience.
Logan in the meantime had inserted his contacts and put on his -22.00 glasses, and asked me if I was ready to go for a walk.
How exciting, no wonder he loves doing G O C, it is addictive.
We walked to the park and sat on a bench enjoying the scenery, when Logan bent over and gave me a kiss, sorry, I should not have, but you look so nice in your – 15.00 glasses I could not resist it.


That night lying in bed as so worked up, that I went into Logan s room, and seduced him.
Everything fell into place after that, Logan and I are going to get married.
How lucky I was to get a good job with benefits, thanks Katie for helping me get that job.
