Is the glasses wearing fetish, contagious?.

Charlene, is in her last year of high school, then it is me, Ashley, I am now in my second year of high school, and then my youngest sister Megan, who will be starting high school next year.
Both Charlene, and Megan's looks, are very similar,
They both have beautiful black hair, brown eyes, and nice oval shaped faces.
Charlene, is a well developed, tall girl, wit a very nice figure.
Megan, I am sure, is going to look as beautiful as her sister.
My looks are entirely different, my face is more square, I have brownish blond hair and hazel eyes.
I am heavier build, with a larger bust, and broad in the hips, and medium height.
That is not the only difference, I am not as good a student, I like listening to classical music and love drawing and painting.


Â I cannot remember when it really started, but I have always been fascinated, with the looks of eyes
At a young age, I noticed eye colors, smiling eyes, angry eyes, and the look of eyes, behind the lenses,
of a person wearing glasses, those eyes I found always far more interesting to look at.
My dad is the only in our family who wears glasses, for reading, so I cannot tell you how, I got the fetish for eyes.


I have a real good friend, Joanne, who has been my friend since grade three.
Joanne, is a beautiful girl, with large brown eyes, and gorgeous dark blond long hair,.
She has grown, into a well developed woman. with a beautiful smile, and a great personality.
About a year ago, Joanne, started to wear glasses for myopia, and I think, wearing glasses, has made her look even more beautiful.
Every time I look at her, and see her eyes, behind the lenses, I am becoming more fascinated with the looks of eyes behind the lenses of glasses.
I love painting and drawing eyes, because I can make the eyes look soft, harsh, or whatever I want.
Lately I have been drawing, and even painting people wearing glasses
Since Joanne, started to wear glasses, I have drawn, and painted her wearing glasses.
I now prefer to paint and draw eyes, behind the lenses of glasses.
My mother looks at my art work sometimes, and she wonders why, I waste my time and talent on eyes, and people who wear glasses.


Joanne, to day showed me her new glasses, after her last eye exam, her prescription has increased.
The lenses were noticeably stronger, her eyes were looking a bit smaller, and I noticed, what looked like a ring, near the edge of the lens.
She let me try her glasses, and when looking at myself, in a mirror, loved the looks of my eyes behind the stronger lenses, and also noticed, I really like the way I look wearing glasses.
Joanne, told me how nice I looked wearing glasses, and I agreed that I liked that look.
Then, I asked her if I could try her old pair.
She handed me the glasses, and I put them on, and back to the mirror to look at myself.
I love how I look wearing glasses, and now I am sure, I want to to be a glasses wearing girl.
Looking around, wearing the glasses, I could see reasonably well, and found that the glasses were so comfortable to wear, and I did not wan to take them off.
Joann, knowing my fetish for eyes, told me to keep the glasses, you like eyes and glasses, just as much as I do, have fun.


That night, I made a drawing of myself wearing the glasses, I did it by putting a mirror, just at a spot, where I could see my glasses wearing face, every time I looked up.
When finished, I could not believe, how good the drawing was, it certainly looked like me, and how nice I looked wearing glasses.
I Liked it so much, that I did not want to hide it, and left it on display, on top of my drawing board.


When, I came home from school the next day, my mother, showed me my drawing, and wanted to know, who the girl wearing the glasses was.
Who do you think, she might be?
Well, she looks so much like you, who is she.? 
It is an excellent drawing, that is why I asked.
You are right, it is me, Joanne loaned me her old glasses, so I could look at myself, wearing the glasses, while making the drawing.
I love that drawing, and it was so much fun to do it.


That night, my mother showed the drawing to the rest of the family, and said look at your sisters new look.
Charlene said, Ashley, how can you do that to yourself, wearing glasses, when you don't need to wear them, you ruin your beauty, wearing glasses.
Megan thought, I looked quite nice, and asked me when, did I start to wear glasses.
My dad smiled, my dear Ashley, with her fetish for eyes, sure looks cute wearing glasses.
Well, so far so good, I now have an idea, what the opinion of the family is, about me wearing glasses.
I now have a great idea, and I am sure, that I will be wearing glasses pretty soon.


I am wearing Joanne's glasses every chance I get, and find that my vision wearing the glasses, is now perfect.
I like wearing the glasses so much, and see so well, that I hate, and sometimes forget to take the glasses off, and when I do take them off, everything far away, now is looking fuzzy.
I think, I am ready, for my great idea, to start wearing glasses all the time.


There is a driving course offered free of charge, after school hours, but you have to have a beginners license, to take the course.
So, I went to the office to apply for my license, because I knew, I had to take the vision test.
I had worn, Joanne's old glasses as often as I could, and took the glasses off, just before I went into the license bureau, where a very pleasant, glasses wearing lady, looked after me.
After all the paper work was complete, she told me I had to take the vision test. 
When I did the test, no surprise, I had trouble, reading the letters, and I failed the test..
The lady, told me I had failed the test, and gave me a note, saying, I failed vision test, and the date, and to come back when wearing glasses, with the note, and I would receive, my beginners license.
I was all smiles, when I walked out of the office.


When, I came home, my mother asked me why I was so late?
I told her about me going to get my beginners license, so I could take the driving course at school, and then handed her the note, saying that I failed the test, and to come back, when I was wearing glasses.
Mother, was very upset, her daughter having to wear glasses.
That night at mealtime, when she told my dad, he said, I am not really surprised, and I know she will look very nice wearing glasses, we better get her an appointment, for an eye exam.
I can't wait, for my appointment, next week.
Off course, I wore Joanne's glasses all I could, to make sure my eyes were ready for my eye exam, and my new glasses.


Joanne, told me about what to expect during an eye exam, and when I asked her to try her new glasses again, she handed them to me.
What joy, when I wore Joanne's new glasses, I could now see reasonably well when looking around,.
When I mentioned it, Joanne said, that is good news, I think, you are myopic now.


The day, of my eye exam, my mother handed me the vision insurance information, and said you are old enough to go by yourself, that sure, was not what I had expected to hear, but loved the idea.
Joanne, had suggested, if possible to wear the glasses as if they were my own, so that the optometrist had a starting point for my prescription, so I wore the glasses when going for my eye exam.
I enjoyed the eye exam, and was so happy, when the optometrist told me, he had to increase the prescription, I was wearing now, by 1/2 diopter, on each eye, and a slight change in my astigmatism correction.
That was better news, than I had suspected.
The optician, assisted me selecting a frame that looked fantastic, and now I can't wait for my glasses to be ready.


When, I went to pick up my new glasses, I was so excited, my own glasses.
When the optician, was finished adjusting the glasses, I had, at last a chance to look at myself.
I sure liked, my glasses wearing look, I think I look fantastic wearing glasses.
What pleased me most, that the lenses, showed that they were real prescription glasses
Then, I had a good look around, and could not believe the improvement, in my vision.
When, I got home, my mother told me, how nice I looked wearing glasses.
Charlene thought I looked all right, she sure does not like glasses.
Megan, was very impressed, and told me how nice I looked.
My dad of course was very complimentary, I could pull a bag over my head, and he tell me I look nice,
but, told me he sure likes the looks of my new glasses.


Later that night, Megan, came to my room, and asked me if she could try my glasses, she likes the looks of glasses, and would like to know. what she would look like wearing glasses.
After she put the glasses on and looked into the mirror, told me she likes her glasses wearing look, but the glasses were to strong. she could not see very well.
So I gave her Joanne's old glasses, and when she tried the glasses, told me how well she could see wearing them, and likes the way she looks, and than told me, she really would like having to wear glasses, she loves the looks and feel of them
Ashley, can I borrow these glasses? 
Yes, you can, but don't let your mother, or Charlene know.


When I saw Joanne the next day, she told me how she loves my glasses, and after trying them, said, I think we can switch frames if you want to, our prescriptions are just about the same.
I told her, that I had loaned her old glasses to Megan, and why, she did not mind, and said another glasses lover? Yes, I think so.
Now, all I have to do, is to make another coupler of drawings, of Megan, and of me, wearing our new glasses.


About a month later, Megan came to me, and told me she had been wearing the glasses at school all the time, and when she is not wearing the glasses, has trouble reading what is written on the blackboard. 
What shall I do?
I suggested she go, not wearing her glasses, to see the school nurse, and tell her, that you have trouble reading the blackboard.
The nurse most likely gives you a vision check, and then will give you a note, that you should have an eye exam.
So, Megan, came home and handed her mother the note from the nurse, which had to be signed, and returned to her.
All, I heard my mother say, Oh, No, not you to, what is going on, I can't believe you to need to wear glasses.
Well, my dad said, if she needs an eye exam, she better have on, and I suggest, Charlene should have an eye exam to, I have a feeling poor vision, might run in our family, and when they all wear glasses, then everybody can look at my beautiful glasses wearing family.
My mother made the appointments for eye exams, for my two sisters, Charlene was not happy, because she is afraid, that she might be told, you need to wear glasses.


After the eye exam, my mother told my dad the whole story, Megan needs to wear glasses, and needs a stronger than usual prescription, for wearing glasses for the first time.
Charlene, is a low myopic but has enough astigmatism, that she should be wearing her glasses all the time.
The glasses will be ready tomorrow afternoon.


The next day, when they all came home, Megan wore her glasses proudly, and dad said Megan, you look adorable, you look so nice wearing glasses, I love your new look.
Charlene, was mad and did not wear her glasses.
Dad, knowing how Charlene felt about having to wear glasses, said, Charlene, I like to see you wearing, your new glasses.
Hesitantly, Charlene put her glasses on, and dad said, now let me have a good look at you.
So Charlene moved closer to dad, my sweet girl, you look fantastic wearing glasses, I love your new look, you should be a proud glasses wearing girl.
Charlene, was going to take her glasses off, but dad said, no, you are supposed to wear your glasses all the time, and you better be wearing them, when I am around.
I know, you have been complaining about headaches, and wearing your glasses, I am sure will help alleviate your headaches, just like when you take pills to get rid of a headache.


So , both Megan, and Charlene., wore their glasses to school.
When I asked Charlene, if she had received any comments on wearing glasses?
Yes, I did, and none of them were nasty, I don't know, what it is about glasses, but a lot of the guys, who never paid any attention to me, gave me some very nice compliments.
I now realize, that having to wear glasses, is not all bad, and dad was right, I did not have a headache today.


After taking pictures of both Charlene and Megan, wearing their glasses, I am busy drawing my favorite pictures.
I love doing pictures of my sisters, I am so familiar with the looks of their faces,
because, I have drawn pictures of them before.
When the drawings were finished, they were fantastic, and everybody liked them.

I found out to day, I have to make another drawing now, this time, of my mother.
Evidently, she figured she should have an eye exam to, and she was prescribed glasses.
Today, she surprised everyone, when she was wearing her glasses.
She looks fantastic wearing glasses and told me, that now, she understands why I like the look of glasses.
She told me, she really likes her glasses, because she can see so much better, and loves the way she looks wearing glasses.
Charlene told me to day, that she now loves to wear glasses, she likes her new look, and all the attention, she gets from the guys, and no more headaches, all because she wears glasses.
Now she is like me, we cannot wait to get an increase in our prescription, to get lenses, that show some rings, and look like real prescription glasses 
I know, my dad likes the looks of glasses, and now, our whole family wear glasses, and they all love ,
wearing their glasses, and how they look, wearing glasses.
The glasses wearing fetish, I think, is very contagious.
