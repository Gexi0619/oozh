description: A chance encounter with a coworker named Amber reveals a surprising twist involving glasses and friendship.
---
This is just something that happened a couple of years ago.


A girl came to work with us called Amber and she was nice enough looking, she had blonde curly hair down to her shoulders and was a bit on the big side a bit and I noticed she had big thick glasses. So later on I went and chatted to her in the tearoom and I told her I liked her glasses and she smiled and said thanks. I asked if her vision was bad without and she said it was really bad without. I asked her next to try them on and she agreed giving them to me.

I tried them on and everything was blurry with them on. We had a laugh about it. I asked her what she could see and she said everything was really blurry. I asked if squinting her eyes help, she tried it but she said not really.

I backed a couple of steps back and asked if she could walk to me. She walked very slowly towards me and managed not to bump into anything. I gave her her specs back and we chatted about other things. We get on well and become good work friends.

I haven't seen her for ages because we work at different times.

She does wear contact lenses too and as worn them a lot but sometimes wears her specs too.
