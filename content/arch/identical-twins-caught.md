This story is fantasy but I wonder if something like this happened. I am not a twin and in fact am an only child.
Identical twins Joseph and Robert were born in 1961 to loving parents in Seymour Indiana to who were determined each twin would have their own indentiy. The parents when the twins were little flat refused to dress them alike and when older encouraged them to have different hair styles. Long hair on males was very in by the time they were teenagers and both wore their hair long in an almost indentcal styles. 
Rob as he was called was the first to need glasses at age 9 and Joe followed a year later.
At first the twins had different style glasses but the prescriptions were so close they sometimes switched to fool friends and family member in some harmless pranks. Later the twins to the chagrin of their parents decided to get the indentical glasses frames to pull some more pranks. The pranks all went well until their junior year of high school.
During second period the first semester of their junior year Rob had a U. S. history class and Joe had a typing class. Rob hated history and Joe already had taken the typing elective the year before. Joe was very good at history so you may have guessed what happened next. Joe and Rob switched classes during the first week of school that year. All went well with Joe getting good grades as Rob in the history class and Rob learning to type until the last week of the semester.
On Saturday before the last week of the semester Joe while playing in a pickup basketball game bent his glasses so bad he had to bring out his spare pair from last year. Joe and Rob were Myopic in the -3 range so either one going without glasses in school was not an option.   This was in the afternoon while had it been in the morning the scheme might have worked. The optical store closed at noon on Saturdys. The U. S. history teacher had noticed the different glasses during the class but didn't say anything. During the U. S. hitory teachers free period he stopped by and english class his cousin taught. Rob was in the class so the history teacher asked which twin that was and when he was told Rob the twins were caught.
Joe and Rob were taken to the office and their parents were called. The school considered expelling the twins but decided instead on a still severe punishment. Both tthe typing and U. S. history class were given a failing grade. The typing class didn't really matter since it was an elective but Rob would have to make up the U. S. history class in summer school  The hard to understand while hating history Rob was a good student in any class. The school also handed out 5 day suspensions to both twins. That meant both twins who had not missed a day of high school would not have perfect attendace.  Rob and Joe both missed some in grade school for things like chicken pox and mumps for which there were no vaccines back then.
The twins parents possibly came down harder then the school. Both Joe and Rob had completed drivers education that first semester and were ready to take the test for their drivers licenses. Joe and Rob were told you will now wait until the end of the school year for your licenses.
Joe and Rob took the punishments from their parents and the school. The twins graduated near the top of their class and may have been at the top if not for the sophomore stunt. The ironic think is Rob after going to college wound up a social studies teacher including U. S. history. Joe also went to college and to this day works for a major insurance company in Louisville Kentucky while living in Clarksville Indiana. Rob now retired from teaching is working for a major tax preparer during that season.
