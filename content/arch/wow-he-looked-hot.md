description: "Carolyn discovers the allure of glasses, leading to a surprising twist when her boss seeks her advice."
---
Carolyn had graduated from business college, and worked in the office of a small manufacturing plant. She liked her work and the people she worked with.
Some time later a new office manager was appointed . He was a pleasant , good looking man , she guessed about 30 years old.
She was wishing he wore glasses, that would make him a perfect male specimen.
Men wearing glasses turned her on.

At lunch one day with the girls, the subject of glasses came up, and Carolyn told the other girls how men wearing glasses turned her on. Jenny told her she felt the same way. Kathy was telling them that she wore contacts, she did not like glasses and certainly not on men.

One rainy night driving home from work, Carolyn noticed more halos than usual around car and streetlights, it bothered her as it was hard enough to see, everything in the distance seemed very fuzzy.
The next day at lunch she mentioned it to the other girls . Kathy asked her if she ever had her eyes examined, if she had not, she should have one.The symptoms of the halos and fuzziness sounded familiar to her.
Carolyn told them she had never had any vision problems and never had an eye exam. Kathy   suggested she look into it.

That night driving home from work, Carolyn noticed that everything looked the same as before, not very clear and lots of halos.
She thought about Kathy s suggestion to get her eyes examined. She had never thought about glasses for herself, but loved seeing men wearing them. She was not sure if she wanted to wear glasses , it might spoil her looks. She was going to look into it.

After supper she drove to the mall and went to the optical store.She told the optician that she would like to try some glasses ,
because she wanted to find out what she would look like wearing them.  She did not realize there were so many different frames available, and started trying some.  The optician mentioned to Carolyn, that with her skin tone and hair color, a dark half frame might look best.  So Carolyn tried some of the frames the optician suggested and could not believe her eyes.
She looked fantastic wearing that type of frame., so she decided to make an appointment for an eye exam for  Saturday morning. 
Wearing glasses might not be so bad , if she could look that good.
She was kind of looking forward to the eye exam, she had a feeling she might need to wear glasses.

Saturday morning she was kind of nervous, wondering what would happen.
At the optical  store the optician gave her some papers to fill out, and then went into the examination room. 
The optometrist was very helpful explaining the procedure, and when finished told Carolyn that  she was myopic and prescribed -1.25 lenses for each eye, and told her she had some astigmatism which had caused her to see the halos, and told her she should have good vision wearing glasses.
It did not take long to  select a frame, and after measurements and the money part was finished , she was told her glasses would be ready in a couple of hours.

She could hardly wait, and after some lunch and shopping went to pick up her new glasses.
After the glasses were fitted and she looked around could not believe the improvement in her vision, and when looking in the mirror at herself loved her new look, she was very happy.

On Monday at work all the girls complimented her on her new look. Even her boss noticed noticed her glasses and told her she looked fantastic, he was stunned that her boss had noticed her.

A few weeks later , Carolyn s boss called her into his office. She went took a note pad , knocked on his door and went in.
Carolyn you look beautiful wearing glasses, you have very good taste, and I was wondering if you could help me. 
I am new in this town, and not familiar with what is available, could you tell me the place where you got your glasses.
I think I should have an eye examination, can you recommend a good place.
At the Optical store where I had my eye exam, they were very professional ,friendly, and had a great selection of frames.
Her boss said that sounds good to me , would you be so kind to make an appointment  for Saturday  for me. Carolyn told him she would look after it.
When Carolyn walked back to her desk, all she could think of was how hot her boss would look wearing glasses, and made a phone call to make the appointment.

Friday afternoon went to the office of her boss to tall him that the optical store had called, to remind him of his Saturday morning appointment.  He thanked Carolyn for reminding him  and asked if she would mind going with him to select the right type of frame.
He told her he was clueless about glasses, and had no idea what would look good.
Carolyn was thrilled with the idea and told him she be glad to help, and would meet him at the optical store.

Carolyn was at the Optical store when her boss came in dressed in sporty clothes and looking very handsome. Wile he had the examination, Carolyn picked a number of frames that she thought would look good on him.
After the exam, he came to Carolyn and told her he needed to wear glasses, did she find any nice frames that might look good on him. Carolyn showed him what she had selected , and he started trying them on. Never in her life had she been so sexual aroused. She excused herself and ran to the bathroom.
After a while they decided what would look best , ordered the glasses and were told to come back after lunch and the glasses would be ready.

He invited Carolyn to have lunch with him, and they went to an Italian restaurant and enjoyed their meal.
Her boss asked her to call him George, told her he enjoyed her company , and also told her he liked the looks of  women wearing glasses. He was not sure about having to wear glasses himself. Carolyn assured him he would look great , and even more handsome.
and she told him it was easy to get used to wearing glasses, as they were comfortable and with the improvement in your vision well wort it.
When they went back to the store the glasses were ready, and George put them on. He looked stunning, Carolyn loved his new look an got all aroused again. She told him you could not look any better.
George was pleased with his looks and the reaction he got from Carolyn
He suggested they go and see a movie , to see how good the glasses were., and she thought that was a great idea.
The movie was pretty good, they tried each others glasses , and it did not take long and they were holding hands and a few kisses.
made more arousing when the glasses touched, they had a wonderful time.
After the movie George offered Carolyn to drive her home, which she gladly accepted.
When they arrived at her apartment, Carolyn invited George in for a drink. Oh yes he would like to, the movie had made him thirsty.
Not wanting George to leave, invited him to stay for supper, she would make a tuna casserole, he liked that.
After eating and drinking a bottle of wine, George was feeling no pain.
Carolyn told him it was not safe for him to drive home, he could stay at her place.
Since the sofa was not very big , George slept in Carolyn s bed ,exactly where she wanted him.
Her good looking man who wore glasses. HER DREAM FULFILLED.
