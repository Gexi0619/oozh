description: A family-owned business hides a secret, two siblings with poor vision, one embracing glasses, the other refusing.

This is based on a true story about 2 kids a boy 14 and a girl 9. Names and some details have been changed out of respect for the family. A business I frequent.in Fort Wayne Indiana is owned by a couple with a Son, Emil 14 almost 15 and a Daughter Stephanie 9. A while back when I visited I noticed Stephanie wearing what looked like strong plus glasses. After seeing Stephanie a couple of more times not wearing glasses I privately told her Mother that I was surprised she didn't have to wear glasses full time. The Mother told me yes Stephanie was supposed to wear glasses full time but didn't want to. About the time school started in August of last year when I visited Stephanie was now wearing glasses all the time at the business. I asked one time if Emil was supposed to wear glasses and was told yes he was Myopic or near-sighted but didn't wear them. Fast forward to last Tuesday night when I visited and I noticed Emil looking at his phone with his head and eyes very close to it. I asked Emil if your vision is that bad and he said no. Later that same night I noticed Emil looking at one of the smaller computer monitors and having to lean in to see it. I stood back from Emil and taking my glasses off (-1 R -2 L) and I could see the monitor. I wonder what is going to happen to Emil in a little over a year when he goes for his learners permit? Stephanie now apparently wearing her glasses full time and Emil not wearing his at all.
