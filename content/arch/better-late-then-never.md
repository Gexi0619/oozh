Better late then never.


Jimmy, who brought home, his mid term report card, now had to explain to his parents, why it is not very good.
Well, this year, they use books and anything, I have to read, with new letters that look all wiggely, and are difficult to read.
Well, I heard that Susan, next door, has a very good report card, why?
Susan, is smart, because she wears glasses, and she is the smartest girl in our class.
Jimmy, do you have a vision problem?
No, I can see just fine.
Jimmy’s parents did not know what to say next.


A few days later, Jimmy’s mother was talking to Susan’s mother,, and told her about Jimmy’s poor report card.
Linda, it sounds to me, Jimmy, might have a vision problem.
No, I don’t think so, he says he can see just fine.
Well they all say that, because they don’t know any better.


I discussed, about what Linda had told me, that night with, my husband, .
No wonder she would say that, her whole family wears glasses.
Jimmy had no problem playing ball, last summer, he can see just fine.


At the teacher, meet the parents night, Jimmy’s teacher, who is a high myopic, suggested to Jimmy’s parents, that Jimmy, might have a vision problem, and should have an eye exam.
Jimmy’s father, commented, that every person, who wears glasses, seems to think, they know, what to do.


Jimmy, was due for some vaccination shots, and while in the doctors office,
the doctor examined him, and a quick check up of his vision, and after the exam, told Jimmy’s mother, that she should consider, for Jimmy to have an eye exam.


Because, every person she has talked to, suggest for Jimmy to have an eye exam.
Jimmy’s mother, decided to get Jimmy’s eyes examined, but was not going to tell her husband, and also made an appointment, for Jimmy’s sister Amy, who is in grade 4 ,she wants to make sure, her children’s vision is looked after.


Because, Jimmy’s mother never had an eye exam, she had no idea what to expect, went to see her neighbour who wore glasses, and asked her, how 
an eye doctor examines an eye.
Her neighbour explained, the procedure, and now she had at least some idea of what to expect.
What is her husband going to say, if one of them, needs to wear glasses ?


When, we walked into the optical store, my daughter Annie, ran over to a glasses frames display, and tried them on, mom how do I look.
I was very upset, but the lady, said it was alright.
She asked for our name, and handed me a clipboard to fill out some information.
I sat in while Jimmy had his exam, and followed all the procedures, 
and felt guilty, that I had waited this long, to get our children’s eyes examined. 
The doctor told me, that Jimmy’s problem was some astigmatism, in both,
eyes, which distorted his vision, and has to wear his glasses al the time.
I guess all those people, who had told us, that Jimmy might have a vision were sure, smarter than, we were.
Jimmy, was not to happy. having to wear glasses, and while Annie had her eye exam, the optician, showed Jimmy, some frames for him to try on, to see what he looked like wearing glasses.
At last he found a frame he really liked, so the optician, took the measurements, while they waited, for, Annie and his mother,..
Annie, came out of the examination room, all smiles, she has to wear glasses


About, two hours later, I am going home, with both our children wearing glasses, what is my husband going to say ?
He did not even know I had made an appointment, to have their eyes examined.


While waiting, for my husband to come home, Jimmy did some reading wearing his new glasses, and told me, how well he could read now, all the letters were straight,
While Annie kept telling m, how she could see everything now, so nice and clear. 
The children’s comments made me feel, so much better,


When my husband came home. I expected a lot of noise, but all I heard
was Annie saying, how do you like my new glasses daddy, they are fantastic, I can see so much better now.
Annie you look like a beautiful young lady to me, I sure, like your new look
Where did you get the glasses?
Mommy bought them for me
Than Jimmie showed up, wearing his new glasses, dad I can read now, all the letters look nice and clear.
I am glad to hear that, I am sure, your next report card will be much better.


My husbands reaction, had surprised me, and after the children had gone 
to bed, I explained to him why I had taken Jimmy and Annie for an eye exam.
Well perhaps, we waited to long, to have their eyes examined, but like the saying goes better late then never
