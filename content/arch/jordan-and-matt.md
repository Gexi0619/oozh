description: Jordan's identity crisis escalates when he loses his last contact lens, forcing him to embrace a new look with glasses.
---
About 18 months ago, I wrote the story Jordan's 30th. Over the last couple of weeks have wanted to write something and so decided to look at my past stories. I realized that Jordan's 30th just scratched the surface of what i could do with the character. So I present to you both the original story for those who missed it the 1st time, and Part 2. Further parts will be coming just when is to be determined:) Also decided since I was writing about Jordan, only fitting if I wore my bifocals when writing it (a smidge different view in the bottom for me too:) )

He looked down into the sink and squinted at the sight. His last right contact lens, now torn and sitting along the edge of the basin. A tear began to form along Jordan’s face as he looked longingly at the torn lens.

For you see, a torn lens was more than a minor inconvenience for Jordan, he believed it to be the end of who he was. Jordan always has prized his looks above all else and thought that looks were all that mattered in life.

Jordan has worn contacts for most of his life, the contacts hiding the myopia that has plagued him or so he thinks since the age of 8. To be seen without his contacts is something that just has not happened for many, many years.

However, Jordan was about out of contacts and so went for a check up just past his 30th birthday to get fresh lenses. This exam did not prove to be the boring visit that he expected. It was such a disaster that Jordan really cannot remember most of it except for the bomb that Jordan’s eyes need a rest and so the doctor absolutely would not prescribe contacts at this time.

The rest of that experience is a blur as Jordan’s mind stopped after the contact issue. He did remember getting new glasses, but he only wore them just long enough to get home and put in his contacts.

The last month, Jordan has been carefully planning the wear of his contacts so they will last as long as possible. He refused to concede that he should stop wearing them until this moment. Now what is he to do?

Jordan tried to walk around with one contact lens in his eye. It was okay as long as he was at home as he just kept the other eye shut, but he needed some groceries and there was no way he could drive with just one contact.

Jordan looked at his view in the mirror; he really took great care to make himself attractive and looked at the cute, muscular appearance and decided that it might be worth a look to see what glasses would do to his image.

He knew himself enough to know that there was only one thing to do. He removed the contact lens and threw it away. He then decided to jump into the shower. A long soak got his mind free and clear for what was to come. He realized that he did not even remember what the glasses were like.

Removing himself from the shower, Jordan got ready to go out. It was a warm, spring day so he put on a grey tee shirt, his favorite jeans, and his Sperrys. After slipping on his shoes, he reached into the top drawer and removed the glasses case.

He stepped into the bathroom, coiffed his black hair, had everything ready, and then paused at the case. This was it, the moment where he becomes a new Jordan. He slowly opened the case and removed the glasses. He looked at them, the black plastic shined in the light and the lenses showed the strength that he tried to hide for so many years. He then looked and saw the strangest thing.

There seemed to be a line across the lenses of the glasses. Jordan looked at it and was confused by what that line was doing on his glasses. He opened the frames up and gently placed the glasses on his face. He looked upwards and was not horrified at the appearance. The black frames worked with his black hair, but what was more confusing to Jordan was how this line changed what he saw.

He looked down at the bottle of shampoo on the counter. Through the top part of the lens, the writing seemed okay to read and doable, and then a glance downward and it seemed different. It seemed a bit clearer and easier to read. This puzzled Jordan. Jordan continued to look around and experiment with everything he saw, especially now that he had two things to look through.

He looked over and noticed 2 pieces of paper in the glasses case. The first one he pulled out was his prescription.

Name- Jordan Parker
OD -8.25 -1.50 070 Add +1.50
OS -8.50 -1.75 130 Add +1.50

For Jordan, the numbers were just like a foreign language. He had no idea what they meant, except that his eyes were bad. He could tell that by the thickness of his new specs. However, as Jordan kept looking at the mirror, he was starting to embrace this new look. If he had to wear them, he might as well like them.

Curiosity made Jordan go back and look at the other piece of paper in the case. It was hand-written and hard for Jordan to read through the top, so he tried the bottom. It was a phone number and a bit about wanting Jordan to call after he had gotten smart about his glasses.

Jordan thought hard about the experience at the optical and started to wonder about how he had acted. He knew how frustrated he was at the time and wondered if he had been a jerk. The guy’s name on the paper was Matt and Jordan could not come up with any mental image of Matt in his mind.

It was driving J nuts and so he knew there was only one thing to do. He got in the car and drove to the optical. He was amazed during the drive at how clear everything was through his new glasses and everything was so sharp. He walked in the door of the shop and saw a really cute guy with his back turned. Jordan took a deep breath and wondered if this guy with the cute butt was indeed Matt.

Jordan was just standing when Matt turned around. Jordan could not believe his luck; Matt was tall and muscular just like Jordan with gorgeous blue eyes and blonde hair. His eyes set off by a pair of tortoise-shell ray bans. Matt smiled at Jordan and remarked that he must have finally seen the light.

Jordan chuckled and laughed in a nervous girlish voice. He quickly realized that he was major league crushing on Matt. Matt bent his head slightly and Jordan noticed a same line on Matt’s lenses. This is something that would need to be explored.

Jordan coughed and asked Matt about the bifocals. Being the dedicated professional Matt went over with Jordan everything that Jordan needed to know, why he got them, and why Matt was wearing them. Matt was a really great teacher and Jordan just kept looking at Matt with goo-goo eyes throughout.

When the lessons and cleaning of Jordan’s glasses was done, Jordan looked at Matt and asked if they could grab a bite to eat. As it was lunchtime, Matt obliged and off they went. Matt made sure they had a place with a menu to read so he could make sure Jordan was a good student about his new glasses.

Like clockwork, Jordan read the menu and was amazed at how clear the small type was through his bifocals. In addition, he noticed Matt sneaking a peek at J. So Jordan, happened to have a leg cramp and rubbed his leg against Matt’s. Being gentlemen, they really tried to keep themselves together until the meal was over.
They made it out to the parking lot and Jordan leaned over and kissed Matt on the lips. It would have lasted a lot longer except for Matt having to go back to work. Needless to say, Jordan and Matt would do more eyeballing later that night and for who knows how much longerJ
