 “You having a beer?”  Rob asked.
 
“If you are buying I’ll have a Heinnie.” I replied.
 
Rob got the two beers and brought them to the table off in the corner that I had chosen. Rob was my brother in law and my very best friend. We had gone to grade school together and then had been together all through high school. He had served in the military, but was recently discharged and had returned to the small town where we grew up to take over his father’s farm. His dad had been buying up acreage as it came on the market, and they were now farming over 500 acres, which was still a pretty small farm when you consider that some of the farms in the area that were owned by the big agribusiness conglomerates were now running to 3 and 4 thousand acres.
 
“How’s Mallory and Kenzie?” Rob asked.
 
“That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Mallory recently took Kenzie in to see her optometrist friend Lisa and now Kenzie is wearing glasses. They look to be pretty strong for a young girl’s first pair.” I told him.
 
“That’s not surprising considering how strong Mallory’s glasses are. It is likely genetic.  But I wouldn’t worry too much. Mallory does just fine, and after all she hooked you even though she wears what most people would consider coke bottle glasses.” Rob said.
 
“You know I have always had a bit of a thing for girls who wear glasses. And when I met Mallory again when she was in first year at university I took one look at her and realized that on a scale of 1 to 10, without glasses she would be a definite 10. But in my books, a girl wearing glasses comes in higher on the scale, so she became a 12 to me. I couldn’t understand why such a fox wore glasses instead of contacts but I didn’t care so I asked her out. I had to be really careful that my fetish for girls that wear glasses didn’t come out because if it had she might have realized that I had really picked her because of her glasses. And there were likely lots of other girls around campus that would have attracted me, but they were all wearing contacts.  I wanted a girl who wore glasses, but there are lots of other guys out there that would be attracted to a girl and then later on when they saw her in glasses they might be turned off.” I said.
 
“I know what you mean. I was pretty shocked when I came back from my stint in the military to see at how thick her glasses had gotten. I knew she could always wear contact lenses and she would be a real beauty. But I also knew you had a thing for girls with glasses so I figured she was just the ticket for you.” Rob replied.
 
“She was. Sometimes I think it would have been nice if I had found a lady that didn’t have such really poor eyesight.  Mallory scares me sometimes. She does have contact lenses, but the only time she ever wears them is when she goes to the MVD to have her driver’s license renewed. I don’t know if she could meet the minimum requirements with her glasses. But then when she gets her new license it is just restricted to corrective lenses. I have asked her if her vision is good enough for her to be driving with glasses and she always tells me that it is a bit better than the 20/40 minimum but she doesn’t want to take the chance that she is having a bad day so she wears her contacts just to be sure she can get her renewal.” I replied.
 
“Can’t she get nicer looking glasses in her prescription?” Rob questioned.
 
“She could if she wanted to. Her old glasses looked nicer to me, and I like it when she has them on. She wears them to bed every night with a strap around her head so they will stay on her face. I don’t know why she won’t take them off to sleep, because she certainly doesn’t need them then, but she tells me that she has a panic attack if she doesn’t have them on when she wakes up in the middle of the night and has to go to the washroom. Your mom told me that she knocked her glasses off the bedside table one time when she was younger and was really freaking out until she found them and ever since she has worn glasses to sleep in. In the morning she wears those glasses until she sits down to do her makeup, and then she puts on a special pair of glasses that have flip down lenses. Once her makeup is finished she puts her normal glasses on. I don’t know why she won’t buy a pair of glasses with those special lenses that have a little circle in them. Her old glasses were made that way, but she wanted what the optician called full field lenses. They are dished in so deep on the front that they look a little weird to me. It seems as if she wants people to stare at her and wonder just what she can see with those thick lensed glasses.” I answered.
 
“You have always admitted to me that you have a fetish for girls who wear glasses. Is she not just perfect for you?” Rob asked.
 
“She is. She really is. It’s just she is starting to worry me. I have been talking to your mom about Mallory’s poor eyesight. She never wore glasses until she was in grade 1 at 6 years of age. Her teacher, who was a very nearsighted lady herself, apparently noticed that Mallory wasn’t seeing very well and took her to see her friend, who is the same lady optometrist that she still goes to. Mallory’s first prescription started out at -5D, a fairly strong prescription for a girl of 6. And then by the time she was in grade 2 your mom had taken her back for a checkup and her glasses ended up being -7.50D. Now Kenzie has had her eyes tested at age 3 and she is wearing -5D glasses. It really worries me that Kenzie’s eyes are so bad at such a young age.” I replied.
 
“Are you thinking that maybe Mallory’s teacher and the optometrist were in cahoots? And that now possibly Mallory and the optometrist are working together to make Kenzie wear glasses as well” Rob questioned.
 
“I don’t know what to think Rob. Your mother told me that when Mallory was little she seemed to have a fascination with eyeglasses. It is very possible that she actually needed glasses badly when she was in grade 1. But it is also very possible that her first grade teacher saw in her a little girl that was fascinated with glasses and took her to see her friend Louise who just happened to be an eye doctor. Mallory is very different from other girls who wear glasses in that she will not ever take her glasses off. She tells me that she has an anxiety attack if I take too long cleaning them for her, and maybe that is true, but it certainly is weird.  And then when we are making love she wears her old glasses strapped to her head. Your sister is a real tiger in bed. She wants me to play around with her a lot and sometimes I am so horny I have a hard time holding on. I know she comes when she has me suck her nipples and generally by the time I am inside her I blow my load very shortly. I love her so much, but she has me very concerned about Kenzie maybe having the same poor eyesight. And she is pregnant again so I am afraid what will happen if it is another girl.” I told Rob.
 
“Well buddy, I hope it is all in your head. Have you talked this over with my little sister?” Rob asked.
 
“I am afraid to. What if it is true that the teacher – who by the way is still teaching at the grade school – and the optometrist are working together to find little girls who want to wear glasses.  I read somewhere that the focusing power of a young child is really quite a lot, and they could easily wear glasses that are -5D when they are that young. And if they wore those glasses for a year, it would likely jump start their myopia so that they might end up with better than a -2.50D, maybe even -3.50D. Then it would be easy to have them wear another -4.00D stronger glasses.” I said.
 
“Wade, this is quite a conspiracy theory. Why don’t you just ask Mallory a few questions about her myopic progression? It is very probable that she just has progressive myopia and her first grade teacher noticed that she was squinting a lot in school so instead of telling our mom she just took her to see her friend. You might not know this but Ms. Gillespie actually paid for Mallory’s first glasses out of her own pocket and told my parents that if they didn’t have the money to pay her back it was all right. Also, if the mother is a progressive myope it is not unusual that one or more of their children are as well. Actually, with my sister being so very nearsighted I am a bit worried that one, or both of my girls might become very nearsighted as well, as it might run in the family.” Rob replied. 
 
There wasn’t much more we could talk about. I was kind of glad we had this little conversation, because Rob would likely have told me his thoughts if he had any idea that Mallory had created or caused most of her own myopia with the help of her teacher and a friendly optometrist. I asked Rob if he wanted another beer and he told me that one was his limit and he needed to get back to the farm. So we headed off in different directions.

I was feeling a little bit better after sounding off to Rob about my worries. He had sort of convinced me that Mallory was just a very nearsighted woman and that our daughter Kenzie was following in her footsteps.
 
It was fortunate for me that I did not see the text message that Rob left for his sister that followed our meeting.
 
“Hey Mall, I just left Wade at the bar. You had better watch yourself with Kenzie and her myopic progression. Wade is kind of suspicious about the possibility that you and Louise worked together to increase your prescription, and that maybe Kenzie is wearing glasses that she doesn’t really need. I think I have calmed him down and have convinced him that you were a progressive myope right from the time you were 5 or 6. But he hit the truth right on the head when he suggested that maybe Ms. Gillespie helped get you in to see Louise to have your eyes tested and to get your first glasses. I didn’t understand you then, and I still don’t understand you now, but what the heck, I am only your older brother.”
