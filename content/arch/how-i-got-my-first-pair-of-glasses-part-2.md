William gave a big smile.”Shall we have coffee in the garden dear”

“It's so nice sitting out here dear,can we come here often now we are together”

“Yes of course dear,do you mind if I smoke,I only have cigars but if you want some cigarettes we can order for you dear”

“It's Ok William if you like smoking cigars I don't mind. ,I have never smoked as I don't like the smell of cigarettes”

“That's a beautiful aromatic smell William, it's nothing like the smell of cigarettes”
“Can I come and sit next to you”
“I love inhaling the smoke up my nose dear,it's beautifully relaxing”

“I'm glad you don't mind me smoking dear”

“What does it taste like William”

William took a long drag on the cigar, then he removed it from his mouth and placed it against my lips, I loved the taste of it. He did this several times before placing it in between my lips and telling  me to keep it in my mouth and hold it there myself.

“Suck it a little Elizibeth then let the smoke drift out of your mouth,now take it out of your mouth and hold it yourself before putting it back in”

It felt so strange holding a cigar between my fingers,and placing it back between my lips 

I looked at William, he had just lit himself another Cigar,was he suggesting that 
 I smoke all of the cigar I had in my mouth now.
“Suck it a little harder Elizabeth,or it will go out”

I coughed a little to start with but I loved the taste as well as the smell 
I enjoyed the rest of the cigar 

I had just smoked MY first cigar.

After work can we go there to eat, then go into the garden and enjoy a glass of wine and a cigar.
I still find it difficult to light it, but I really enjoy smoking it .
I now smoke at least one cigar a day and on weekends 2 or 3 it's very relaxing, I tried a cigarette the other week but I hated it.

I'm sure I will get some strange looks.
This young lady with thick glasses enjoying smoking her cigar haha 


We are now planning our wedding. 

“William Can I have a new pair of glasses for our wedding dear”

“Yes of course dear,what would you like”

“I think I would like some stronger lens again please,I know you enjoyed seeing me getting used to stronger lens before so maybe you surprise me, but give me time to get used to wearing before the wedding haha 

“Ok dear but you will soon find it harder to adjust to me over prescribing the grade of lens you need”

“O why is that William I know you enjoyed me pretending I needed stronger lens haha”

“As a person gets older it's more difficult to adjust your eyes to stronger lens”

“I understand,so can you increase this pair more than you normally do,in case it the last time you can please William, Then I will get that same fetich feeling that you get.I love people looking at my glasses”

“Wow William I have never seen lens like these before”

“They are called Biconcave lens dear I have increased your prescriptions a lot this time dear 
R- 35.25 - 2.75 170 prism out 8
L -38.25 - 3.75 175 prism out 10.They are caved in at the  back and this time at the front and not flat like you have worn before

“But how will I see to read dear they are not bifocals.

“I have made you a second pair dear, they are Myodisc bifocals”

“They are very different William will I get used to looking through so small circles”

“Yes dear it will take some time you can decide which you like best if you like the Biconcave  best then I can make you a separate pair of reading glasses”


The wedding service was wonderful, I wore my Myodisc bifocals,but then changed for the reception into my Biconcave glasses and laid my reading glasses case on the table next to me.
I had written a Small speech,to thank our guests,I could see William looking at the case with my reading glasses in.

I had talked to the tectninion about frames and the sort of lens I wanted for my reading glasses and had kept them a secret from William.
I had that excited fetish feeling starting to rush through my body,I slowly took a cigar out of its case after lighting it and placing  it between my bright red lips. I could feel William getting excited.

I had chosen red plastic frames with C39 lenses made from oversize blanks that had not been thinned. The flat fronts of the lens  protruding forward of the frames by about half an inch, the backs of the lens had been scooped out in the middles but the sides of the lens were so thick that the touched my cheeks.i put my notes on the small stand in front of me,
I took a long drag on my cigar then holding it between my left finger I started to read my speech.
I could not resist putting my right hand under the table,and squeezing Williams protruding trousers suddenly I felt his fingers pushing  between my legs 



We have been married for nearly a year now 

“ I know we both have a fetich about glasses and eyesight William”
“Could you make me a pair of glasses with blacked out lens so I could pretend to be blind some days and maybe I carry a white cane”

“Are your sure dear”

“Yes I'm sure William can they make them very dark so it's difficult for me to see”


“I have a better idea dear if you are sure you want to look like a blind person and 
IU blind for a day”

“Yes please William, but not permanently blind”

“We can make you a pair of prosthetic eyes to wear that look like a blind person's eyes, then you be completely blind, and you can still wear glasses, because you look prettier in glasses”

You mean I would see nothing at all”
“I'm so excited”

3 weeks later William showed me the prosthetic eyes that they had made for me, they were wonderful, they had that blind vacant look.

William fitted the right prosthetic eye first.

“Would you like to look in the mirror Elizabeth,before you become completely blind”

“Wow William it looks so real,can you fit the other please”

It was a wonderful feeling as William fitted the other prosthetic eye and I entered MY blind world.
It took me a few weeks to get used to using a cane.
But now as soon as we get home on a Friday night William fits my prosthetic eyes and I spend the complete weekend as a blind person. Sadly on the Monday morning before we go to work I have to get William to take MY prosthetics out and return to the sighted world.

I have 4 pairs of prosthetic eyes in different colours and one special pair that looks as if I have had both eyes totally removed and waiting to get prosthetic eyes haha 

Also I know William love me wearing thick high grade lens so I suggested  he made me a special pair of glasses 
To wear over MY prosthetic eyes
R- 48.25 - 2.75 170 prism out 20
L -38.25 - 3.75 175 prism out  20 
They would be much too strong for me to be able to see with.but I love being blind and William says I look sexy wearing these enormously thick lenses and smoking my cigars..


William does not know I'm learning Braille, my plan is to wear MY prosthetics all the time soon.

THE END
