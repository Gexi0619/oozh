I know I've told this before but I started thinking I was Myopic by 6th grade and was sure by 8th grade. I did not get glasses until age 22 and didn't start wearing them until age 26. I missed a bunch. In school I liked to go to basketball games and even an occasional football game. As you may have guessed by some of my writings I'm a big stock car racing fan and went to one of our local track anytime I could get there before I started driving and after getting my license to 2 different tracks on Friday and Saturday. I missed seeing the games and the races clearly by not having glasses. What really got me about not seeing clearly was going to Salem and Winchester both legendary tracks in Indiana that were a 1/2 mile long the biggest tracks I had been to up to that point. I also was a pro wresting fan (insert joke here) and for years I went just about every Tuesday night to the Louisville Gardens just across the Ohio River from where I live. I went to my first NASCAR Winston Cup race in 81 at Nashville which at the time was the closest to me and the only one I could afford. Except for football which I only went to be with friends I went back to every one of the venues mentioned wearing glasses and could not believe the difference even though I was in my mid to late 20's by this time. I will mention how much glasses helped with driving especially at night. I got scared and got my glasses after some close calls driving at night including almost hitting a pedestrian which probably would have killed the man. After the last close calls I knew I had to get glasses. In closing if there are any teenagers reading this or if you are a parent of a teenager read or show them this post about what a now "old man" learned over 30 years ago.
