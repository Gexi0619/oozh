description: Discover the captivating journey of a young individual whose vision stabilized through an unconventional experiment with bifocals.

I got my first pair o glasses at age 7. In 2011 at age 14 my prescription was -6 and -7. I know there are stronger prescriptions but I couldn't see without my glasses. When I went to the Dr. he talked to my parents about slowing myopia progression. What the Dr. wanted to do was put me in lined bifocals. I'm in the US but a study in China showed promise in reducing myopia. My parents said they would not force me into this. The decision was mine. Tired of my eyes getting worse all the time I said go for it. I got the bifocals and was surprised I wasn't teased at school. The new glasses took some time getting used to but in time I did. I decided to have some fun because of wearing bifocals. I told my best friend when not around teachers to start calling me bifocal Billy as my legal name is Billy and not William. My friend got some grief from kids not in on the joke as we had about 10 kids in the joke. For the next 4 years while finishing high school my Myopia only increased by a total of -.25 while before the experiment it had been going up by an average of -1 every year. At age 16 the Dr. had me try progressive. As hard as I tried I could not get used to them so I went back to lined bifocals. In 2019 on my exam my eyes had become so stable the Dr. wanted to get away from the bifocals. The problem was I had gotten used to reading with the bifocals and had trouble reading without them. In 2018 while in my early 20's the Dr. again had me try progressive which again I couldn't get used to. My near correction had been +1.75 the whole time. In 2019 I went back to lined bifocals. I am one of the few 20 somethings happily wearing lined bifocals. Though later studies have showed the bifocal/progressive thing to slow myopia didn't work as well as first thought bur since age 14 to my early 20's my vision has only changed by -.50 in one eye and -.25 in the other one. I disagree with the later studies.
