Andrews story part 3 

Mary's phone bleeped,
“I think I have a phone message” Mary said.
“Can you read this for me please Jhon? I can't see any of the message now, even if I enlarge the text”.
It says yours our outdoor glasses have been delayed but your new reading glasses are ready,
Do You want to pick them up or wait till both pairs are ready?
Tears were running down her eyes,” I think I'm going blind Andrew  last week I  could just manage to read messages, but now I can't”
“Can we go now and collect them? I keep getting such bad headaches and even seeing in the distance is difficult now.and I keep seeing double”
Of course we can dear, you are very tired and stressed I expect that's why you can't see to read.
The assistant  explained that when the the doctor had discovered there would be such a long delay getting the glasses with bioptic lens for reading attached ,he had ordered a pair with C39 lens to help her to read,I could see the prescription paper on top it read R+38.50. 4.24 180 Prism out 18.
 L +27.50. 3.25.120 Prism out 14.
When she opened the box and got Marys new reading  glasses out,they were in a transparent plastic frame With a pink strap to help hold them on.
The lens looked like 2 paper weights,
The centres of the lens bulged out, the right lens was almost 2 ins.thick in the middle, what  made them look even worse was the difference in the thickness of the 2 lens.
I remembered there was over +10 difference, but I had not expected it would look so different.
Mary gasped” NO NO! I can't wear them Andrew I can't wear them I will look like a freak”.
“Don't let her put them on me please ,tears were rolling down her face”.
She Pulled both hearing aid buttons out of her ears and let the cords hang down.
“I'm blind now as well as deaf ,I want to go home”
Calm down dear,you only need to wear them at home dear.
“I don't want her to see me wearing them”.
I asked can we take them home so Mary can try them tonight. 
“Yes I'm Sure that will be ok,I will give you our spare reading test card just let us know which line Mary can read”.
“Make her put them back in the box please Andrew”.
As soon as we were out of the shop I gave Mary a big hug and carefully fitted her hearing aid buttons back in her ears ,

When we got home Mary went straight to bed even though it was only 2pm.
About 3 hours later I could hear her  sobbing heavily.
I quickly made a strong cup of coffee and went into the bedroom,I knew Mary would not hear me coming in as without her hearing aids in she was profoundly deaf, so I turned the light on and off so she knew I was there I then gave her a big hug.
I picked up her hearing aids and gently pushed the 2 pink buttons into her ears arranged the cords and tucked the boxes into the special pockets Mary had sewn into her bra. 
“O Andrew Im sure that I will go blind”.
You will be ok dear after the operation.
“But that's 2 or 3 years aways”.
The eye shop said that they have even stronger lens that would help you dear we just have to except that the glasses will help dear. And the doctor gave me a white cane for you dear.
Let's try these new glasses dear I'm sure they will help,
I don't mind what they look like as long as you can see to read darling.
I gently put them on for her and tighten the strap around her head,
I felt a strange feeling of excitement,they had fitted the lens in round 
Transparent plastic frames,so all I could see were 2 Hugh eyes one larger than the other.
I remembered as a child I had a goldfish in a round bowl,and if you looked at the side of the bowl it made the fish look Hugh .

“O my god I really can see to read my phone”

“What  do they look like Jhon? “I know I must look very ugly”.
They are fine dear they just make your eyes look very big.
“It's so much easier to see to read than looking through the small bioptic lens.in my old glasses”
You stay in bed dear I will bring breakfast in.
When I returned with breakfast Mary put her book down and smiled.
“My head aches have gone”she said 
That's good dear why don't you keep them on today,we have nothing planned.
Which is worse seeing things double and having headaches or wearing these new glasses dear?
“Well it is nice not having headache, but I can't see very far in them”
Mary knew were everything was in the house,so she wore them all morning,
While eating lunch Mary said “I have not had any headaches now ,and I'm  not seeing double,I only have one plate with food on the table haha”
“Can we go into the garden and take our coffee with us”
Ok do you want your old glasses back,
“If you hold my hand I think I rather keep these on” “that's if you not mind see me looking like this”
It's so nice out dear why don't we go to the lake and have coffee there instead,
“But I will look such a freak wearing these glasses”
You can't stay in the house all the time dear
“Ok but don't let go of my arm dear”
“It's strange it's easier not seeing things more that a few feet away then seeing double and having to try to focus on things.
You wait there dear I will get some money and we can walk there slowly,
When I returned I opened the cane  that the eye doctor had given us.
Mary looked a little surprised but did not object.
She just said “I suppose I had better get used to using it”.
It seemed strange to see Mary using a cane,but she held by arm very tight as well.
When we got to the coffee shop Mary sat down,and asked if Many people were staring at her
I told her I had not noticed anybody.
“You are not a very good liar Andrew”
“I hated the idea of being seen wearing these glasses,but I can see a little better now with them and the cane gives me confidence,I want to try walking home without holding you dear .
