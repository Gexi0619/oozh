I now have a glasses, fetish.


My mother, feels much better to day, her divorce is now finalized.
I will tell you what happened, my mother wears glasses, she is a very high myopic.
When she had her last eye exam, the Doctor told her, that she could not wear her contact lenses anymore.
At the same exam, she had another increase, in her prescription, and now wears glasses, that are called myodisc lenses, my dad told her, he could not stand the looks of her, wearing glasses that strong, and walked out on her.
We now know, it was an excuse, because he had a girlfriend, and moved in with her. 
At least, we still have the house, and my mother works. and makes enough money, to pay the mortgage, and for us to live, so I can finish high school.
I do the house work, after I come home from school, and make sure our evening meal is cooked, for when she gets home.
I always manage, to get my home work done, and have good marks.
My mother is a legal secretary, and works at a law firm, and has been there for a long time.


To night. when we were having our supper, mom, seemed quit, and in deep thought, and then said, Amber, I think you should know, that I have a boy friend, and, I would like you to meet him, and his daughter.
I, hope you don't mind, but I invited them over, for supper, Saturday night.
Mom, that is great news, you deserve some happiness, in your life, I will be glad to cook the meal, and make them feel at home.


Saturday, I was busy, and after a bath, and doing my hair, got dressed .
In case you wonder, I do not wear glasses, I have had, regular eye exams, and I am not myopic, like my mother.


When the door bell rang, my mother let our guests in, and introduced them to me.
The gentleman, told me to call him George.
He is a very pleasant, glasses wearing gentleman. 
His daughter Sandy, is a couple of years older then I am, a pretty girl, with a beautiful head of red hair,
After an enjoyable evening, we all now know, each other, a little better.


After our visitors left, my mother wanted to know,,how I liked her friend.
Mom, he looks like the type, that has a sense of responsibility, and does mind you wearing strong glasses.
George, told me, he loves the looks of my glasses, and also told me, he loves looking at my eyes, behind the strong lenses.
Well, that is good to hear, it will make you feel better having to wear your glasses, and that he likes the look of glasses, with myodisc lenses.
I think Sandy, is a very pleasant girl.


The next time, I met Sandy, she was wearing glasses, she looked fantastic wearing glasses, and I told her so.
With her red hair, and the black frames, on her glasses, I think, she looks better wearing glasses, than without glasses.
She told me, she is myopic, like her dad, and my mother., and she let me try her glasses, but wearing her glasses, did not improve my vision, but my mom, and George thought, I looked very nice wearing glasses.
Sorry guys,, I do not need glasses., I can see just fine.


Not long after, my mother married George, and I know have a father, and a sister.
Now, I understand, why George, likes my mother, he is a person who, just loves glasses, the stronger the better.
He admitted to me, that he has a glasses, fetish, that he loves the look of glasses.


To day, I caught George, wearing very strong, myopic glasses.
I asked him, what had happened to his eyes, that he now needed to wear glasses, that strong.
He told me, he was doing, glasses, over contacts, and explained to me, how it was done, and that he likes the feeling, it gives him, when he looks trough very strong lenses.
Does mom, know about this?
Yes, I have done it a few times, while we were dating, and she thinks it is funny, and told me, if it makes me happy, to go ahead and have fun..
George, now wears his strong myopic glasses, more often around the house,
I find it fascinating, and I wonder what it is like, to look through such strong lenses, and be able to see properly.


I talked to Sandy, about her dad, and his strong glasses, have you ever tried it?
No Amy, I have not, he likes it, but I think, he is nuts. 


For a while now,when reading , and watching T.V., I have been having more headaches.
When I talked to my mother, she suggested, I have an eye exam.
Mom, I can see just fine, I can see miles away, there is nothing wrong with my vision.
Well, then I suggest you go, and see our doctor, and he can examine you.


I went to the doctor, and after he examined me, told me there is nothing wrong with my health, and thinks, I might have a vision problem, and to go, and have an eye exam.


Well, was I surprised, when the eye doctor, told me, to be sure to wear my glasses all the time, because, my astigmatism, is the reason, I have head aches.
So, now I am wearing glasses, I chose a frame, that I think, almost makes me look better.
I had a hard time getting used to wearing my glasses, due to the astigmatism correction, but now my vision, is really good, and no head aches.


I now like wearing glasses, like the way I look, with my larger looking eyes, behind my + 3.00 lenses. 
Peter, loved, my new glasses wearing look, and that everybody now wears glasses
My mother, is a lot happier now, he is happy with her marriage, and her family.


George asked me, how I liked wearing glasses.
I really, like wearing glasses, I like my looks, no headaches, and can see everything nice and clear.
You know, I have a large collection of glasses, I think, you have +3 lenses, I will find you a pair of glasses, that when you wear them over your glasses, will give you some idea, what a myopic person sees.
I like to try that, so George handed me a pair of glasses, and asked me to put the
glasses on over top of my present ones.
When, I did, could not believe, how everything looked smaller, and farther away.
I think that is great, I never realized, that myopic lenses, made everything look smaller, and far away.
Amy, that is why, I like to wear glasses over contacts, it is a very exciting feeling.
Would you like to try it?
Yes, I like to try, glasses over contacts, it sounds very exciting.

George, soon figured out the. proper lens combination, and had me go to an optical store, for contact lens measurements.
A couple of weeks later, after we received, the contact lenses in the mail, Peter taught me, how to insert the lenses, and how to remove them. 


George, before he ordered the contact lenses, had me select a frame, from his large collection of eyeglasses, the glasses, that I would like to wear.
I liked a frame, with a -18.00 prescription, that I was going to wear, to do my G.O.C.. I liked the looks of the lenses, and the frame that they were in.


The contact lenses came, today, so now, we are all set


The big day came, and I inserted the contact lenses, and put on the glasses.
Good thing, that I was sitting down, when looking through the strong myopic lenses, I felt a dizzy feeling, and after it settled down, could not believe, my vision.
Everything, I looked at, looked smaller and farther away. but bright and clear.
George asked me to stand up, which I did, and he hung on to me, while I walked around the room.
I could not resist, stopping in front of a mirror, to look at myself.
Now, I noticed how small my eyes looked, and the thickness, of the lenses, as well, as the narrowing of my face, behind the glasses.
What an experience, I loved it.


That, was the start, of my G.O.C. experience, and now do it regularly.
I sure like my new dad, George he is a lot more fun, than my dad was..
I think, I now have a glasses fetish, I sure like glasses to wear, and to look at..
