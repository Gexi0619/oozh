description: High school musicians form a band and navigate their passion for music while facing challenges and rivalries.
---
**It has been a while since my last post, I'm leaving you with my most recent one. I hope you like it. WARNING IT HAS SEXUAL CONTENT**

"THE DIOPTERS"


Today is my first High School day  and I’m so nervous. On 8th grade my face filled with pimples, thank god now they’re gone. I love to sing and I play the guitar as well so I’m hoping to find some other musicians now and form a band. I’ve heard that in Walson Institute they take aptitudes very into consideration. I would love to live out of my passion: music.

The first class is over and it wasn’t something special, but now we’re heading to “art” class and I’m really excited about it. 
The classroom is humongous! We have a piano, acoustic guitars, an acoustic bass, acoustic drums, violins, mandolins, banjos, flutes, even an old organ type of piano that has tubes coming out of it. 

“Welcome everybody, please take a sit wherever you can,” said a blonde lady, she wasn’t so bad looking but she reminded me of a movie character from Mathilda, the super tough principal who made the chubby guy eat an entire cake….

“You see, this institute has a rule that I love. You don’t only have to be part of one of our clubs, you need to make a difference. Wether is on sports, the paint club, the drama club or this particular one. Whichever you choose is the one you are going to be focusing in, then you may apply for a sports scholarship, an art institute, or whatever you want to do.” 

Wow, my dad was right, I was so gonna love to be here. 

“Raise your hands and go to the football field the ones who are going to the physical activity matter,” Said Mrs. Natou while about half of the classroom stood up and left. 

“Ok, now for the musicians. Who’s in for the music club?” And I stood up really fast and I saw 3 guys and a girl standing up as well. “5 out of 26?!! That’s why good music is dying,” Said Mrs. Natou in a very sarcastic way. 

We where set apart from our classmates and Mrs. Natou came to us. 

“Ok, so it’s just the six of us. I hope you already have some experience because I wan’t to beat the other clubs again”

“Again Mrs?,” Said the only girl in the class

“Yes, again. We always beat the “s” out of the other clubs. We are the only club to have international famous people that end up doing what they love”

I wondered who that might be but since I was a bit intimidated by her I didn’t ask. 

“I wan’t you to learn everything about one another, I want you to feel as you knew each other from your whole life. And I want you to define if you’re going solo or as a band.”

This was more than I was hopping to find. Not only was I gonna be able to find people who loved music as much as I do, but it was my responsibility to make it happen. 




“My name is Oscar, but everyone calls me Oz. I play the guitar and I sing as well. I like old school rock, my favorite bands are Queen and The Beatles.” I said without hesitation

“Cool, I’m Charlie, I play the drums and a little bit of piano. I’m into jazz music,” replied one of the boys

“I am Liz, I play the guitar too and I think I can sing.” said the girl

“I hate new music, I wish I was alive when Hendrix was. I’m Kevin, I play the piano and the drums too,” said the coolest one of us, he had a really weird but cool style and wore thick glasses that looked like bubbles

“So, I guess we can form a band now. I’m Rick and I play the guitar, the bass and the drums. But two of you already play the guitar, and the other two play the drums, I can play the bass and we’re set… If you want of course” 

Rick had formed us as a band in only one sentence; it was decided and we had a lot of work to do, so we spent about one week knowing each other and what a week it was. I never knew you could call “friends” to a group of people you knew nothing about a week ago.

“So what kind of music are we playing?,” Said Charlie, our drummer 
“I think we should play rock, but something like new school-eom rock, like blink 182,” said Liz.
“That’s not rock liz, it’s called punk… The best way to go is to cover some songs first and then we’ll find our own style,” I replied
 
Everyone agreed, but now we had another question, what was gonna be our band name?

“I have the perfect Idea,” Said Kevin, “ever since I was 2 months old I had to wear thick glasses, they became a trademark for me and you know how people can be mean when wearing such thick lenses. I’m thinking we name the band “The Diopters” and we can use my biggest flaw as a trademark too, besides it sounds cool”

I don’t know If it was Kevin’s way of acting, or the fact that his glasses were so mesmerizing, but I said I loved the idea and everyone else agreed. 

It was a cold kinda rainy monday morning, we now had a name and I had a few ideas for our logo. 

“Hey guys, I think we can really take this opportunity. A lot of people wears glasses and they may identify with our band. If we can get to one of them, I think we can make it. I already have some logos in mind”

Liz said “Maybe this will sound crazy, but I asked Kevin to bring his old glasses so we can all try them on and take a picture for our facebook profile picture”

“Great idea!!” I said “It’s an amazing idea Liz, well thought”  
By this point it was pretty obvious I was gonna be the leader, not the kind of leader that separates a band… the kind of leader that helps everyone. 

Kevin indeed brought his glasses and he gave us one pair each and we wore them for about 1 minute and Rick took them off after the picture and said “You know what? I’m thinking this is not a good idea. No one will ever look up to us if we wear this coke bottles. No offense Kev, but these things make us look like Piggy, the dude from Lord of the Flies” 

I saw how Kev went from smiling to feeling very bad about himself in a second so I stood up and said “Man, you may not be onboard on everything we say, but you have to be a little less aggressive and you need to make sure you’re comments don’t hurt anybody here”

“Look Oz, this isn’t gonna work. You guys have to face things. Liz you’re not that good looking to be the face of our band, Oz you are good looking man but you are a little too feminine, I’m the one that should be the face of this project… Kev sorry dude, but your glasses need to go away” As he finished his sentence he took Kevs glasses off his face and he lost it!

“GIVE THEM TO ME RICK, I WON’T SAY THIS AGAIN!” He said as his eyes turned way inward 

“Give them to him Rick, I’m not gonna ask you one more time” I said. 

“Fine fine, here you go” He said as he threw them away from us “You guys can go on with your little stupid project, I don’t care. I’ll do it by myself and I won’t have to carry all of you in my shoulders” 

Liz ran towards the fallen glasses, picked them up and gave them to Kev. She literally had to hold Kevs hand cause he had no idea she was there nor what she was doing. 

“Don’t listen to him Kev, I think your glasses are cool. way cooler than mine at least” said Charlie 


“You don’t know what it has been like. Life for me felt like hell before I could find my shelter in music. I know my siblings are better looking than me, and is not just the vanity part of it, it’s the fact that each year I can see less: less color, less light, less details, and this will go on till I can’t see no more, and it hits me every night when I’m alone in my bedroom and I wash my face, and I don’t even try to open my eyes to see if I still have some soap. I just have memorized where my glasses are all the time so I don’t become an instant handicapped. And that’s how life is gonna be for me till I die” 


“I don’t think you’re bad looking at all Kev, if someone can’t look past your glasses… their loss” said Liz

“Guys we now have two missions: Number one: Prove Mrs. Natou we can do it. Number two: Proving Rick wrong. So DIOPTERS, Who’s in?”

“I am” Said Liz “Totally” said Charlie “Thank you guys, let’s prove the diopters aren’t a bad thing at all” said Kev. 

That was the day we became a real band.  No one would have guessed what happened next, we found our own style (A little bit like maroon 5 with a mix of guitar riffs like the ones Lenny Kravitz do) 

“Guys I was reading and I figured a way we can use Kev glasses on stage” said Liz as she handed us some sheets “See, there’s a site that has everything we need to know about glasses and stuff, I found there about something called GOC or glasses over contacts. YES it is exactly what it sounds like” 

“I don’t get it Liz, we can barely tolerate Kev glasses, how are we gonna wear contacts?” I asked

“Exactly, that’s the deal. We can barely tolerate them because we don’t need them. But what if we did? What if contacts could make us all see like Kevin does without glasses so we could wear his glasses?”

“That sounds interesting guys, but believe me you don’t want that” Said Kevin

“But it wouldn’t be permanent, as soon as we took the contacts off, everything would go back to normal. We just have to figure out the right prescription and that’s it.”

“Nice, I think it would help us next week. I haven’t told you guys but we have an appointment with the American Music Records executives to present our music. If they like it they will offer us to sign with them” I said. I could see their excitement but Liz was a little worried.

“Oh no, but this glasses take a little too long to make. Kev how many days did take the optician to give you your glasses?”

“Days? Try weeks now, two to be exact” Said Kev

“Damn, do you know your prescription?” I asked

“Yes, I have all my eye doctor files back home… if you want to I can ask my sister to bring them” 

“YESSS bro, please, tell her to bring your old glasses too, as soon as she is here, we’re going to my uncles. He is an ophthalmologist and he will help us figure this out” said Charlie

“So I guess we’ll figure this now and then we’ll dedicate time to rehearsal, is it ok?” I asked

“FINE” Everyone screamed



Kevin’s sister was there in about 30 minutes, she came in the room and I was absolutely surprised. She is perfect I thought, she is about 5’5, she isn’t too thin to say she is skinny, she has the body type Scarlet Johannson has… only little bit less boobs than Scarlet, but she has the prettiest face I’ve seen. She wears glasses too, but her glasses don’t look like the ones Kev wears. Hers do make hey eyes a little bit bigger, and you can see the power when she turns her head a little bit and the background distorts. 


“Hi everyone! I guess you are Kevins friends. I’m Gabrielle, her twin sister” 

OH MY GOD, I knew Kevin had a sister, but not a twin sister.

“Here’s everything you asked for” said Gabrielle handing mike a back pack. 

“We’re going to the ophthalmologist, wanna come?” I asked “Sure, count me in” Gabs said. 

That was a fascinating experience. Mr. Brooks was a little intrigued at first, but he understood our point and gave us a master class on the glasses matter. He said he could rush the order so we could have our contacts at least one day before our audition. 
 
Days flew by and I received a call “Oz, hurry up Charlie’s uncle already has our contacts”, I’ll pick you up in 10 minutes” said Liz, so I turned everything off and I went to wash my teeth. I would have taken a shower, but there was no time. After rehearsing by myself for 9 hours straight, I needed a coffee and that was more important than a shower right now. 

I was serving my yeti cup when I saw Liz’s car through the window, so I ran as fast as I could. I would have taken that shower if I knew Gaby was coming. 

When we were in Mr. Brooks, he told us we could not use Kevins glasses ‘cause he needs a prism correction, and he explained that contacts can’t correct or in this case simulate prims diopters, but he was able to order some glasses without the prism that we could use. 

Kevins glasses prescription read: 
OD.   SPH +17.50  / CYL +2.5 AXIS 148 / 8 BO     ADD +2.50
OS.   SPH +19.00 / CYL +1.75 AXIS 130 / 10 BO  ADD +2.50

Mr. Brook then gave each one of us a case and said, this is the best we could do in such short time. 

I had a red case, Liz a green one, Charlie a black one. 

“I thought things would be better if you changed things a little bit. Instead of all 4 of you wearing thick plus glasses, I gave Charly a strong minus prescription, he already has some myopia, but if he doesn’t feel comfortable, he can switch glasses with you guys. We would need to order some new contacts, but the glasses would work.”

“I love my glasses Uncle Brooks, I prefer small eyes… No offense Kev” Said Charlie “Non taken Charlie” answered Kevin. 

“Ok, so now let’s learn how to wear contacts then. First of all your hands have to be completely clean, this contacts are expensive and aren’t soft as the ones used in lower prescriptions, so they might take a little bit of time to get used to.” He then proceeded to show us how to insert our contacts and we all did.

I’ve never been so vulnerable in all my life. I couldn’t see anything, you know how some people say “I can’t see past my nose” well, I couldn’t even see that… Everything, everywhere I looked was blurry, I couldn’t even find my glasses case. “Oh shit, what do I do now? I can’t see anything!!! Is this what you see without your glasses Kevin?” 

“Hahaha yes bro, and I’m relieved by knowing you guys finally understand me, here you go, these are your specs” Kev said 

I tried them on and the world changed for me. I couldn’t see as good as I could without the GOC combination, but I felt unique. 

“Watch out Oscar, you might feel a little bit dizzy, the floor is probably gonna look like it’s moving” Said Mr. B

“OH MY GOD, I don’t feel nothing like that, It’s like I’m watching a movie in HD… Why am I seeing so good in these?” asked Charlie

“Cause your prescription is OD. SPH -20 / CYL -1.5  AXIS 180  and OS. SPH -19.5 / CYL -.25 AXIS 30, your glasses are MINUS, theirs are plus, they actually share the same prescription, but opposite, they will have to adapt to that spheric sensation plus glasses give. You were myopic already so I did the math to have you right on point when wearing the GOC combination, but if you take them off, you won’t see anything unless is super super close” Said Mr. Brooks 

Liz was very quiet, but I could see her excitement, “How you doing Liz?” Mr. B asked. “Fine Mr. B, I’m just amazed. I don’t need glasses and now I can’t believe I do” Liz said “As long as you wear those contacts, the glasses will do their job, but I do recommend you getting another pair cause if you are somewhere in public and your glasses fall off, you won’t have much choice than to take your contacts off to see, but people usually don’t carry their contacts case all the time”…

We had quite a while over there talking and sharing experiences, well tbh it was more of us listening to Gabs and Kev but time went by so quickly that when we went out, the sky was dark already.

“Ok guys, tomorrow is our big day. Wether we make it or we break it, anyway I want you guys to know how proud I am of us as a team, and Kevin we’re all really proud cause you were able to use the thing you dislike the most about you to create something very unique” I said

“Thank you guys, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I’m sure we can rock the f* out of the executives tomorrow.” Kevin replied 

We all went to our respective homes wearing our brand new glasses so we could get use to them. 





“Holy Molly Oscar, why are you wearing those things? You'll ruin your eyes!!!” Yelled my mom

“No mom, that’s the magical thing about this, I can wear these as much as I want and they won’t do any harm” I said. 

“Let me see those, said my brother” as he took them off from me “Ohh my god Oz, these are stupidly strong glasses dude, here” he said leaving my new glasses on the table, of course I couldn’t see anything, not even the glasses but I had to be cool since they were already so negative about me wearing them. I left them there as if I could see just fine, and I stood up and said “I’ll be here in a minute” and I headed to the bathroom. 

“Shit” I thought, I’ve left my contacts case and solution on my backpack in the dining table, so I screamed my brothers name for help “Shawn! Could you please give me my backpack?” I said sticking my hand out of the bathroom. When I felt my backpack I was relieved. I had to find my way through everything to grab the case and take the contacts out. I can’t believe Kev sees like this all the time without his glasses. I don’t know what I would do. 

I took the contacts out and felt better immediately, but to be completely honest, I felt something I never thought I would feel. My pants showed the excitement, if you know what I mean. So I went upstairs to my room, but first I took the glasses with me. I had to relive myself…



Next day came in slowly, I was nervous, anxious and excited. I got up, took a nice refreshing shower, and the first thing I did, even before dressing, was putting the contacts in. I stood there in front of the mirror, totally blind, not being able to even see my own body. I felt for the glasses and felt aroused like yesterday. I decided I had to do something again, so I took my glasses and grabbed my phone, I googled po*n videos and when I was watching a really good one I took my glasses off. It felt amazing not to be able to see my own phone, even if it being that close to me. 

Now I was ready to go. 

I picked up Kevin and Liz was already there, they have something going on, I can feel it. We met with Charlie on the American Music Records office. 

“Wow Charlie, your glasses look so different from the rest of us” Said Liz

“They do, don’t they? I really like them guys, It’s like watching the world through an HD tv” said Charlie

We were laughing and comforting each other when a very nice looking lady came to ask us to get in, so we did. 

“So, “The Diopters” huh? I can see now why you’ve chosen than name” Said Mr. Reagan 
I had no idea he was gonna be here, he is “THE MAN”, he has made famous almost every artist he has touched. 

“Are your glasses real or are those the kind of glasses that make people think you need them but you don’t?” Mr. Reagan asked 
“They’re completely real Mr.” Said Kevin as he took his off. He knew his eyes turned inward and that would help with the credibility of our glasses authenticity.

“Nice, I hate people with fake glasses. Now, show us what you can do…”

And we did. Things could have been a little bit better. I missed the pitch on one note and Charlie lost a beat but without any intention of bragging, we were damn good. 

“Wow, I’m impressed, and I’m very intrigued by how would a project like this work. You see, Hollywood is a rare place, people try to hide imperfections such as having bad eyesight and getting old, but I think a lot of people will connect with you. We need to review some contract clauses, but if you are in it, we are in” Mr Reagan said

“Oh my god Mr. Reagan THANK YOU, This is our biggest dream!” Said Liz “Well, yeah girl, but you still have a lot to prove.” was his answer.


What happened next was a lot of paperwork, lawyers and agreements to do… 



5 years latter: 

We have become a well known pop/rock band, I’ve been invited to coach “the voice” UK, we’re friends with Ellen Degeneres, we even gave Jennifer Aniston a little pug for her birthday, we’re on top now. 

I heard Rick became a full time employee at a music academy back home.

I’ve learned a lot about myself, and as you might have figured, I had a relationship with Gaby, Kevin’s sister, a few months ago. 

I love her with all my heart, but we want different things. 

One day we were at my place, and I’ve gotten used to wearing my glasses so much that I rarely take the GOC combination off, she was there wearing her own glasses. Sure, hers were weaker than mine, but they were about 8 diopters, so still pretty necessary to her sight. We were fooling around and I started kissing her, she was amazing at turning me on, that night she started to moan hard and to rub my pants til I was really really hard. She then unzipped my denim pants and took my manhood in one hand, I loved to see her with my glasses and them to look at her over them cause she became so blurry I couldn’t see her eyes. She went down all the way and gave me one of the best blows any one has given me, I was going to heaven right there, when she did something I wouldn’t have imagined. 
She took my glasses off and threw them at the wall, then she gave me hers and said she wanted to be “normal” for once. I grabbed the glasses but they did nothing to me, I could see a little less blurry but not enough to function. I came hard on her mouth and then I went running to see my glasses, they were broken. So I tried to talk to her, and all she said was how awful her childhood had been because of her glasses, and that she couldn’t stand glasses no more. My heart broke, I was in love with her, yes, but her glasses were part of the Gaby I knew. I’m sorry love, but I can’t be with someone who doesn’t understand that wearing glasses is my job now, I can’t just remove them, they are my trademark… I thought you understood.

A lot was said but we only saw each other a couple more times,  now we rarely see when The Diopters have a concert and she is in town. 

Charlie did something that had me thinking hard. He got his eyes “fixed” so he wouldn’t need contacts but would need glasses. He said he wen to Mexico and a doctor inserted a lens on his eyes and now he never needed to wear contacts. We had made enough money from The Diopters so Liz and I went to Mexico looking to get the same procedure. 

I feel like myself now, even if I have to wear invisible straps attached to my glasses, I feel amazing. 

Kevin and Liz are still together and I think Liz might have done something to become crosseyed, cause when she takes her glasses off to clean them, her eyes turn a little bit. Kevin told me he and Liz had been trying to get pregnant, they have sex almost everyday and while touring together I can confirm that. Liz likes to switch glasses with Kevin during sex, maybe that’s the reason she is a little crosseyed now. 


2 years latter:

I’m glad we started The Diopters together, we’ve met such amazing people all around the world. 
On our last trip to France, I Met Sacha and weird  things happened to me. I’ve always consider myself a straight man, but Sacha came to turn my world upside down. 

Let me describe you the first time I met Sacha: 

It was a typical French evening, clouds filling up the sky, elegant people walking through the champs elyssees trying to fit into the French stereotype. And right on the corner of my favorite french coffee house I saw a man siting on a wheelchair, looking through a window not realizing how bright the view was on this side of the glass. 
A waiter said “Mr. Couture would you like me to help you with your coffee?” “Yes please, he said”, then the waiter took the cup and gave it to him right on his mouth. I could see how he tried to help the waiter with his hand, but he couldn’t make his arm go higher than his chest. “I’ll be right back Mr. Couture, I need to deliver some orders”

I had to interfere: “That’s ok, If Mr. Couture lets me, I’ll take a coffee with him. He can teach me how to help him, only if he wants of course” I said
I could see Mr. Couture’s face going red, but he never lost his nerve and simply answered saying “My pleasure”

We spent hours talking about each other, he said he knew a few Diopters songs and that he used to paint, but when he was traveling to east Asia, someone had fired a gun and the bullet went straight to his spine leaving him quadriplegic. 
At first I felt bad for him, such a young, attractive, interesting man, but a few minutes latter I forgot he was injured. We laughed, we shared embarrassing things and we would have stayed there for years if the waiter hadn’t ask us to leave. 

“My place is near, I should call my care taker to pick me up” Said Sacha
“I could take you there, if you wanted me to” I sad

Sacha agreed and we “walked” to his house. He had an electric wheelchair so I walked slowly by his side listening to his stories and telling him mine. Three blocks down and we were on a very cool building “Wanna come?” He asked “Sure, let me help you” I sad. 

I never even thought of the fact that Sacha is a man, I was instantly in love with his spirit. We went up on an elevator and Sacha said  “I’m sorry I shouldn’t have asked you up so soon. Things aren’t the same when you are on a wheelchair. I need to empty my catheter now and that’s not a first date thing, I kinda have trouble moving my fingers and sometimes it gets messy” 

“Hey Sacha, come on. I don’t care boy, if you let me, in the most respectful way I could help you. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable” I sad

“No Oscar, thank you, but just give me a minute” He said as he wheeled to the bathroom

15 minutes went by and he came out “Ok, where were we?” I couldn’t help myself, so I stood up and went straight to his chair and started kissing him. He kissed me back and things got a little rough quickly 

I rubbed his pants but I didn’t know if “that” was gonna work, to my surprise it did, It wasn’t completely hard, but it was hard enough. I saw his hands trying to do the same to me and I got hornier instantly. He couldn’t move his fingers that much, I’m not sure if he felt them, but looking at him trying to grab my penis was a delightful experience. I went down and gave him the best bj I could, it was my first time but being a man I knew how it was supposed to be. My glasses kept sliding off my face so I took them off. Not being able to see anything just added a plus to the situation. He then asked me to help him into his bed, so I took his skinny legs and his waist and passed him from his chair to his bed. I went on top of him and I inserted my penis on his mouth. Oh my god, there I had an amazing man, who couldn’t move at all and that made me feel like I’ve never felt. 

Now we have the most amazing, romantic and sexual relationship. I help him with everything he needs, even though he still has a care taker, and he reads for me stuff I can’t see when my glasses are off at morning.

Life has been amazing, I couldn’t ask anymore of it, I’m going to Mexico next week to have “my eyes done”, The Diopters will be on tour next month and my love Sacha is coming with me <3
