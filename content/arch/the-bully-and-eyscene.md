The Bully, and EYESCENE.


I am not a very happy person, I am the oldest child, my younger sister gets all the attention.
Now I know, a way to get noticed.


To day, another girl in my class, came to school wearing glasses.
It did not take me long, to tease her about her glasses, and how awful she looked, to have her in tears.
Boy, that made me feel good, and also noticed.,that, nobody, really likes me anyway, and I am getting used to it..


To day, I discovered a new site on the computer.
The name is Eyscene.
A whole bunch of people, talking about liking of all things, wearing eyeglasses.
They use strange names, like weird eyes, sounmanpt, and tell each other all about vision, and glasses.
I noticed, that Cactus Jack, seems pretty smart, I wonder if he lives in the desert.
A lot of what they talking about does not make much sense to me.
I just got an idea, if I write in some stupid lines, I might get some reaction.




Now I am becoming a regular reader, on eyescene.
It is so much fun, to needle them, with stupid remarks, and foul language,
Yes, they sure take the bait, and get all upset.
The reaction, I get, is well worth it, they are all upset, and feel like wringing my neck,.
I never had so much fun.


I don t know, but I am very disappointed, that lately, they seem to ignore my remarks, and have their regular conversation, completely ignoring me.
I don t like that.
Some real dirty remarks, might get them going again.
So I inserted some real foul language.
Dam! They are ignoring my remarks again, I will try again next week.


It has been over a week now, that I have not had any reaction, they are completely ignoring me.
I am ready to give up, they are not paying any attention, and comments.
Going to the eyescene site, has not been much fun lately, they are ignoring my ramarks.


My parents gave me hell to day.
My teachers report, was not very good.
All my grades are way down, and they are complaining, about me being a bully.
They also informed me, that my sister and I are having an eye exam, next week
My sister, has trouble reading what is on the blackboard, and they think, I might have a vision problem to, the cause of my low grades.


Me, an eye exam, what are they thinking, my vision is perfect.
I don t want to be like the people on eyescene, crazy about wearing glasses, I hate glasses.



It has been about two weeks now, that I , had no comment on my remarks, on the eyescene site.
I guess, they figure ignore it, and it will go away.
They are right, why bother, if you cannot get any reaction.


We had our eye exams, to day.
My sister is myopic, and has to wear glasses, like we all expected.
The biggest surprise was, when I was told, that I have a lot of astigmatism, and have to wear glasses, full time.
Me wearing glasses, no way, people will make fun of me.


Two days later, we were back at the optical store to pick up our glasses.
My sister is so happy, with her improved vision, and also loves her new look, and wears her glasses proudly, silly girl.
When the optician, handed me my glasses, and I put them on, did not like what I saw.
In the distance everything looked fuzzy, and when I looked at myself, my eyes looked bigger.
My eyes, sure did not feel quite right looking through the lenses, what are they doing to me.
Young man, after you wear these glasses full time for at least 2 weeks, you will be very pleased with your eye sight, and wearing the glasses, will make reading much easier for you.
My mother was right there, and heard every word, and no way, was I going to be seen without wearing glasses.


When I came home, I took solace in my computer.
When I went to eyescene to look for any remarks, dam, there were not any..
What got my attention, Cactus Jack, explained about, astigmatism, and corrective lenses, and I found it very interesting, the way he explained it.
Now I know, why I have to wear glasses, full time, so I better get used to wearing them.
Perhaps, Eyescene, is not that bad a site, after all,
