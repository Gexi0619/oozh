What a pleasant, and educating visit.


Hi !. my name is Wendy, the only girl in our household, with two older brothers.
Both my brothers, are very athletic, and play on our high school football team.
I am one of the cheer leaders, which is a lot of fun and it keeps me in shape.




There is one guy on the football team, that I would like to know better, I think he is my type, he is well build, good looking,
has a nice smile, what else can you ask for?
When I asked my brother about him, he said, good luck, all the girls are after him, I think Jim, is the most popular guy in
our school.




When we had a school dance, I could not believe it, when Jim asked me to dance with him. 
He is a good dancer, and we had a great time, and I could not believe my ears, when he asked me for a date.




Jim and I went to see a movie, and we soon enjoyed a bit of necking, while watching the movie.
After the show, we both had a bit of a headache, from sitting to far away from the screen.
I had some painkiller in my purse, which looked after the problem, while we enjoyed some refreshments.




During the summer, after graduating from high school, we dated regularly,
until Jim left, to join the football team at the university, where he got a scholar ship, to look after his tuition, and housing.
With a big smile, he told me, that he will see me again, after he graduates.




Joining, a university football team, is hard work, I spend every day training and to be, as good as I can, before the cut.
I was fortunate, I made the cut, and when the lectures start, I will be very busy.




On thing, that I will never forget, that after the game, when, everybody showers, and walks 
around in their birthday suit, I would look at myself, to make sure, I had nothing to be ashamed off, I now know, I look 
just as good.,as all the rest of them



The next 3 years, went fast, between football and studies, there was not much time left.
I graduated with honours, and now, I am looking forward, to my employment, in our home town.




After graduating from high school, I enrolled in a business computer and office management course,
and after graduating, was hired, by a law firm.
I enjoy my work, and the people I work with.




Jim, is back in town, he phoned me last night, and asked me to go for dinner with him.
When we met, kissed each other, and Jim complimented me, on how nice I looked.
After a very cozy, and enjoyable dinner, we went to see a movie.
On the way to the theatre, we both complained about all the halo’s around the car lights., and how annoying that was,
and why are all the traffic signs, are harder to read now.
In the theatre we were sitting in the area we like to sit, but after a while, we both complained about the quality of the picture,
we found that the picture looked fuzzy, we did not enjoy it and left early.




Lately I have seen many of our classmates, and noticed how different, and more mature most of them look.
I noticed that some of them are wearing glasses now, and look really nice, wearing glasses.




A few weeks later we decided, we should pay for one apartment only, and we moved in together.
Now we are living in a nice apartment, in a large building, that we both like.
We had a lot of fun, getting the right furniture, to make it look like home.




To day, when I went to the apartment mailbox, to see if there was any mail, I met Geoff, 
one of our high school class mates.
We had a nice chat, and told me, he had married Carolyn, and they had moved into the building last week.
Geoff, had been one of the football players, on our school team.
So, I invited him and Carolyn, to come over for a drink, and watch a football game, with Jim on Saturday.
That sounds great, we will be there.




When, I told Jim about inviting Geoff and Carolyn, Jim thought it was a good idea and would be fun.
He likes Geoff, but cannot remember Carolyn.
Carolyn, is a very pleasant girl, she never looked real pretty, with her mousy coloured, straight brown hair.
Yes, I think, I remember her now. 
Geoff and I will be talking football, while you girls, get up to date on all the women’s news.




I am glad to morrow is Saturday, I have a head ache, and all the legal documents, I have printed to day look, fuzzy to me, 
and the service man was here yesterday, and told me the printer was working perfect. 




Saturday after getting ready for our visitors, I heard a knock on the door
What a shock I got, when I opened the door, and there was Geoff, with a beautiful, blonde, glasses wearing woman.
Carolyn, if I had met you on the street, I would not have recognized you, you look so nice.
Thank you.
The boys sat down with a beer, and chips, to talk football, while watching the game.
Carolyn and I sat down at the kitchen table, ready for a pleasant chat.




When I talked with Carolyn, she told me, that her mother, while she was in high school, would not let her do anything
nice with her hair, and she sure did not like make up.
So, I never got a chance to do, what I liked to do, with my hair, and my looks.
When I got a good job, and had a bit of money, I let my hair grow long, coloured my hair, and started to use make up. 
Geoff, liked what I did, and shortly after, we got married, and then moved into this building, about three months ago.
I now feel so much better, about my appearance, and feel more confident.
Carolyn, you look so nice wearing glasses, how do you like wearing them? 
I love wearing my glasses, I can see so much better wearing glasses.
Since I started to wear glasses, I feel more grown up and confident.
How long have you been wearing glasses?
A little over two years, I had trouble driving at night, hated all the halos around the car lights, and I found traffic signs 
hard to read, until I was close to them.
One of the girls at work, suggested I should have an eye exam, because she had experienced, the same trouble, 
and after she started to wear glasses, her vision is almost perfect. 
Last week, I had and another eye exam, and needed a little stronger prescription, and to day I picked up the glasses, 
that I am wearing row, and I love them.
Carolyn, believe it or not, lately I seem have, the same kind of vision problems, that you mentioned, do you think, 
I should be wearing glasses?
I don’t know, you need an eye exam, to tell you..
I wonder, what I will look like wearing glasses?
You be surprised, how good you can look wearing glasses, there are so many nice frames now, 
I think anybody can look good wearing glasses.
Well, I guess I have something to think about, and discuss it with Jim.
Carolyn opened her purse to get a Kleenex, and said to me, oh, here, I will show you my first pair of glasses, 
that is how I looked wearing them, and she put her old glasses on.
I cannot believe, how good you look wearing glasses, I am wondering, can I look that good wearing glasses
Wendy, why don’t you try my glasses, and look at your self wearing the glasses, you might be pleasantly surprised.
I put Carolyn’s old glasses on, and got a very strange feeling, when looking through the lenses,
It gave me the feeling somebody, flipped a switch, everything I looked at was, so much more clear, sharp, 
and well defined ,and sexy, unbelievable.
I walked to a mirror, and looked at myself, and was really surprised, that I looked so good wearing glasses.
Walking around, wearing the glasses, I looked out the window, and now was able to see everything, far away, so nice and clear.
When I tried Carolyn’s new glasses, everything looked even better, and could see a church tower, I had never seen before.
Well now, I understand, why you like wearing glasses, the improvement in my vision is unbelievable,
and the glasses are so comfortable to wear.
Now I am sure, that I need, and want to wear glasses.
I gave Carolyn her, new glasses back, but could not resist, to put her old glasses on again..
Wendy, it seems you like wearing glasses.
Yes, I do, they are good looking, and I can see better, and they are comfortable to wear, I cannot wait to get my own glasses.
I could not believe, how good I felt wearing the glasses, and I did not want to take them off.
Wendy, why don’t you keep the glasses, so you can wear them, until you get your own.
Yes, I would like that.
We talked about a lot of other things, while we were waiting, for the pizza to be ready, so we could feed the guys.






Girls, the game is finished, where is the pizza, we can smell it.
It is coming in a minute, we are just cutting it.
We took some plates, and the pizza, and went into the living room.
I forgot, I was still wearing Caroline’s old glasses.
Wendy, why are you wearing glasses?
Jim, I let me tell you. 
You mean to say, you went to buy glasses and did not tell me?
No Jim, the glasses I am wearing, are Caroline‘s old glasses, how do I look?
Let me have a good look, so I walked closer to Jim, so he could see my face.
You look different, but I think, I might like that look, your eyes look brighter and very nice.
Then, I told him whole story, and that I could see perfectly, even when, I wore Caroline’s new glasses.
Now I know, that I have to go for an eye exam, and get my own glasses.
Well I guess you do, and perhaps, I should also go and have an eye exam , we both have the same vision problems.
Do you mind, if I keep wearing Caroline’s old glasses,?
No, I don’t, you are going to be wearing glasses, that gives me a chance to get used to your new look, which I kind of like.






The following week, I made eye appointments for both of us.
The timing was perfect, because Jim, received a notice, to renew his drivers license, including a vision test


.


We walked into the optical office, and after checking in and filling out some papers, I was called in for my eye exam.
I had forgotten to take Caroline’s old glasses off, and the optician took them to check the prescription. 
After the exam, was finished the Doctor told , there was quite an increase in my prescription, 
and a change in my astigmatism correction.
While Jim had his eye exam, the optician assisted me a selecting a frame.
I selected a nice frame, which, I really liked the looks off.
It is a larger, and a nice coloured frame, that blends perfect with my hair and skin tone.
The optician took the regular measurements, and was finished with me when Jim came out.
Yes, I am prescribed to wear glasses all the time, now I have to find a nice frame.
After I showed Jim, the frame that I had selected, said it looked fantastic, now let’s find a frame for me.
It did not take long, to find a frame for him, that we both liked.
Now we had to wait for our glasses, which should be ready the next day.


.


We were both, looking forward to our new glasses, when we went to get them.
After, we were both fitted, and ready to go home, and talking about how wonderful our new glasses were, 
Jim suggested we go and see a movie, and try out our new glasses.
When we were sitting near the back of the theatre , we both enjoyed the nice clear picture.
On the way home Jim said, I am glad you invited Geoff and Caroline, it was a real educational visit.
Now both of us, are able to see properly wearing our glasses, all, because of your conversation with Caroline,
That sure was a pleasant and educational visit.
