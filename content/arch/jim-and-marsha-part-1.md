Jim was a handsome boy, a good student, interested in track and field, sports in general.He would be going back to high school 
in September.
Jim was the oldest of 3 children in a happy family. His dad had a good job, so his mother was able to stay home ans raise the family.
Since his mother was myopic and familiar with eye care the family had regular eye exams.
The next exam was due and an appointment was made.
Jim was not to worried until he had to read the eye chart and had trouble reading the third line.
The doctor gave Jim a very thorough exam, and when finished said sorry young fellow, you need to wear glasses.
Jim came out of the examination room not to happy, he had not expected this verdict.
Since he usually sat in the front of the class and did not have any trouble reading, he sure did not expect this.
His mother helped him select a smart looking frame, and assured him that wearing glasses was not the end of the world ,and to make the most of it  because he would appreciate being able to see everything better.
2 Days later Jim got his new glasses ad he was surprised how much better everything looked.
The reception he received from his classmates surprised him. The girls remarked how handsome he looked.
And his friends just asked a whole bunch of questions and of course had to try the glasses.
Jim felt much better now and started to appreciate his glasses, and he thought he looked pretty good wearing them.
Wearing glasses helped him a lot when hitting and fielding playing base ball
When he went jogging his glasses did not bother him.
The summer went by fast, he had a good time with his friends and starting looking forward to going back to school.


Marsha.
Marsha was an only girl ,she had an older brother,and she loved her parents.
Marsh was a pretty girl with auburn shoulder length hair with a bit of curl.
She always had a big smile and had a great personality. She enjoyed running and did it often with her brother.She also like playing the piano.
Her best friend Peggy, a blond haired girl was a friendly  gal and had a lot of the same interests.
Both girls were looking forward to going back to high school, and were exited about it.

In the end of August ,Peggy went for an eye test and ended up wearing glasses, she was slightly myopic and had some astigmatism.
Marsha was very surprised when she saw Peggy wearing glasses.The girls talked about it, and Peggy explained that 
everything in the distance looked fuzzy and not very clear, so her mother decided she should have her eyes tested.
She had nice brown plastic frames that looked really good on her.
She asked Marsha if she wanted to try her glasses, Marsha said she had never tried glasses on and wanted to try them.
She carefully took the glasses and put them on her face, they felt nice and when she looked around, everything seemed a bit clearer and more defined than before and she was really surprised about the difference.

So what do you think asked Peggy,Marsha thought that everything looked a clearer,but she did not think she needed glasses.
Peggy like her glasses and was very happy with them, and the glasses sure looked great on her.

So the girls were getting excited about going back to school, and planned a trip to the mall to get their school supplies
and be ready for the new school year.
