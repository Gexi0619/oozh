Linda was in her early teens, the middle girl in a myopic family.  Her father and mother has been wearing glasses since they were in public school. Her older brother had been wearing glasses since grade 3, and her younger sister started wearing glasses last year, when they had their yearly eye exam.   Since Linda was in high school now, she was wondering when she would need glasses, she wanted to wear glasses. Wearing glasses seemed to be no problem, she never heard anybody at home complaining about them.
Most of their relations wore glasses, and she always felt glasses were an important part of a persons appearance, she felt left out not wearing glasses,  and wondered if she could do something about it.  Then she found an article on the computer about induced myopia, the way she understood it was that,when you are young and still growing, and wore a pair of glasses with a myopia prescription, that you might become myopic, it was certainly worth a try.
It did not take long for her to find an older pair of her brothers glasses in a drawer and took them to her bedroom and tried them on.
She looked at herself in the mirror and liked the looks of the glasses, they made her feel like part of the family.
She noticed that wearing the glasses put some strain on her eyes and everything looked a little blurry, but the glasses felt comfortable. She liked the looks of her eyes behind the lenses and decided she was going to wear them as much as possible, it might help her get her own glasses. She started to wear the glasses at school, and it did not take long for her to notice that she could see a little better each day when wearing the glasses. She also noticed that when she took the glasses off everything looked blurry . So she kept on wearing the glasses every chance she got, and was hoping that this way she might become myopic and get her own glasses.
She was a very happy girl, when the next time they went for their annual eye exam at Jones Optical, Dr.Jim told her she now needed to wear glasses. The prescription was -1.25 for the right and - 1.75 for the left eye. 
She was all excited selecting a nice frame, and when her glasses were ready and put them on, loved the looks and feel of her own new glasses and wore them proudly.   She received a lot of compliments on her new look, and was happy wearing glasses, now she felt like a member of the family.
She noticed that looking at the glasses her parents and older brother were wearing, that the lenses seemed to show some ring, and looked a little different than hers, their eyes seemed to look a little brighter and nicer, she liked the looks of that.
Realizing that the prescription in the glasses they were wearing was stronger than hers , she could not wait for her own stronger prescription, so she could have that look to, she would like that.
Being a good looking girl, she was popular with the boys, and had quite a few dates. She realized that the boys she preferred to date all wore glasses.  She would love to date Ken, he was her favorite, he was myopic and his lenses showed a lot of rings and the edges of his lenses were noticeable thicker, she thought he looked fantastic and very handsome wearing those glasses, but he had a girlfriend.
After graduating from high school, Linda went to college to become an optician.  She liked the course , it was so interesting learning all about the different types of lenses, contact lenses, checking completed prescriptions, adjusting frames and everything else about the optical business. 
Her own prescription now was -2.50 for the right and -2.75 for the left eye, and she noticed some rings showing in the lenses, which made her very happy, she loved the looks of the rings ,the more the better.

One day at the college cafeteria Linda met Carl, a student who took a different course, when he bumped into her and upset her lunch. He apologized , asked her to please sit down, bought her a new lunch brought it to her, and sat down.
He introduced himself and apologized again.  Linda smiled and accepted his apology. He was quite talkative and she enjoyed  his company, he was a personable guy, had a great smile, and was easy to talk to, his only shortcoming was , he did not wear glasses.
When they were to return to their classes, Carl asked Linda if she would like to go to the movies with him, she accepted and they would meet at the Mall Saturday afternoon at the food court.
Linda was looking forward to her date, she had not had one for a while , and Carl seemed like a nice guy.
Carl was waiting for her when she got there, greeted he with a big smile, and asked her which movie she would like to see and then bought their tickets. 
They enjoyed the movie and afterwards went to the food court for some refreshments.
Carl asked Linda to excuse him while he took some pain killers for his headache.
Linda asked him if he had headaches often and Carl said lately once and a while, I found the movie a bit blurry, that might have caused it. Have you ever had an eye exam asked Linda, Carl said no , I can see just fine.
Linda did not believe him, she saw a board on the wall with the menu on it , and asked Carl if he could tell her the price of a seafood salad. Carl looked at the menu board, got up to walk closer to it , and told her it was $ 3.50.
Linda smiled and said since you could not see the prices from where we are were sitting, I am sure you need to think of an eye exam, I have no trouble reading it from here.
Carl was surprised and said I never realized I cold not see as well as I should, you think I might need glasses? 
What is it like to wear glasses?
Linda told him it was nothing to worry about, you can see everything  so much better, and they are very comfortable, you don t even realize you are wearing them.
You think I will look all right wearing glasses ? Linda assured him he would look very handsome and suggested he go with her 
to Jones Optical across the street, and he could try some frames and see what he would look like wearing glasses.
When they entered the store Linda told Marsha that they would like to try some frames , to see how Carl would look wearing glasses.
After trying a lot of different frames Carl agreed he would not look to bad wearing glasses, and made an appointment for an eye exam.

Carl asked Linda if she would mind going with him for his eye exam since she was more familiar with optical procedures , and if he needed glasses help with the frame selection. She told him she be glad to help.
After the exam and being told he needed to wear glasses, Carl and Linda selected a frame that looked to be made for Carl.
After proper  measurements were told to come back later and the glasses would be ready., so they went to the Mall to wait.
Marsha called Linda on her cell and told her Carl s glasses were ready.
Linda was all excited and Carl was not too happy when they went back to Jones Optical. 
Marsha asked Carl to take a seat,put the glasses on him, made some adjustments and then asked him to look around.
Carl could not believe the improvement in his vision, and when looking at himself in the mirror was  pleasantly surprised with his looks.  Linda and Marsha both told him he looked fantastic, which made Carl smile and feel better having to wear glasses.

Carl and Linda were now going steady , and enjoyed each others company.
After graduating , Linda started to work at Jones Optical, since Marsha wanted to spend more time with her young family.
After Linda s last eye exam, her prescription had only increased by half a diopter  and was very disappointed she really wanted stronger lenses , she just loved the looks of them. when she found the site of Vision and Spex on the computer , and read about glasses over contacts, to give you that exciting look and feel of strong lenses, she would like that.
She asked Dr.Jim about it. He told her he had done some G.o.C.when he was at the university and had liked it, but Marsha did not.
He told her if she wanted to try it he would figure out the proper lens  and contact prescription, and asked her what lens strength she was thinking of, she told him she would like to try - 15.00. She told him she had worn contact lenses and they were no problem, but she preferred wearing glasses. So Dr. Jim gave her the proper prescription  for lenses and contacts and they were ordered.
When the lenses came in Linda put them i a frame that really showed the stronger lenses , Then she took her glasses off ,put in her contact lenses, and all she could see was a big blur, which changed into an exciting feeling when she put the glasses on.
Then she looked around    which gave her an exciting feeling, than looked in the mirror and loved the way she looked, she loved the looks of the lenses, everything was the way she had wanted it.
She wore he G.o.C. the rest of the day and just loved the feel and looks of them.
That night she had a date with Carl. When he saw her wearing the new glasses, could not believe his eyes, and told Linda he loved her new look and thought she looked fantastic
It was then that he told her that he had really liked the looks of her glasses and the pretty girl that wore them, had caused the lunch accident on purpose , to get to meet  her , and the new glasses are like icing on a cake, fantastic.
Linda had no idea that Carl had liked her glasses that much, and how he felt about them , and it made her very happy.
She then told him that she had always preferred the looks of men who wore glasses.
Well thanks to you, I can now see properly and discovered that wearing glasses is great, I like wearing them.
Carl said I think I like to go for G.o.C. I love that look. Would you mind? Can you help me?
Linda said no problem, I will talk  to Dr, Jim and get everything ready.
The following week Carl came to Jones Optical, Linda had everything ready.
After Carl put in his contact lenses and then put on the glasses Linda could not believe how good he looked  and gave him a big kiss.
When Carl looked at himself , smiled and said I love the looks and the lenses make me feel different , they give me a a great feeling, and sexy.
Linda agreed and said O.K. come to my place after work, we will wear our G.o.C. have dinner and spend the evening enjoying our selves wearing G.o C.
