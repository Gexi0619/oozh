I'm Simon. I am 19 years old and am the youngest of 3 kids in my family. Both my parents and sisters wear glasses so it was no suprise when I started 4th grade and struggled to read the board. I was prescrubed glasses with a prescription of -0.75 in both eyes with a little bit of astgnatism. I only wore that pair of glasses when I needed to see the board at school or when I went to the movies. I managed to watch TV without them at home by just sitting closer to the screen. The occasional glasses wearing was shortlived, becuase in 5th grade my prescription increased to the point where the doctor reccomended I wear them full time so I would never be in a situation where I needed to see but didn't have them. My prescription was -1.25 now, with -0.75 of astigmatism in both eyes, up from the -0.25 the year before.

In 5th grade I had also started playing club basketball and was actually fairly good despite playing without glasses. Since I had always found those sports-goggles ugly, I opted not to wear any correction on the court. I would take my glasses off and put them in my bag in the lockerroom before practice so my coach didn't even know I had bad eyesight. I played very well for the first few months, but about half-way through the year my performance started to drop. I was having trouble making baskets and sometimes I would pass the ball to the other team by mistake. At a certain point, my coach asked me what was going on. I told him i didn't know. He spoke to my mom who put together that my eyes might have gotten worse and a visit to the eye doctor was in order.

So during the summer between elementry and middle school (5th and 6th grade), I went to the eye doctor again, and low and behold my prescription now read: 
R -2.00 x -1.25 132 
 L -1.75 x -1.75 098
Since it was pretty clear that I now needed to wear glasses on the court, my mom suggested I get contact lenses. I was intregued by the idea and decided to give it a try. The doctor showed me how to put in the lenses  and take them out, and within an hour I was out of the office with a pair of trial lenses in my eyes, and a weeks worth of dailies in my pocket. It was so cool being able to see so clearly without even wearing glasses. The first time I wore my new contacts on the court, my game improved dramatically and my coach was really impressed.

I enjoyed wearing contacts so much that throughout middle and highschool, I don't think I ever wore my glasses to school. I think the only people who knew about my bad eyesight were my family, close friends, and the few girls I had dated in highschool who stayed the night at one point or another. When I graduated highschool, I was  one of if not the most athletic guys in my grade. I had a nice set of abs, chissled V, and was very muscular. Girls were all over me, and by the time I started college I was quite experienced in the bedroom, My glasses prescription had also stopped increasing by this point and I was steady at:
R -4.25 x -0.75 138
L -3.75 x -1.25 102

When I started college, I found myself wearing my glasses about as often as I did my contacts. Kyle was my freshman year roommate. We got along very well and quickly became good friends. He was a really good roomate too. He was tidy and would always give me the room if I ever wanted to bring over a girl I had met for sex. What I had noticed about Kyle was that he squinted a lot. I never mentioned it as I thought he probably had a pair of glasses with a low enough prescription that he could get by without them and just chose not to wear them. One day our university was having a life fair where a bunch of banks, medical practices, food vendors, and more gathered on the quad to help educate college students on the different services they might need as they enter adulthood. 

Kyle and I were supposed to meet some mutual friends at the fair. It was crowded and being only 5' 6" (my basketball feats are more impressive now, right?) I couln't see over the crowd. Kyle was taller than me at 5' 10" so he tried to look for the others. He scrunched up his face more than I had ever seen him do in the past, and as if almost giving up say a bit under his breath: "I'm can't see shit. I really need to get some contacts." 

I started to feel my dick in my pants. This was the first time Kyle had ever mentioned his bad eyesight. Slightly concerned about what has happening to my penis, slightly excited by the possibilities of where the converstion could go, I responded: "Yeah, I've kinda noticed you squint a lot. If you're sturggling why don't you wear your glasses?"

Much to my surprise, Kyle casually replied: "I don't have glasses. I've always hated the idea of them, and so just never got them."

I felt my dick get a little harder.

I proceeded to tell Kyle that I thought I'd seen an optical shop in a pamphlet for the event so there shouold be a booth he could visit. Kyle asked one of the nearby vendors where he could "get some contacts," to which the vendor replied: "Clarity Optical has a booth all the way down at the end, I belive they have a mobile optical shop with same day service and eye exams available. But you'd better hurry, I think their same day services end at 2:00pm." It was 1:30pm. Kyle thanked the man, and said: "I'll look into it." Then he said to me: "I don't think we can get through the whole fair by then."

3 things to note: My and Kyle's university was large, but it was in the middle of nowhere, and all the local businesses which served the university used this as an opportunity to price gouge students who had no alternatives. Second, Clarity Optical is known for their affordable budget-friendly services which is why the university had partnered with them for this event rather than one of the more local glasses stores. And third, Kyle was right: the life far was such a large event that if we walked through as we were planning to, there was no way we would make it across the quad in 30 minutes. 

Still excited about the circumstances, as we started making our way through the fair, in a tone of slight disbelief, I asked Kyle: "So you've never tried a pair of glasses?" "No" he replied.

I happened to be wearing my glasses instead of my contacts that day. I took them off and handed them to Kyle. "Here, try mine." With a little reluctance, Kyle brought the frames to his face. As his eyes peered through the curved plastic windows I could (sort of, remember he had my glasses) see his whole face light up. With the glasses resting on his nose Kyle said: "holy shit, is this how the world is supposed to look?"

Blood rushed to my penis faster than it ever had before, worried that it might peirce through my jeans, I said: "Yup!" I was now faced with trying to conceal a full on boner, in fact probably the biggest boner I'd ever had. I think I did a pretty good job, but I think Kyle did get a small glimpse of what was happening as he gave me a little grin. 

"You know what, we can see the rest of the booths after we hit up Clarity Optical, this is a priority!" said Kyle as he took off my glasses and handed them back to me. "Thanks." I siad. As we made our way over to the Clarity Optical booth, I texted the friends we were supposed to meet what our new plan was. When we arrived at the booth, we were greeted by a young woman, maybe 3 or 4 years older than us, wearing a name-tag which read: Tracey. 
She siad: "Welcome to Clarity Optical's mobile optical store! We are offering free eye exams and same-day glasses to students today. Can I help you boys with anything?

"I sure hope so!" said Kyle. "What's going on? asked Tracey in a slightly concerned tone. "Well, I've noticed for quite some time that my vision hasn't been so great, but about 10 minutes ago I tried on my friends glasses and was amazed by how much better everything looked. So I came right over" replied Kyle. 

Tracey: "We can certainly give you an eye-exam. I've got one student in the exam room with the doctor right now, but you will be next. In the meantime though, I can get you started."
Kyle: "Thank you."
Tracey: "What's your name?"
Kyle: "Kyle Lawson"
Tracey: "Date of Birth?"
Kyle: "November 6, 2002"
Tracey: "Stand over here Kyle" as she pointed to a line on the ground 10 feet away from an eye chart.
Kyle and I walked over to the line.
Tracey: "Cover your left eye and read me the lowest line you can see."
Kyle: "E"
Tracey: "Anything else?"
Kyle squinted heavily.... "T... F...?" I peered over my frames, I couldn't see anything on that chart. Regardless, the boner I was trying to conceal, felt as if it got even harder, which i didn't know was even possible. 
Tracey: "What about with the other eye>"
Kyle: 
         "L P...
          T D... N... "
        "Ugh, I don't know?"
Tracey: "Thanks Kyle, I've got all the information I need, the doctor will be with you shortly. In the meantime, feel free to look at some frames while you wait."

Tracey went over to help some more students who had rocked up while she was testing Kyle's visual accuity. Kyle and I looked at some frames for him. Seeing him try on glasses kept me going, this was definately the longest and strongest boner I'd ever had. Kyle tried on a bunch of frames from their limited selection, none of which he really liked, before the doctor called him into the super small exam room located at the back of the converted RV.

While Kyle had his eye exam I had a chance to think about what was going on with my penis. I was confused. I had never had a problem getting aroused for sex, but this was something different. Soon though, my penis began to shrink back to its flacid size. Luckily I am a shower more than a grower so I'm used to having a bulge visible in my pants and my boner was not extremely noticable, especially behind the tight jeans I was wearing that day. 

After about 30 minutes, Kyle came out of the exam room with a giant smile across his face. "Wow! I can't belive I waited so long!" Kyle was wearing a pair of trial contacts. "The doctor asked me what your prescription is Simon." said Kyle. "I'm not entirly sure what my glasses are, but contacts are R -4.25 and L -3.75 with astignatism in both eyes." I replied. The doctor chimed in and said: "So Kyle, that's why these contacts are even more clear than when you tried your friends glasses. His eyes are still a bit worse than yours, so when you tried his glasses, your eyes were trying to accomodate the extra power. With your prescription your eyes can see clearly and relax while doing it." 

"What's your prescription, Kyle?" Kyle looked at the two boxes of trial lenses he had been provided. The one marked R said -3.25, and the one marked L said -2.50. When Kyle told me those numbers, boy was I surprised. I told him how insane it was that he lasted this long with that amount of myopia. I told him my first prescription was -0.75 in both eyes. Kyle then chose a pair of glasses he could tolerate, and we went to check out the rest of the life fair while we waited for his glasses to be made in the mobile lens lab. We met up with our friends and checked out the banks and food vendors with booths at the event.

All afternoon, Kyle had a huge smile across his face. Clearly he was enjoying his new crisp vision. Seeing him happy made me happy. We went to pickup his glases on our way back to our dorm. Tracey asked him to put them on so she could check the sizing. Kyle kept his eyes closed since he was not used to that much minus power at a time, even just to briefly check the fit of the square plastic frames on his face. He took off the glasses and put them in their case, and we headed back to our dorm.

I went to the gym while Kyle called his family to tell them about his afternoon. When I got back I saw Kyle looking at the ring around his iris left by the contact lens sitting on his eyeball and smiling. I felt my dick starting to enlarge a little. "Liking them?" I asked. "You have no idea!" he said.

I quickly ran to the shower, and when I came back put on a comfy pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. "Hey Simon? Can I ask you a question?" asked Kyle. "What's up?" I replied. "How do I take these out?" he asked. "Did they not teach you duing your appointment?" I aksed, in shock! "No." I guess thats what you get for a free eye exam. Luckily, Kyle had me to ask but I couldn't get the idea of what would happen if he didn't out of my head. I said I'd show him, and quickly grabbed a pair of contacts off my dresser and put them in. While I waited for the astignatism weight to set and my vision to clear up, I sent Kyle to wash his hands. 

I showed Kyle how to take out his contacts by taking out my own, and then sat down on my bed while I watched him get them out. Kyle had already gotten ready to go to the shower when he realized he needed to take out his contacts, so he was just wearing a towel secured around his waiste. It took him a few minutes standing in front of the mirror and prying at his eyeballs before he got both lenses out. "Back to crappy vision" he said. I tossed him the case with his glasses which was sitting on the nightstand between our beds. He sighed out of frustration. He hated that unless he wore contacts he needed to wear glasses to see clearly. "Just try them" I said. He took the glasses out of the case and put them on his face. His face lit up again, but this time even more as it had when he tried my glasses on. I couldn't help myself.

My dick practically doubled in size, and this time my sweatpants, unlike my jeans, couldn't hide it. Kyle must have been feeling the same way, because I the area towards the top of his towel began to protude, and kept protruding until it untied the towel wrapped around his waiste and dropped to the floor. "Come here!" I said. Kyle leaped onto my bed as I took off my sweatpants to catchup. That was both of our first times having gay sex, but it wasn't the last. 

Kyle and I began to be more than just roommates that night, and we both got a clearer view of our selves. Prior to that day, I had never noticed men or people wearing glasses. I now walk around campus and enjoy looking at these groups of people, but nobody will every beat my Kyle.
