We love wearing glasses




Ever since I can remember I have always been fascinated with eyeglasses.
I don t know why, nobody in our family wears glasses.
To day my niece and her mother came for a visit,
I noticed right away that Kim wore glasses.
I told her how nice she looked, and I had a chance to try her glasses.
The frame felt so nice on my face, and when I looked in the mirror loved the way I looked wearing the glasses.
When I looked around, could see reasonably well.
Now I am sure I want to wear glasses.

At school I am always jealous, when I see a student wearing glasses, why them and not me?
I spend a lot of time on the computer to learn as much as I can about eyes and vision,
Understanding myopia and presbyopia, the type of lenses and how to tell what they are, when looking at the glasses wearer.

A new school year, I am going into the next grade in high school.
I have a couple of girl friends, they don t like glasses and don t even want to talk about them.
To day in math class I sat close to a very pretty girl with beautiful curly hair and she wore glasses.
I said hello to her and she smiled, and after class she came over to talk to me.
She told me, I am Nicole, glad to meet you, I am Ashley.
She told me she is new in town, and best of all is when I found out that she lives on the street where I live.
I made sure she was going to be my friend.
We started to walk home together and talked about a lot of different things.
On Saturday she came over to our house,,
We had lots to talk about, and after a while I brought up my favorite subject, glasses.
I told her how nice she looks wearing glasses..
Thank you, I love wearing glasses.
Then she told me that her mother wears glasses, she is myopic like me, and wears a -7.50 prescription.
I love the looks of her lenses so much, I hope my prescription is going to be about the same as hers.
Nicole how long have you been wearing glasses?
I started to wear glasses about 4 years ago.
Then I told her how I have always loved the looks of glasses and would like nothing better than having to wear glasses.
Can I try your glasses, please.
Sure, and she handed me her glasses,
I loved the feel of the glasses in my hands, and slowly put them on.
I looked around, but could not see very well.
Ashley, you look fantastic wearing glasses, you should be wearing glasses.
I gave Nicole her glasses back and looked at her lenses, they showed a little bit of a ring. 
Wow, they looked nice.

When I went to Nicole s place, I met her mother, she sure looks beautiful.
I loved the looks of her glasses they looked fantastic, I would love wearing glasses like that.
When we were in Nicole s room, I told her how I liked the looks of her mothers glasses, and how nice she looked. 
Then I asked her if she knew anything about induced myopia.
Yes, I have read about it, I think I know how it is done, would you like to give it a try?
I certainly would, but I don t know how.
I think I can help you.
Nicole went to her dresser and handed me a glasses cases
These are my first prescription glasses, if I remember right the prescription of the glasses is– 1.00.      or – 1.25.
I opened the case and looked at a beautiful pair of gold framed glasses.
I put them on and looked around and surprisingly could see reasonably well.
When I looked in the mirror loved what I saw, me wearing prescription glasses.
I loved the feel of the glasses on my face and kept wearing them.
Nicole told me if you wear the glasses as much as possible you might become myopic.
When you can see perfect wearing these glasses, you can try my second pair.
We played some games, and by the time I went home could already see much better when wearing the glasses.
I could not wear the glasses going home, and reluctantly took them off and put them in the case.
I did not want my mother to see me wearing glasses.


I wore the glasses as much as I could, and about a week later when I could see quite good wearing them, started to wear them at school. 
Because there were quite a few students wearing glasses now, wearing glasses is no big deal. 
I did not hear many comments.
About a month later I noticed that without wearing my glasses, I could not see the blackboard clearly anymore.
I mentioned it to Nicole, she smiled and said I think you are getting ready to try my next pair. 
When I put the stronger glasses on, was surprised how well I could see.
Nicole told me the prescription on the glasses is either -2.00 or – 2.25.
The glasses that I wear at present are – 3.25.
I started to wear the stronger glasses and after about a month could see perfect when wearing them, but could not see very well when I took them off, everything at some distance looked fuzzy.
I realized, I now have become myopic, and need to wear glasses full time to see properly, what to do next.

I have a date, Logan a very handsome guy, who is in a class a year ahead of me asked me if I would like to go and see a movie with him, of course I accepted.
When we were seated in the theater, I put my glasses on. 
Ashley I did not know you wore glasses, let me have a good look at you.
You look fantastic wearing glasses, I love the looks of girls who wear glasses.
I was so happy that he liked to see me wearing glasses.

About a week later when I came home from school my mother told me, that a friend of hers had told her, that somebody had seen me wearing glasses at school.
Is that true?
Yes mom, I took my school bag and took out the glasses and put them on.
Well you look very nice wearing glasses, but where did you get them?
I had trouble reading what was on the blackboard, and Nicole loaned them to me.
Well if you need glasses, we better make an appointment for an eye exam, to get you your own prescription.
So an appointment was made.

After the eye exam, the optometrist told me I had quite a high prescription for a first pair of glasses.
My prescription read -2.00 for the right and – 1.75 for the left eye.
When selecting a frame I chose a frame identical to the glasses Nicole is wearing now.
When my glasses were ready and I put them on was so happy, my own prescription glasses.


When Nicole saw me wearing my new glasses, congratulated me on getting my wish for becoming a full time glasses wearer
I told her that I had chosen an identical frame as hers, because after your next exam I would like to wear your present glasses, and I don t think anybody will notice the stronger prescription, when I wear your glasses
Nicole laughed, good thinking, at your next eye exam you will most likely have another good increase in your prescription.
Wearing glasses full time made me feel more confident, because I knew, I looked good wearing glasses.
When Logan saw me wearing my new glasses, came over and told me how good I looked and asked me for another date.

When Logan and I were together he told me that lately, when studying I have been getting headaches.
I asked him if he ever had an eye exam?
You might be a bit farsighted, or have some astigmatism, and wearing glasses might help.
Thank you for the suggestion, I will look into it.
We had a great night out, and going home I was trying to imagine what Logan would look like wearing glasses.


Nicole mentioned to me, that she had another eye exam coming up in a couple of weeks.
You better get ready, I will have another pair of glasses for you to wear.
I looked at her lenses, they looked quite a bit stronger than mine, would my parents notice?
I would have to wait and see.

When I came home, my parents surprised me when they told me, that they had made an appointment for an eye exam next week.

Kim had her eye exam, and again had an increase in her prescription like she expected.
She handed me her old glasses, and I put them on.  
I loved my new look wearing the stronger lenses, would my parents notice?
When wearing the glasses in school it only took me a few days to see reasonably well.
The opportunity to wear them in front of my parents came sooner than I expected.
When I came home from school I had not changed back to my own glasses.
Both my parents were home, wearing their new glasses.
I greeted them and complimented them on their new look.
My mother told me she likes her glasses, she noticed an improvement in her vision, and is very happy with her new look.
Ashley, is it my imagination that your glasses look different?
Mom with the improvement in your vision, you will notice things, you never noticed before.
I guess you are right, I have never before noticed the sparkling look of your lenses, 
and I did not realize it makes your eyes look a little smaller.
Now I can wear Nicole s  -3.25 glasses full time.

Logan came to pick me up for our date.
When I opened the door got a big surprise, he is wearing glasses.
He looked so nice that I walked up to him and gave him a great big kiss.
Logan you look fantastic.
Thank you, you look beautiful to, have you got new glasses, your lenses look stronger?
Yes I had another increase in my prescription.
I love the looks of your new lenses, by the way thank you for suggesting I have an eye exam.
No more headaches, my vision has improved, and I like my new look.
We had a great night.

Nicole wants to become an optician.
When she went to the optical store to talk to the optometrist, and was very surprised when a beautiful glasses wearing lady told her she was the new optometrist.
Nicole and Amy, the optometrist, really liked each other.
After Nicole had told Amy the reason for her visit, Nicole was offered a part time job.

We are almost finished college Nicole and I are still close friends.
My eyeglasses prescription now reads -4.00 for the right , and -3.75 for the left eye, has been the same the last two exams.
I stopped pushing it, because I love the looks of the lenses at that prescription, and I am more fashion conscious now and like to have a choice of frames to wear.
Nicole s prescription is up to – 6.00, and she is happy about that.
After graduation Nicole will be working with Amy the optometrist at the Optical store.
My dad wants me to work in his office.
Logan and I are now engaged and plan to get married after he graduates from university.
We all love wearing our glasses.
