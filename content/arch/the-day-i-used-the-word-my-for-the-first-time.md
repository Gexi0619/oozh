I used the word MY for the first time 

I'm 18 and have just started university. It's very different to being in 6 form.

I have always felt I had perfect vision,and joked about some of the other girls that needed to sit at the front of the class at my old school, but I understood why they would not want to wear the ugly NHS glasses the government provided free,the thought of ever having to wear them sent shivers down my spine.

I'm hoping to soon find time to learn to drive

The problem is that i'm getting very tired with all the studying I'm doing  and many headaches especially above my left eye. If I move my keyboard and sit further away from the computer screen it is easier, but sometimes the pain in my left eye is so bad I have to close it.
Then I need to move my keyboard closer to the screen.

Yesterday I had a SMS message from my mother saying that she had made an eye appointment at my local opticians. She had noticed I was making lots of errors on my text messages.i tried to tell her it was the predicted text and I was too busy to notice the errors,but she would not listen to me.

I nervously opened the door.

I sat down in front of this machine,first my right eye,that was easy,but  then she kept repeating the same test on my left eye.
Next she gave me a paper to take into the eye doctor's room.


The doctor looks long and hard at the paper I gave him.

"Good morning Miss,You can put your glasses back on now, then we can see if your eyes have changed since your last test"

"But I don't wear glasses and I have never had a test before, I can see perfectly I only came because I am getting very bad headaches and my mother insisted I should come"

"How long have you been getting headaches Miss"

"I'm not sure really,it's seems forever but since I started at university it has got so much worse"

He put these big glasses on me and placed a black lens In Front of my left eye .
It was easy to read the first 5 lines with my right eye,then he changed the lens and asked me which is best first or second. Soon I could read line 8 ,I was shocked that the current lens made such a difference I had not realised people could see that far.


Panic set in,Was he going to suggest I wear glasses.


It didn't matter what he said. I was determined that I was never going to be seen wearing glasses,
I could take more headache tablets and be more careful sending mothers texts,why didn't I think of that before and cancel this test.

Next he changed the black lens.
 
"What can you read now Miss "

Was he joking or something? Everything was blurred and a black mess.
When I explained I could not read any of the letters he didn't look surprised

After what seemed hours and many lens changes he turned to me.

"You are a little  short sighted in your right eye and have a large amount of astigmatism, but the main problem is your left eye you are extremely long sighted in that  eye with a very significant amount of astigmatism" 

Then he covered my left eye and gave me a card to hold and read.
I could read most of the lines, as he changed the lens twice and I could read them all.
Next he changed the black lens to my other eye, then told me to read the card with my left eye.What had he done I could not read any of it ,as he added more lenses it all became sharp and clear.

He then removed the black lens and changed all the lenses again.

"Are you suggesting that I need to wear glasses for the computer"

"Well young lady if you want to stop getting headaches then you have no choice but wear glasses from now on"

I was not happy about wearing glasses but at least I could take them off when not studying and nobody needed to know I wore glasses.

"I suggest you keep these test frames on and one of my assistants take you to the coffee shop in the mall to see how you manage with this prescription"


“We can have your glasses ready when you get back,as you are a student the government will provide you with free NHS  glasses I suggest the  pink colour
 will suit you best”

I had heard enough, the words pink NHS glasses was the end of it they would stay in their case in the drawer. Never to be seen by anybody..

I was puzzled, If I could take the glasses off when I was not working on the computer, why did I have to wear these test frames outside?

I was rather embarrassed walking out of the shop wearing these heavy black test frames.but I could see ok but when I looked at the menu it was not very clear,I thought he should have cleaned the lens before telling me to keep them on.

As we walked back to the shop I suddenly realised that my eyes did not feel as tired and my headache had nearly gone.

The lady showed me back into the doctor's office.I was puzzled? there were 2 glasses cases on his desk

My heart sank as he opened the first case.The pink NHS glasses were staring at me. The right lens was not so bad, It was flat at the fron,but the left lens was extremely thick and bulged out in the middle. As he placed them on my face and hooked the cables over my ears they felt very heavy.

Then he told me to read the chart on the wall
 If these were for reading the computer close to me Why could I now read all the letters so clearly on the chart on the other side of the room, it didn't make any sense.

Then he opened the other case.the right lens seemed different to the pair I had on it was no longer flat but a little curved in the middle at the front but the left lens  was even thicker and bulged out even further than this pair and had many lines showing on it .
As he placed them on my face I could no longer read any letter on the wall he the then handed me a card to read everything was so big but also black and clear

He then took them off of me, and put them back in the case and closed both cases.

He handed me the first pair of glasses,my hands were shaking. Did he really expect me to put them back on.
"Can you manage Miss you will soon get used to wearing them and hooking them over your ears after a few days"

As he put both cases into a paper carrier the penny dropped.was he politely telling me I had to wear this pair all the time even outside then change and put the even uglier pair on for reading.

As I looked in the mirror I wanted to cry not only was I wearing a pair of those ugly pink plastic NHS glasses that no attractive girl should be seen wearing  but the thick bulging left lens made my eye look Huge compared to my right eye.
 
“I understand it must be a big Shock finding out that you have such bad eyesight 
but I'm surprised you had not realised before”

I did not want to think about it, the thought of wearing glasses terrified me, 

“If I had come sooner would my left lens not look as ugly as it is now”

“It's impossible to say for certain but you have been straining your left eye for many years,You would definitely have needed glasses but I think they would not have been as powerful as these,so not as thick and heavy”

“You are still a very attractive young lady”

I'm sure I went red, how could he think I still looked attractive, my right eye looked smaller now wearing glasses and my left eye looked huge.

"This is your prescription paper don't loose it"
“I want to check your eyes again in 3 months I have not given you your full prescription today” 

He opened the carrier bag and handed me the reading glasses case.

"I suggest you get used to,putting these on to read, then you won't get the bad headaches "

How could I say I don't want to wear them 
As I opened the case and held them in my hand it  started to shake,
He lent t forward and gentle removed the distance glasses and took the tortoiseshell reading glasses from my hand and  hooked the cables over my ears 
.
The numbers meant nothing to me but I was shocked how large and clear the print looked,I had never been able to read anything that close before,I had alway needed to hold it as far away as possible.

Distance   R -0.75  - 2.75  170
                 L+12.75  + 3.75  175  Prism out 4

Reading  R +3.00   -2.75  170
               L + 14.75  +3.75. 175   Prism out 8

He removed the reading glasses,and handed me the pink distance glasses then indicated for me to put them on.

As I held the glasses  I realised how thick and heavy they were I nervously hooked the cables over my ears I felt faint, I had never worn a pair of glasses before let alone anything as thick and heavy as these, was I condemned to be wearing these from now on

How could I say I don't want to wear them.

"If you sit in the waiting room for 15 mins I will take you home"

"I know it all been a big shock for you, i think it would be a good idea if you put your reading glasses case in your handbag"


I sat there waiting for him I was desperate to take them off, but I could see the receptionist looking at me,as if to say don't  you dare take them off young lady I    kept fiddling with them, why was it if I pulled them down a little a peered over the top of them everything in the distance looked blurry now.

He was very kind and helped me to his car,

It was strange,I hated the weight and the thick left lens but I was amazed how far I could see and everything was so sharp and the colours so bright.

"May we stop and that garage I need to go to the toilet'

I desperately wanted to remove these ugly glasses before anybody saw me wearing them, but he said that he would come into the garage shop with me.

Was that his way of stopping me from removing them.

"You look very pale. Miss have you eaten today, there is a very nice restaurant next to the garage shall we eat there.

I nodded,and tried to say yes please but I was sure everyone must have been staring at me.

"Don't worry it will take you a little time to get used to seeing yourself wearing  glasses, nobody is looking at you,it's just that you can see people in the distance clearer now


How could I ever get used to wearing these ugly things?

The waiter handed me the menu.it was all blurred but I was too nervous to get the reading glasses out with him standing there.
Mark smiled at me and ordered two drinks for us.

He pointed to my hand bag.


I nervously took the case out and opened it,I hated the look of these large tortoiseshell  reading glasses.I remembered a boy at school wearing that colour frame.and everybody calling him names, I used to be a pretty girl now what must I look like.Wearing them.
Mark was smiling at me again.`You look very pretty wearing your glasses .I thought it better to give you a different colour frame so you know which is for distance and which are your reading glasses”.

I do wish he did not say YOUR  glasses, I had always said I would never wear glasses

If he just used the word GLASSES it would be easier to except than YOUR GLASSES 


Mark suggested I keep THE reading glasses on as we had both ordered fish and he thought I would see any bones better.

Had he really said I looked pretty wearing these dreadful reading glasses.

We had a wonderful meal,

"How is your headache, are YOUR glasses helping" 

I suddenly realised I did not have any headaches or pain in my left eye.


““Why have my headaches gone”

“Is that because I am now wearing glasses?

Mark grinned as he nodded in agreement.

I saw Mark looking in the distance.
Sadly With the reading glasses on. I could not see that far.

I could not believe what I said next.

"Can I have  My pink glasses back please I can't see that far with MY reading glasses on Mark"

Mark started to laugh I had used the word MY pink glasses and MY reading glasses for the first time ha 


It was very late as I got back to the student's apartment. We had a lovely time walking around the park, I was disappointed that he did not try to kiss me, had he just been polite when he said I looked pretty wearing glasses,or was I really as ugly as I felt and he wanted to get away as soon as he could.
I quickly ran up the stairs. I wasn't ready to be seen wearing these gastly pink glasses yet ,if ever.

 As I got inside my phone beeped it was a message coming in. Normally I have to enlarge the text to read it. This time my hand dived into my bag. I needed My reading glasses.
What had happened to me I actually wanted to put MY reading glasses on.
Despite them being heavy and ugly and Mark not reminding me to.

It was from Mark thanking me for a lovely evening.and I looked pretty weariNg MY pink glasses as well as My tortoise shell glasses.
And would I like to go out with him for the Day tomorrow? It was his day off,so I would not be his client tomorrow.

Was that the reason he had not kissed me last night

I woke early the next morning and hurriedly got dressed and had a cup of  coffee. I had  better tidy my apartment in case he wants to come in later.it took me about an hour to tidy the main room,why was I getting a headache again and this time some things looked double. 

Then I remembered what Mark had said.
“Put your glasses on as soon as you wake or you will get headaches again”

 I hurried into my bedroom and picked up my pink glasses and hooked the cables over my ears.
I could not believe the difference they made, the double vision cleared  instantly and within 10 minutes my headaches started to go.
Had my eyesight got  worse since yesterday?, I must ask Mark.

It was then that I realised that I was now TOTALLY dependent on wearing glasses for EVERYTHING.

Despite the ugly left lens I now would have  to accept that  I was going to have to wear them from the moment I woke until I went to sleep.

The most embarrassing part will be having to change glasses to read,I know  when people see my thick left lens and how Hugh it makes my eye look,It's obvious that I have extremely bad eyesight but then having to take them off with people staring at me putting my even uglier glasses on to read my phone.

I'm sure people will be saying “That poor girl must be nearly blind”


Even though today is going to be my first full day wearing glasses. Life is already different,even the simple thing  like putting my eye makeup on has become different.
How was I going to manage in the rain?          

The intercom rings ,I tell Mark to wait downstairs

I'm so nervous , I wish I had learnt to smoke, but it's too late now..

What's he going to think and say as I open the door and the first thing he sees is my ugly glasses and my Huge distorted left eye.


“Good morning Louise you look PRETTY, I'm please I choose the pink glasses  frame  for you the colour suits you”

I stuttered “thank you”

He lent forward and gave me a soft gentle kiss on my lips, I realised my thick  left lens was rubbing against his face.He did not seem to mind,was it his way of saying it was ok for me to be wearing these glasses.

“Shall we go and order breakfast first 

We sat outside in the sun, the waitress brought us the breakfast menu,without thinking I instantly got MY reading glasses out of my bag and took my pink glasses off and laid them on the table beside my coffee.not even trying to hide them.
It was so easy reading the menu with MY reading glasses on, I even looked her straight in the face, still wearing them.

“Do you mind Mark if I keep my reading glasses on while we are eating?

We had a wonderful day, Mark never seem to mind how many time I had to change my glasses to read my phone, every time he said I looked pretty,and gave me a kiss

When we were in the museum he then suggested I wear My tortoiseshell . reading glasses all the time while we were looking at all the display cabinets and held my hand as we walked from one display case to another.

I rather liked feeling blind and helpless, because he held my hand all the time.

The rest of the day was wonderful,we chatted and laughed all the time, I even forgot I was wearing glasses until Mark kissed me and I could feel my left lens against his face ,I did wonder if he held me close on purpose so it touched him to prove he not mine my glasses 

I nervously invited him up to my room, we had coffee then some beers
We laid on the Carpet Infront of the fire and started kissing and petting each other. He was so gentle.

He suddenly stopped, I was laying there naked except for my pink glasses,He raised himself up a little and removed MY glasses.
Had he just said I looked pretty wearing  them because it was his job.
We're they in fact such a turn off.
Had he realised how ugly I really looked wearing them.
My heart sank.

Then he opened the reading glasses case that was beside us..
What was he doing, my heart was racing as I felt him placing the thick,heavy  tortoiseshell glasses on my nose and hooking the cables behind my ears

“Will you wear these darling while we make love? I want you to be able to see the pleasure on my face as well as feeling me inside you”

“Did you know you look even prettier wearing these”








it is now 3 months since I got my first pair of glasses I had stated to get a few headaches again


When I told Mark he was not surprised so after work that evening he tested my eyes again


I won't go into too much details , but as soon as he started testing them and changing the lens many times,I  realised what he had meant  3 months ago when he said he was not going to give me the full grade lens I would need


I was now so depended on my glasses that I was not worried about getting stronger lens now,I just wanted to see better like I had when I first got these glasses

“Have my eyes got a lot worse Mark Dear”
“Will my glasses look even uglier than before”

“Well dear there has been some changes  also your eye muscles are more relaxed now so I can give you your full grade lens now”

“I know you are trying to be kind,but what is different now.
 I understand about sph  and astigmation and prisms  ”

“Well the distance prescription for your right eye the sph has changed now, also you need a much greater astigmatism correction and  I have added prisms to that lens this time”

“Ok Mark what's the bad news about my left eye, I know you had to change the lens many times before I could see as well 

Distance  R -4.25. - 4.25  170 prism out  8
                L +18.25  + 4.75 175  Prism out 10

Reading  R+ 4.75 .   -4.25  170 Prism out 12 
              L + 22.25  +4.75  175 Prism out 14 

“It's no good handing me that prescription paper you know I can't read it now even with my reading glasses on.

“Ok dear there is a big change in that eye it has become a lot more long sighted now the astigmation is just a little worse,but I have had to increase the prisms

“Will my lens be a lot thicker and heavier”

“Yes dear I'm sorry but unless we use a smaller frame for your distance lens they will be very heavy to wear all day”

“It will be ok to use the same frames you have now for your reading glasses as you won't have them on for so long”

“Do you mean those small round metal frames that children wear. I don't think I will like them but if you think it's best and don't mind seeing me wearing them then I will try”

I kept the test frames on as we went for coffee while they made up my new glasses , but this time Mark took me.

When we got back there were 3 cases on Mark's desk this time.

My heart sank as Mark opened the first case the lens were very different than before the right lens was much thicker now and protruded from the front of the frame, but words could not fully explain what the left lens looked like, the best I can say was it was like a hard boiled egg cut in half and it bulged out nearly an inch in the middle.

“Why does my left lens look so strange this time Mark”

“It's what's called a lenticular lens dear,all the power is just in the middle of the lens so it's much lighter dear”

As Mark hooked the cables of the small black metal frames over my ears my eyes seemed to be pulling outwards from my nose, the only good thing was my vision was crystal clear,and they were much lighter.
I didn't want to look in the mirror yet 


Mark suggested I try the reading glasses on next .

 I was in total shock. I was not expecting the lens to look as bad as this..
Even the right lens bulged out in the middle this time, but the left lens was larger and much thicker all over than I had expected. When Mark placed them on my nose I understood why he said I couldn't wear them all day. The large tortoiseshell. plastic frames  and the thick heavy left lens seemed to tip the glasses sideways on my face. Mark explained that the strap at the back would stop them slipping down

“Can I look at my prescription now please Mark.

Distance  R + 4.25  - 4.25  170 prism out  8
                L +18.25  + 4.75 175  Prism out 10

Reading  R +8.25.   -4.25  170 Prism out 12 
              L + 22.25  +4.75  175 Prism out 14 

I then realised why my lens were so ugly the large amount of prism that were add made them much thicker 

“What is the 3rd case for Mark why do I need 3 pairs”

“Open it and you will find out”

“Why has it got your name on it? I never knew you needed glasses.. And why are they so thick?

“Well I have been getting a few headaches so I thought it time to start wearing glasses”

“But they are very thick. Have you not had problems before”

“Well I knew you would be upset about your new glasses so I got the technician to use large blanks  and make mine as thick as possible”

“O Mark, that is so sweet of you and they are small round metal frames just like mine. 
“Can I put them on for you please”

My hands were shaking with excitement  as I placed them on his nose and hooked them behind his ears
 
“How have they made them so thick? Mark . 

He just smiled and undid the strap at the back of my head and took my reading glasses off 

I hurriedly put my new small black glasses back on and pulled Mark towards the mirror. As we looked at each other 
I heard him whisper in my ear “You look beautiful and sexy with your new glasses on” 

3 months ago I dreaded the thought of even wearing glasses.
Now suddenly I felt happy and felt sexy wearing these small black metal frames glasses with the thick left lens bulging out at the front of the frame.

I could not stop myself. I pulled his trouser down and grabbed hold of him and thrust him deep inside me. I screamed with delight as I felt my legs getting warm and sticky.
