description: A man's perception of his brother's plain wife changes drastically after a tragic accident reveals her hidden beauty.
---
It had been about 5 years since my older brother Ron had married Sue and I didn't like her any better at this point than I had before he married her. There was really nothing wrong with Sue as a person, but I found her especially unattractive.  She couldn't be called ugly, but she certainly could be described as plain looking and the plainness made her appear frumpy, or as some people call it, dowdy.  Her eyes appeared to be kind of weird, as they were fairly small, and had an outward bulge to them and they always appeared to be partially closed. Her hair was a mousy brown, and she wore it parted in the middle and it usually hung limply around her face down to her shoulders.  She never wore any makeup, nor tried to make herself look more attractive by wearing bold, colorful clothing.  She had a very nice body, with a decent chest size, a nice trim waist and a great rear end. Her legs were also very shapely, but she just didn't attract me.  Ron was a good looking guy, and I just could not see what he had found attractive in this plain jane lady.  But Sue was his wife, so I did my best to be pleasant towards her,  and even though I am sure I she could sense my disdain towards her she seemed friendly enough towards me.

The call came late one evening. Ron had run his Harley broadside into a car that had made a left turn right in front of him.  It wasn't his fault, but when you are riding a motorcycle and some driver cuts you off like that you don't have much of a chance. I knew Ron would have had his helmet and all his safety equipment on, because he was far more conscientious when riding than I was, but even so it did not surprise me when mother told me he was in intensive care, and the prognosis wasn't good. I dressed and headed for Ron's place to pick Sue up and get to the hospital.

Sue was waiting for me, and as I pulled into their driveway she came running for the passenger side of the car. She opened the door and slid in, almost before I could bring the car to a full stop.  I noticed that Sue was wearing glasses, but I had not been able to get a good look at them.  I was focused on getting to the hospital and I was unable to do anything more than take a quick glance or two over her way, but her hair hid her face and I could not get a good look at her to see what she looked like with her glasses on.

I dropped Sue at the front entrance and went to park the car.  When I got back to the foyer she was nowhere to be seen, so I assumed that Sue had found out where Ron was and had gone to be by his side.  I asked the lady at the desk where Ron would be, and she told me that he was in intensive care and that I should head up to the third floor.  I followed her directions and rode up the elevator.  Mother was already there in the waiting room, and I asked her if Sue had found her way up. She told me that Sue was now in the room with Ron, but no one else was allowed in.  So I sat with mother in the waiting room.  Mother had been in with Ron until Sue got there and she was crying silently, so I assumed that things didn't look too good for Ron.  There were all sorts of people in hospital uniforms going in and out of the intensive care room that Ron was in.

Sue came out about half an hour later.  She walked through the door without me noticing her, but when she came over to us she spoke our names and I looked up at her.  She told us that Ron was clinically dead, but they had him on life support until they could harvest his organs.  Our whole family had signed organ donor cards years ago when dad passed away because he couldn't get a liver transplant.

As Sue was telling us that I looked at her, and I almost gasped when I saw her glasses.  There were 2 little circles, one in front of each eye, and her already tiny eyes looked to be even smaller behind the lenses.  But what was amazing was that with her glasses on her face this previously plain and mousy woman was now looking amazingly attractive to me.  I had never before thought that I was attracted to ladies who wore glasses, but whatever transformation her powerful glasses caused in Sue, I was now amazed at how attractive she looked.

We were all allowed to go in and say our goodbyes to Ron, and we each sat with him and held his hand for a few minutes.  Sue had a lot of papers to sign, and mother didn't want to leave until they pulled the plug, so I was going to stay as well.  Finally the paperwork was done and we stayed with Ron until he stopped breathing.  Mother left to go on home and I drove Sue home.

“Your glasses were a well kept secret Sue.  This is the only time I have seen you wearing them.  You look very nice in them.” I said.

“I hardly ever wear them out in public. The only reason I had them on tonight is that I need to take my contact lenses out as soon as I get home from work and I need to leave them out for at least 10 hours a day. I didn't put them back in because I didn't know when you would get here, and anyway my eyes were too sore to even think of putting them back in.” Sue replied.

“Well, if your eyes are sore why don't you just wear your glasses more?' I asked.

“I am seriously blind without my glasses, and I can see a lot better with contacts than I can with glasses, so I would rather wear contacts.” Sue replied.

“How blind is seriously blind?” I asked.

“I am so nearsighted they don't even have numbers for anyone with eyes as bad as mine.  Even with my glasses on the best I can see on the chart is around 20/70.  I can do a little better with my contacts as I can get to 20/30 for one eye and 20/40 for the other.  It probably won't mean anything to you, but my glasses prescription is -37.50 for my right eye and -37.00 for my left.  And that my dear former brother in law is a pretty darned serious prescription.” Sue said.

That was the end of our conversation about her eyesight.  I parked in her driveway and walked her to her door, mostly because I wanted to have a final look at her wearing her glasses.  I had noticed something funny about them back at the hospital, but once I got a better look I was able to tell that there were 2 circles in each lens. The front of each of the lenses had a circle that was dished in, and the front circle was slightly larger than the rear circle, which was also dished in so that the thinnest point of the circles were in the very center. The lenses themselves didn't look very thick, but there were tons of rings that appeared in the lens around the circles, giving her tiny eyes the appearance of them being the bulls-eye in a target.

I drove home and went back to bed, but soon found that I needed to call on the assistance of Rosy Palm and the 5 helpers. If anyone had told me that morning that I would be having sexual feelings towards my frumpy sister in law I would have called them crazy, but that was exactly what was happening.

Mom and Sue and I spent a lot of time together the next few days.  First came the planning of the funeral, and then we had the viewing the evening before the funeral. Then the day of the funeral stared with another viewing before the service. Finally it was over and Ron was on his way to the crematorium.  Of course Sue had worn her contact lenses all three days, but even so I now looked at her with a new light, and I couldn't understand why I had found her so unattractive, Now she looked beautiful to me.

Soon after the funeral I parted ways with Julie, my girlfriend of over a year.  I still found her attractive, but I just couldn't bring myself to carry on with her when I wanted to be with someone else.  I didn't even know if Sue would want to go out with me, but I felt that as long as I was not going with anyone it would help a lot.  I started slowly, by calling Sue at least once a week just to see if she was all right, and if I could help out in any way.  After a month of doing this I asked her if she would like to have lunch with me on Saturday, and she agreed.

“You know Dan, I always felt that you didn't like me very much, but since Ron died you have been very supportive, so I guess my feelings were wrong.” Sue said.

“It wasn't that I didn't like you Sue. You were my brother's wife, so as far as I was concerned it was inappropriate for me to attempt to get too close to you.  If you hadn't been married to Ron I certainly would have asked you out.” I lied.

“Oh, that explains it then. I just had the feeling that you wanted nothing to do with me.” Sue said.

“Just out of curiosity did Ron know that you had very poor eyesight before you two got married?” I asked.

“I expect he did, because both Ron and I worked for the fire department.  I was having a lot of trouble with my contacts for a year before we married, so whenever I was having problems with my contacts I was wearing my glasses to work once in a while. So I am sure he had seen me wearing my glasses before we started dating.  Why do you ask?” Sue asked.

“Oh, I was just curious.  You know, you have a completely different appearance when you are wearing glasses.” I said.

“Better, or worse?' Sue asked.

“Oh I can't really say one way or the other. You look good wearing contacts, and you look good wearing glasses.  It is just that when you are wearing your glasses you look a little more special.” I replied.

I guess I didn't put my foot in my mouth too badly that day, because when I called her up during the week and suggested that she might like to go to a dance with me the next weekend she accepted.  Before too long we were dating on a regular basis, and after about 6 months of this I asked Sue to marry me. She accepted, and we set a wedding date in another 6 months.

I was not prepared for my mother's reaction.

“You are marrying her?  Why would you do that?” Mom asked.

“I really like her a lot mom.  I thought you did too.” I said.

“I had to when your brother was married to her.  But I would rather not have you marry her as well.” Mom replied.

“You had better get used to it mom, because we are getting married next spring. What do you not like about Sue?” I asked.

“You have seen those thick glasses she has to wear. She is blind as a bat, and I don't want my grandchildren to have such bad eyesight.” Mom said.

“Her glasses aren't a problem to me. And if we have kids and they have bad eyes we will just cross that bridge when we come to it.  I have good eyesight so the chances are 50 50 that our kids will have good eyes.” I said.

“I know you will do what you want Dan. I just had to tell you how I felt.” Mom said.

So, with my moms reluctant blessing the wedding plans went ahead. When the day came my bride looked very nice, far more attractive than I had ever thought she could look when wearing her contacts.  After the wedding we returned to my house for the night, and then the next day we were heading out for a 2 week honeymoon.  I was hoping beyond hope that I could convince my new bride to wear her glasses for me as much as possible during our honeymoon, but I wasn't going to be too disappointed as long as she wore them when we went to bed.

“Honey, you will probably be napping in the car while I drive. Why don't you just wear your glasses?” I asked.

“That might be easier – as long as you don't mind.” Sue replied.

“No, I don't mind.  You look fabulous when you are wearing your glasses.” I said.

So for that first day her glasses stayed in front of her beautiful weak eyes.  Every once in a while she would have to ask me to read her what a sign said, and I would read it to her, but for the most part everything went well.  I loved it when we stopped for lunch and she sat across the table from me where I could gaze through the center of those powerful lenses into her tiny, very nearsighted eyes.  That night we stopped at our motel.

“I'll just put my lenses in for supper darling.” Sue said.

“Oh, don't bother with that honey. We won't be in the restaurant long enough for you to go to the trouble.” I replied.

“Well, all right, as long as you don't mind.” Sue told me.

That night our lovemaking was long and tender.  Sue wanted her glasses off at first, so I carefully folded the arms and placed them on the nightstand.

“You know, I can't even see your face without my glasses. Would you mind if I put them back on?” Sue asked.

“Let me put them on for you.” I replied.

After we made love Sue feel asleep in my arms with her glasses still on her nose.   I wanted to leave them there, but I was afraid they would get bent, or even worse, broken, so I gently removed them and placed them back on the nightstand.

“My glasses Danny – where did you put my glasses?” Sue asked in the morning.

“Right here honey.  I'll get them for you.” I replied.

"I'm going to put my contacts in today.” Sue said.

“Don't do it for me.  We will be doing a lot more driving today, and your eyes might dry out and be sore with the air conditioning on.” I replied.

“Are you sure you don't mind?” Sue asked.

So for the next day she wore glasses again. We did stop at a few tourist attractions and Sue complained once or twice that she should have put her contacts in so that she could see things better, but there was no place for her to properly do that so she didn't. Then when we were at the beach the next few days I suggested that she might be better off wearing her glasses in case sand got in her eyes.  By the time we got back home Sue had worn her glasses for about 11 out of the 14 days of our honeymoon. I was pleased as punch with myself.

After our honeymoon we both had to go back to work, and Sue went back to her contact lens routine. I still saw her in her glasses every night around the house, so that was all that mattered. But, like the schemer I am, I had a plan to try to get her to quit wearing her  contacts completely. By now I had found out that there were some brands of contact lens solution that Sue could not use because some of the ingredients in them caused her eyes to become sore and red. So, I started to substitute the brands that were the problem with her good solution by pouring out some of the good stuff, and replacing it with the bad stuff.  Sure enough, now her eyes were sore and red almost every day.  She tried different brands of solution, but the end results were all the same, so this meant a trip to her eye doctor.  He carefully examined her red and sore eyes and then recommended that she quit wearing her contacts before she damaged her cornea's.  She did so reluctantly, and now I could gaze at my very nearsighted beauty wearing glasses anytime I wanted to.

Her eye doctor had discovered that Sue had become slightly more nearsighted since her last exam. She also hadn't changed her glasses after her last small increase, and  that was why her glasses didn't give her nearly as good a correction as her contacts did. Since she was going to be wearing glasses all the time now we decided to buy her a new pair of glasses with the best possible lenses.  As a result the glasses we ended up buying for Sue were extremely expensive, but when I saw them on her face I knew that the money was well spent.  Her new lenses in her now -39.00D and -38.50D prescription were 1.9 high index glass and were again double myodiscs. But the rear bowl, which has to be the smaller of the two bowls according to the optician, was slightly larger than the rear bowl was in her old glasses. The old glasses had an 18mm rear bowl, while the new ones were 24mm, and the extra few millimeters made a big improvement in the amount of peripheral vision Sue had. But the best part was that the new glasses gave her an improvement in her visual acuity, and now she had around 20/50 in both eyes with them on.  This wasn't enough to allow her to drive, but at least she could see a lot better with her new glasses on than she could with her old ones, and this made her feel better about wearing glasses instead of contacts.

We have been trying to have children for the past couple of years as well, but Sue has not gotten pregnant yet.  She still goes to her job as an asset manager and procurement agent at the fire department every day.  Ron was 30 when he was killed and Sue was 26. Now after 3 years of us being married Sue is turning 30, so we still have another year or 2 before we go to the doctor to see what is preventing her getting pregnant. It sure hasn't been from lack of trying. 

I can't ask my brother if he was as turned on by Sue wearing her glasses as I am. I can only guess that he was.  And sometimes I wonder if my brother had lived would he ever have resorted to the same sort of subterfuge as I did to get Sue to wear glasses instead of contacts, or would he have been satisfied to leave well enough alone and just have her wear her glasses in the evenings when they were by themselves?
