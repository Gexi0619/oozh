description: "Discover how contact lenses transformed my life and the surprising journey of my changing prescription."
---
My life completely changed for the better when I finally got contact lenses. I had been suffering from my myopia all throughout middle school so it was a huge relief at the end of 8th grade when I got contacts with a prescription of -2.00 in my right eye and -1.75 in my left. I got a pair of glasses too but as I mentioned before I really didn’t want them so I never ever wore them, unless I was at home watching tv and my sister had taken the seat closest to the tv. 

During the summer before high school, I didn’t really wear my contacts much around the house. As awesome as it was to be able to see clearly, my vision was not bad enough to warrant the use of lenses at home, unless I was watching tv. In those cases I would either sit close to the tv or run upstairs and grab my glasses. That summer, I had a job at my local ice cream parlor, scooping cones. Every morning I would wake up, and head downstairs for breakfast, and eat with my family. Afterwards I would head upstairs get into my uniform and then head to the bathroom to put in my contacts. Then my parents would take me to work. 

The rest of the summer was very routine. Work, home, and spend time with friends, that’s all I did. Soon it was September and school was starting up again. I was excited to be able to see the board again with my new contact lenses. The year began and classes were going well, but soon into October I started noticing that my distance vision was not as sharp as it had been when I first got contacts at the end of the last year. I mentioned this to my mom who asked me how many lenses I had left before I needed to reorder. The answer was about a month so she asked my if I could wait until November to get an eye exam and a new supply of daily contact lenses. I agreed and before I knew it November came around it was time for my second eye exam. 

At the exam they eye doctor had me read the eye chart with my contacts in, and I was able to read about 4 lines down before it got hard. Then he walked me to take my contacts out and try again. The chart instantly descended into a blur. The doctor then put the exam glasses over my eyes and inserted a bunch of lenses until it was clear again for me. In the end my prescription had increased by -0.75 in my right eye and -0.50 in my left. That brought my prescription up to -2.75 in my right and -2.25 in my left. At that point I thought that was a pretty large increase. Boy would I be in for a surprise in the future. My mom asked the doctor whether I needed to get new glasses as well as a new contacts prescription. The doctor then asked me how often I wore them, to which I responded rarely. He said that if that was the case, it wouldn’t be a problem if I didn’t upgrade my glasses this time since I rarely wore them and the prescription change was not too large. 

My vision with the new contacts was awesome! I was able to see things clearly again in the distance. It was great. The eye doctor had recommended I only order a 6 month supply of lenses this time because I was at the age where eyes change rapidly and if I had this much of an increase after just 6 months I was likely to have another increase in the next 6 months. So thats what we did, i got another supply of contacts and wore them every day. 

By the end of the school year as i neared the end of my supply my eyes had gotten worse. After my eye exam I ordered a new supply of contacts with my new prescription of -3.50 in my right and -3.25 in my left. At this point my eyesight without contacts, while not unbearable, was pretty bad. I would still eat breakfast without them because I was too tired in the morning to put them in first. I hadn’t gotten new glasses either because my mom forgot to ask about them and I made every effort to not bring it up. It was the summer between my freshman and sophomore years and during that time I went through a massive growth spurt. Of course that caused my eyesight to get worse too. By the end of the summer I needed contacts with a prescription of -4.25 in both eyes in order to see clearly. I managed to again avoid getting glasses. 

At this point my eyesight was intolerable without correction. My morning schedule had to change. Everyday I would make up and immediately go to the bathroom to put in my contacts. I would then go about my day. The middle of sophomore year was really exciting! Around the middle of the year I turned 16 which meant i could get my learners permit. When i went to the RMV to get it I took the vision test and for once succeeded at something visually. I passed the test (with my contacts) and was able to get my permit, albeit with a Vision Correction restriction. 

The rest of high school was pretty normal. I started dating some girls. I never told them about about my bad eyesight which was -5.50 in my right and -5.00 in my left by the beginning of my senior year. The only girl that ever know how blind I was was my second girlfriend, Mia. My parents and sister were away for the weekend so I invited Mia to stay over. We had already slept together a couple of times so that weekend was not going to be anything special in that sense. I mean we defiantly planned on doing it, but it was nice to be able to spend the quality time together without our parents around.

That Friday night, I taken as shower right before bed had taken out my contacts. I then went to my bed and scrolled through instagram while Mia was in the shower. I could still see well enough without my glasses to see my phone screen if I held it close enough to my face. When Mia got out of the shower she opened the door to the bathroom and stood in the door frame for a couple of seconds. I looked over at her and then looked back at my phone. After a few more seconds she said: “Timmy?” “Yes?” 

Now in the past, when I saw Mia naked my penis immediately got hard which made it clear to Mia that I was ready for what was about to happen. But this time nothing happed, and Mia was concerned:

“Ummm? Timmy?” 
I squinted
“Why are you squinting, can’t you see me?”
“Um, well... No actually. You see I usually wear contacts and my prescription is pretty strong”
“Okay so put on your glasses.”
“I don’t have any. Come closer.”

And the closer she came the more detail I saw and the more I realized where we were going. Before I knew it Mia was on top of me and we were kissing and I was playing with her boobs and she was playing with my penis. As things became more heated, I blindly reached into bedside table’s drawer, trying to feel my way to the box of condoms I had prepared in anticipation for the sex we were going to have that weekend. After I few moments, the condom was on and Mia and I had the best sex we had ever had so far. I don’t know if it was because I was blind or the fact that we had the house to ourselves but we both agreed it was the best sex we had ever had.
