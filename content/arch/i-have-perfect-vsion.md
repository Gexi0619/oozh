My vision is perfect




A whole new life style for me.
My dad bought a nice house and some acreage, in the country.
What a change, now I see the large sky, and have an unlimited view. 
I love looking at all the farms in the distance, the wood lots and animals both domesticated, and even some in the wild
When I go to High school, the bus picks me up, at the end of our driveway.
Slowly, I am getting used to the new life style, and I like it.
While riding on the bus, you get to know everybody, and have a great time.




To day going to school, I was sitting next to Audrey, a very pleasant glasses wearing girl.
She was easy to talk to, and while we were talking I looked at her glasses.
She looks nice wearing glasses, but what surprised me, that when looking at her, I noticed that the lenses of her glasses
made her forehead look more narrow, and looking through the edge of the lens, everything looked smaller and further away.
Poor girl, must be blind, I am glad, I have perfect vision. 
There are 4 girls on the bus, who wear glasses, and they all look very nice, and I am sure, I will get to know all of them.


Why, do I like the looks of glasses on a person?
I can’t figure it out, I don’t want to wear glasses, and my vision is perfect. 
What I like, is the looks of eyes behind the lenses, I think it makes the eyes look nicer.
A few of the boys are wearing glasses, and look very handsome.
I have noticed that sometimes, the lenses on some of the glasses, make the eyes look larger.
I wonder why?
I will have to get more informed, about eyes and glasses, so I know what I am looking at.




It did not take long, for me to get to know, Jim, a very handsome farm boy, with big brown eyes.
I did not refuse, when he asked me for a date.
Jim and I get along well, and are making plans, for after graduating, when Jim is taking a horticultural course. 


After graduating, I have moved to another town, and soon found a nice apartment on the edge of town, 
In the apartment, is a nicelarge window. 
When looking out of the window, you can see some fields, and lots of trees, and you can even see,
a church steeple, way in the distance, I love the view, it is like living in the country.




Jim, is going to move in with me, while he is going to college.
I am working at a large insurance office, so we have some money coming in.
It also is a way, to find out that we will get along.


We are all settled now, Jim goes to college, I go to work.
I like my work, I am now working in a large office, with many other people.
During coffee and lunch breaks, I quite often, end up sitting with a person, who I have seen, but don’t know,
which gives me the opportunity, to get to know them.
I have talked with most of the girls, and I still I don’t know why, but I seem to prefer talking, with people who wear glasses.
I love it when glasses, are part of conversations,.
With all he conversations I have had with glasses wearing people, I have never tried wearing anybody’s glasses.
I have no idea what you see, or how it feels to wear glasses.


At our night time meal, when Jim and I discus the news for the day, the topic, quite often is, about somebody,
who came to work wearing glasses, and how nice or handsome they look.
Jim, has no problem about talking about glasses, usually about a student wearing glasses, he had not noticed before.




I love the looks of glasses wearing women, and give all of them a good look. 
I can’t wait for the day, that Jenny is going to start wearing glasses.
Telling her, that I like to see her wearing glasses, would be a mistake, I know she does not want to wear glasses.
I am quite sure, that if I am patient, the day will come, that she finds out, that her vision is not perfect.




Because we get along just fine, we decided to get married, and Jim, has now graduated and has a nice job.
He works for a seed company, where he does field work, and is involved in sales.
I have met a couple of the girls, at his work, that he has talked about, and who are now wearing glasses.
Knowing that Jim likes the looks of girls who wear glasses, he also knows, that my vision is perfect, 
and I don’t need to wear glasses, and I have no intention of wearing glasses.




Jenny, lately has complained that she has a headache, and mentioned to me that, lately there seems to be more fog, 
in the distance, and cannot see the church tower anymore.
I agreed, I did not want to tell her, that I was sure her vision is not perfect anymore, I know she will find out,




To day I received a notice, to renew my drivers license.
I decided that I would go, for an eye exam, because I wanted to make sure, I pass the vision test. 
I had my last eye exam, about six years ago.
When I mentioned to Jenny, I was going to have an eye exam, she thought I was crazy,
Jim, I know, your eyesight is perfect, the same as mine.
I made an appointment for a Saturday morning, that way I was sure, that Jenny would go with me.
I was hoping, that she might look, and perhaps, try some frames, then she would know, and I could see, 
what she would look like wearing glasses,.




I was fascinated with all the new equipment, that is now in use to examine eyes.
At the end of the exam, the optometrist surprise me, when she told me I needed to wear glasses.
I have some astigmatism, and I am hyperopic.
She handed me the prescription, to take to the optician, what a surprise ,my vision is not perfect anymore.




When I came out of the examination room, Jenny was reading a magazine.
She put the magazine down, and said, let’s go and get our shopping done.
Sorry Jenny, I have to find a good looking frame, because I have to wear glasses,
I don’t believe it.
Well here is the prescription.




After we had started to look and try different frames,,Jenny was getting excited, about me having to wear glasses,
At last we found a frame, she thought would look great, and make me look very handsome.
After the optician had taken all the measurements, told me my glasses would be ready, in the early afternoon.




We went to the mall, and had some lunch, and yes, I was excited about getting glasses, but I am sure,
that Jenny is more excited, about me wearing glasses, then I am, because she keeps talking about them.
Jim, I am so surprised that you are prescribed to wear glasses, but I am sure I will love your new look.
The frame we selected, will make you look more handsome. I can’t wait to see your glasses wearing look.






My glasses were ready, and after having them fitted, I looked around.
Jenny, loved my look, and is all excited.
I noticed an improvement in my close up vision, and enjoy wearing the glasses, my new look, seems to make me feel, 
more confident, and I have received many compliments.




About six month later, Jenny wondered why everything far away, seems to look so foggy lately,
I cannot see the church steeple anymore, the trees are all gone, what happened?
I agreed and told her, I had noticed,.
What I had noticed, was that Jenny does more squinting, and I am sure, she has a problem with her distance vision.
I know now, I guess the best thing to do is, don’t say anything, just agree, and I am sure she will need to be wear glasses,
and that she will not have perfect vision anymore.




A few weeks later, Jenny told me about Amy, a girl she works with, came in to work today, wearing glasses.
Jim, I never saw a woman wearing glasses, who looked so perfect.
She his wearing a very nice coloured frame, which blends in perfect with the colour of her hair.
Amy, looks stunning, wearing glasses.
After I had mentioned to her, how nice she looked wearing the glasses, told me that she had flunked the vision test,
for her drivers license.
I love my new glasses, and how I look, and the glasses are so comfortable, and I love my improved vision.
Did you get to try the glasses?
No, I did not, I have never tried a persons glasses, and don’t want to ruin my perfect vision.




On a Friday, afternoon, Jenny called Jim, and told him, she had to finish an assignment for her boss, 
so he would have it on his desk, for an early Monday meeting, and that she will be later coming home.




I finished the assignment, and placed it on my managers desk, then went to the bathroom, when I was seated,
noticed, what looked like a glasses case, in the next stall.
After finishing, I got up and picked up the case.
Then I washed my hands, and checked my hair and make up. 
Looking at the glasses case, wondered if there were glasses in it.
I opened the case, and looked at a beautiful pair of glasses.
I could not resist, to take the glasses out of the case, and have a good look at them.
I loved the feel of the glasses in my hand, and now wondered, how I would look wearing glasses.
Now was the time to find out.
I put the glasses on, and sure liked the way, they felt on my face.
What a shock, I got when I looked through the lenses, everything I looked at was now, so nice and clear.
I could not believe, how good I looked wearing the glasses, and how well I could now see wearing the glasses.
Never in my life did I feel so excited, I would never have believed, that wearing glasses,
could improve both your looks and vision that much, and be so comfortable to wear.
I told the cleaning staff, that I was leaving, and went home.
Wearing the glasses, driving home was a pleasure, I could read all the road signs, and no halo’s on car lights.




When, Jim saw me coming in to the apartment, wearing glasses, was stunned.
Why did you not tell me, you were getting glasses?
So I told Jim my story, and suggested, that we make an appointment for an eye exam for me, so I can get my own glasses.
Now I know, that when I get my own glasses, my vision will be perfect again.
