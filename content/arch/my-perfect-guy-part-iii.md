description: A woman's attraction to her boyfriend's vulnerability without glasses leads to an unexpected breakup.

I don't want to disappoint you but this part doesn't have sexual content. However next one will. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTS!

Let me know if you like it please.




Mike and I have been dating for 9 months now, and feeling him so vulnerable when he is without his glasses makes me feel like he needs me and it turns me on like nothing else does.

I’ve noticed he’s been uncomfortable with his contacts lately because if we stay home, he rushes to the bathroom to take them off, but I try to pretend I don’t even notice his vision issues because I know he is insecure about that and I really love him!

_______________________________________________________________________________




Yesterday Mike booked an appointment with his ophthalmologist for today and he asked me to drive him, so we’re on our way!


“Mike, you know you should have come sooner, right?” Said Dr. Jaff

“I know, but I just had so much going on at work” Mike replied 

“This is serious Michael, we’ve talked about this before and I really think is time for you to stop wearing contact lenses. They don’t work for you anymore, your eyes are sore and you can’t even see as good as you could” 

I realize Mike has a hard time understanding this, he has his glasses on his lap, and he is trying to pretend he actually sees something but he can’t fool me no more, I see his eyes turning in a little bit and I guess he puts no effort on squinting because it doesn’t work for him,

“I think you should consider maybe getting new glasses, that way you’ll have a spare pair and you’ll get used to wearing them at all times”

“Ok Doc” Said Mike, “If that is what I have to do, then let’s make them… I’m not so sure this is gonna be easy, but at least I’ll try”

So now we have to go to the opticians store to get my boy a pair of specs.

I never thought a trip to the optician would be so exiting!!! I get to choose Mikes frames because he can’t even see his face!

“Honey, I’ve been wondering what is like to be you” I said

“What do you mean babe? Like being a man?” Said Mike

“Nope, like having to go trough what you go thought every day when you wake up and you can’t see”

“Well, there’s not much to wonder… I feel a bit useless to be honest. I can’t drive without contacts, I can’t box, I can’t swim…” Replied mike

“You’re not useless, we have public transportation, and you could absolutely swim if you had prescription googles. But that’s not my point Mike, I need to confess that I find your glasses/eyesight situation very appealing. I don’t want you taking this the wrong way, I’m just trying to let you know how I feel” I said

“Oh, I never thought you’d find glasses interesting… I mean, maybe if you wear my glasses you’ll see what I see without them” Said Mike

“No honey, I have been navigating through some websites and I found a very particular one, it’s called eye scene. I found A LOT of information and I find it so interesting. The people writing there have become experts, they even have a little chart you can use to order contact lenses and wear them while wearing glasses” I said

“I’m not understanding Niks… Do people actually find being half blind interesting, or are we for you guys to tease?” Said Mike with a tone of anger, as if I was mocking him

“No, It isn’t like that Mike. I like you, and I like your glasses because of that. But you have never had good vision and I thought I might as well get a little glimpse of what you have to go through to be able to understand you better, that’s all… I never thought you’d be so angry about this.” I replied being upset at his response 

“Well I am Nicole, and I don’t want to be your personal clown anymore. I want to break up and I want you to respect that” Mike said without hesitation 

WHAT?! I AM HEARING RIGHT?! IS HE BREAKING UP WITH ME?!!!

“You can’t be serious Mike, we have an amazing relationship, we have amazing sex… Tell me you are joking” I said holding my tears back 

“No Niks, I really want you to understand this and stop asking questions. If you don’t mind you can pull over here, my apartment is close enough for me to walk there by myself” Said Mike

“I don’t know what to say Mike, please don’t do this. I love you, I don’t want you thinking I see you as my personal showman or as a stunt… I just love every part of you, even the part you hate the most, please don’t do this Mike”. I said sobbing 

“Pull over Niks, please respect my decision and don’t try to call, I want it this way” Said Mike firmly 

I don’t understand what’s going on, I just see him grabbing his sweater and walking far from me… What do I do now?!



_______________________________________________________________________________





I’ve spent the last three months away from Mike,  and as he asked, I haven’t call him. He behaved like an asshole, I really gave him my all… I miss him so much that I bought a cologne like the one he wears and as pathetic as this sound I spray it on the sweatshirt he left in my apartment  and I wear it to sleep every night.

I have tried every method people suggests on eye scene to “ruin” my perfect eyesight and it’s not working. I really want to wear glasses now, but for some reason GOC don’t fit me… Knowing I can take out the contact and having perfect vision whenever I want, kind of ruins the whole point to me, so I’m going to Mexico City with an Ophthalmologist that said could make my wish come true.

I’m feeling a little bit nervous, I’m not gonna lie, but I feel so incomplete right now and just thinking I’ll have my glasses with me all the time makes me feel better.

“Nicole Way?” Said the receptionist as I came closer to her desk “Please follow me ms. Way. This is Dr. Randolphs office, he’ll be right with you.”

I’m trying to think of one good reason I shouldn’t do this, but I just keep making excuses for each good reason I come up with. 

“Hey, there you are! I finally get to meet you Nicole, how are you? Was your flight ok?” Said a short, white haired, fair skinned, kinda gepetto looking man

“Dr. Randolph is so good finally meeting you. Everything was good, thank you so much for asking. I’m a little nervous, but very exited” I replied

“Ok Nicole, first we’ll go through some things alright? If you have any doubt please let me know.” Said Dr. Gepetto “I need to understand a little bit more, why do you wanna do this to yourself? Are you conscious that this might have consequences that can be a lot more than just removing your implants?”

“Yes Doc, I’m aware of it. And I could have a ton of reasons to do this, but be honest with me, would they mind? Would your opinion of me change if you understood my reasons? I said 

“You have a good point there Nicole, it wouldn’t. But I just wanna ask one more time. Are you aware and sure you want to do this procedure? From your emails I understand you want to see like a -25 myopic person sees, am I right?” Said Dr. Randolph

“Absolutely” I replied

“Ok, Nicole I want you to understand this isn’t very ethical, I shouldn’t be doing this procedure but I spoke to my wife who wears glasses for hyperopia and she talked me into this, she said she is happy with her glasses and perhaps you’ll be happier when you have yours.” Said Dr Randolph, and all I could do was nod my head and smile like I haven’t in months! “We’re doing the artificial lens implants.This surgery involves replacing the natural lens that’s found inside the eye with an implant containing a multifocal lens – this is also known as a refractive lens exchange. It is similar to the surgery that’s carried out for cataracts and is performed using a local anaesthetic. This means you can go rest as soon as the procedure has been carried out. I wouldn’t recommend flying at least this week.” added Dr Randolph

“I understand, and your wife is right, you have no idea how happy I feel” I said smiling

“Ok Nicole, then I’ll have Dr. Laura tuning a few tests on you and I’ll see you tomorrow. I’m happy you are happy” Replied Dr Randolph as a young optician came in and took me to another room.

TODAY IS MY BIG DAY!

To be honest I am a bit nervous, what if it goes wrong? What if Dr. Randolph pulls out? What if this wrecks my life? all those thoughts run through my head but I just keep walking towards his clinic very early in the morning. 

As I get to the clinic the receptionist asks me to fill out some forms, I do an she gives me a gown, a paper head cap, and a pair of flip flops. 

Dr. Randolph comes in and tells me I’m gonna be ok, grabs my hand and kisses my cheek (I’ve noticed everyone does in Mexico so is not a big deal), and there I go!

I saw a few videos of people getting this procedure and they are surprised when it’s done at how well they can see… That’s not my case. I’m panicking! WTF was I thinking? I can’t see ANYTHING! I place my hand in front of my face and it literally touches my nose for me to see it clearly. I reach for my phone as an impulse but nothing, can’t even see the time. 

“Alright Nicole, now that you’ve had a little time to settle, let me see how everything looks” I know it’s Dr. Randolph but I can’t see him, I only see a withe blob. “Nice, everything looks good” Now its recovery time. I’ll recommend you coming tomorrow to get you eye exam and make your brand new glasses, your eyes have gone through enough for today. I got you this pair I had as an advertisement of essilor labs. They will help you for now, but your prescription would be at least 5 diopters stronger.” He said as he placed a pair of glasses on my hand.

“Thank you so much, you are my fairy godfather Dr. Randolph I truly appreciate this” I said while putting on the glasses

WOW! I want to scream, this is so cool!!!! I can’t really see that much, who would think only 5 diopters could make such a huge difference? I can absolutely navigate now, but man am I feeling blind right now.

Dr. Laura offers to take me to my hotel room, which happens to be very near the clinic, but as I can’t do too much effort right now, I appreciate the ride and the company. 

I am mesmerized, everything is so blurry on a distance, but so clear when I’m focusing a few inches away. Dr. Laura helps me into my room, she is so nice. I have nothing but good things to say about the mexican people. A male nurse even said glasses suit me and I was the prettiest girl with glasses he’s seen. 

As much fascination as I have right now, my head hurts from the focusing I’m trying to do, so I take off my clothes and get into bed for a good sleep. 

_______________________________________________________________________________



My glasses turned out to be -25.5 and -26.75, I guess my attempts to gain myopia weren’t so bad after all.
 Dr. Randolph said they should be ready today at 6pm. I’m so exited, I can’t wait to get them. Being 5 diopters under corrected isn’t funny at all. I really really understand myopic people now, I guess I’m one of them!

I’ll get my stuff ready and as soon as I have my glasses I’ll go out to say goodbye to the beautiful Mexico city.

_______________________________________________________________________________

“Miss Nicole, your glasses are ready” said Dr. Laura “Can you please try them so I can adjust them?”

“Yes, thank you very much” I said while I had the rush of my life by putting them on “WOW, everything looks so sharp, is like having HD” I said

“Haha, thats actually a good way to describe it, Dr. Randolph said you could keep the loaner pair as a souvenir” 

I feel them heavy on my nose and ears, but they are comfortable. I thank Dr. Laura and very carefully walk out the clinic. 

Everything looks so far away, its like looking through a car mirror, it looks small, and if I move only my eyes to the sides of the glasses, I can’t see I have to move my head instead.

I don’t know if its the pleasant experience or if its just the fact that everything over here seems to be beautiful but I’m falling in love with this city, I’m having a cup of coffee as a goodbye to Mexico and the view is amazing. The “bellas artes” palace is in front of me and looking at it with glasses and then taking them off and seeing nothing but a white huge blur is amazing.

Too bad it’s time to go to the airport now…

To be continue...
