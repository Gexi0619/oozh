 Jenna was lying across the couch with her head on a pillow on my lap. We were watching a pay per view movie on the big screen television in my apartment and this was the first time we had been together alone – without at least one other couple. We had originally met at a small gathering of mutual friends a few weeks ago, and I had been intrigued by this dark haired large chested long-legged beauty with the ultra thick glasses. Since our first meeting I had been dating her every chance I could get.
 
I glanced down at her head as she lay on the pillow. Thank goodness for the pillow as I am sure that without it, she would have been able to feel my erection. Tonight, Jenna’s hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and I could see the side of the right lens of her glasses. Back when I was born, in the early 90’s, the 13mm thickness of her lens would have indicated a prescription of around -10D, maybe even up to -12D, but with the high index lenses of today - almost 30 years later, her lenses could have been as strong as -25D to show this much edge thickness. I had been very careful over the past 6 weeks to ensure that I said nothing about her eyesight or glasses, and I could only hope that my apparent lack of interest would show her that her glasses and her eyesight were of no concern to me. I knew from past experience that girls who wore glasses, especially glasses that were as strong as Jenna wore, were generally fairly self-conscious about them. 
 
While I was dying to talk with Jenna about her glasses, I knew that asking her if she ever wore contact lenses might lead me down a road I didn’t want to go down. Girls with prescriptions as strong as Jenna usually always wore contacts. For one thing, with as strong a prescription as Jenna needed, contact lenses gave the wearer a bit better visual acuity. Jenna might not be able to drive wearing her glasses, but she likely could with contact lenses. Another reason for a girl with this strong a prescription to be wearing glasses for the 6 weeks I had known her might be that she had possibly over worn her contacts and she needed to wear glasses while her eyes recovered – if they ever did. And possibly she had developed an eye infection such as pink eye, which prevented the wearing of contact lenses. The worst possible reason in my view would be that Jenna was wearing glasses so that her corneas would return to the natural curvature of her eye so that she could be accurately measured for inner eye lens implants, and then she would no longer need glasses. For the time being it was safer for me to say nothing and hope that the subject would come up in a conversation that was initiated by her. 
 
The movie ended and I asked Jenna if I should drive her home now, or if she wanted to sleep over. I explained that she could either share my Queen bed, or else sleep in the guest room. I had a guy renting my spare bedroom for a while but when I had to start working from home he moved out and I invested in a futon as well as a computer desk and chair, so it was sort of like a home office setup.
 
“I will share your bed, but you have to be careful of my glasses.” Jenna said.
 
“Don’t you take them off?” I queried.
 
“When the lights go out, I do.” She replied. 
 
True to her word, Jenna left her glasses on while we made love. After we finished, we lay in each other’s arms for a while, and finally she got up to have a shower. My shower is rather small so there is not enough room for two. I waited until Jenna finished and then I also showered. She had left her glasses on while she showered and I suppose that would have been a good time to ask her if she really needed to wear them in the shower, but I kept my mouth shut. The next morning, I woke up first and went to use the toilet. When I came back to bed Jenna was awake, and already had her glasses on. She got up after I got back into bed and went to the bathroom herself. When she returned to bed, she didn’t take her glasses off, but just lay there looking at me through the strong lenses. She aroused me sexually again, and before long we were making love. Afterwards we lay around for a while in each other’s arms before she told me that she needed to get up. She showered first again, and I followed her. When she got out of the shower her glasses were all water spotted so I took my clean cotton T shirt and I offered to clean her glasses for her. As I rubbed the lenses clean, I could feel the deep indentations of the back of the lenses, and it started to arouse me again. I gave her glasses back to her and she put them on as I got into the shower, so I don’t think she noticed my erection.
 
Jenna was dressed and was in the kitchen making coffee when I finished dressing. It was Saturday and I didn’t need to go anywhere, but I suspected that she did from the way she decided it was time to get dressed. We had coffee and a muffin, and I asked Jenna if she had to be somewhere today. She told me that she was meeting her sister for lunch and surprised me when she asked if I wanted to come along. I said I would love to go with her, and I think she was pleased with that.
 
The area where we were meeting Carmen was downtown. Parking was scarce, and expensive, so I suggested that we would be better off using transit rather than driving. This got me a little bit of an eye roll behind those thick lenses as if to say: “Duh, how did you think I was getting there?”, but Jenna didn’t say a word. We both had bus passes and we got to the restaurant where we were meeting her sister before we were expected, Carmen was very similar in appearance to Jenna, except that she did not wear glasses. Standing side by side Jenna appeared to be slightly taller, but both ladies had similar figures, and both were well endowed in the upper chest area. I was pretty sure there was no augmentation there.
 
As we sat chatting while waiting for our lunch, I figured that Carmen was wearing contact lenses. I couldn’t spot them in her eyes, but the way she scrunched her eyes up and then rapidly blinked a few times convinced me that she likely had contacts in. I mentioned that her contacts must be bothering her, and she admitted that she had slept in them, which was allowed as they were designed for an occasional overnight, but she still preferred to remove them every night.
 
“Has he asked you the ten questions yet?” Carmen asked Jenna.
 
“Nope, note even one of them.” Jenna replied.
I was mystified as to what they were talking about. But I was soon to find out, and I was really happy I had kept my mouth shut and had refrained from asking Jenna any questions about her eyesight. I know that a lot of guys in my position would have wanted to know a few things, but I have what I consider to be a glasses fetish and I have done enough reading about vision defects to know quite a lot about myopia. In the past I had made a few mistakes, such as asking too many questions too soon, and I know that had caused a few of my past myopic girlfriends to shy away from me. I had learned to let the lady bring up the topic first, and this way I was able to keep my girlfriends around longer.
 
“What are the ten questions?” I asked.
 
“When you need really strong glasses like Carmen and I do, there are usually 10 questions that most of the guys that date us ask within the first 2 or 3 dates. We have gone out 6 times and you haven’t asked one of them. The closest you have come to mentioning my glasses was to ask last night if I took them off when I slept.” Jenna said.
 
“What are these ten questions?” I asked.
 
“They do not come in any specific order, but Jenna and I have noticed that there are ten things’ people generally ask us about our glasses and our eyesight.” Carmen replied.
 
“One that is very common is: Can you see without your glasses?” Jenna said.
 
“And your answer is likely not very much.” I replied.
 
“Correct, and then they generally ask how far I can see clearly without them.” Jenna responded.
 
“Do you then tell them slightly past the end of your nose?” I asked.
 
‘How do you know that? Carmen asked me.
 
“I have been going out with a girl who wears strong glasses for about 7 weeks now. I did some research on the internet because I thought it was too personal and too intrusive to ask her.” I told her.
 
“Well, this guy is no fun Jenna. We might as well end this now.” Carmen said.
 
“No, please don’t. I am interested in this.” I responded.
 
“Ok, well then, in no specific order here are the next 8 questions we most often get; Do your lenses have to be that thick?; Do you ever wear contact lenses?: Can I try your glasses on?; Doesn’t all that weight on your nose make it sore?; Can you take your glasses off and try to read something?; Can you get that laser eye surgery or have some other kind of operation?; Will your eyesight get much worse?; Did you wear glasses even as a baby?; and then there are a couple more really dumb ones, but these are the most popular ones.”  Jenna said.

“Do you want me to try to answer most of the questions for you?  I have never seen you without your glasses so I can’t answer the one about the contact lenses, and I am not sure if you were born with congenital myopia, but I think I can come up with the answers to the other 6.” I spoke.
 
“Go ahead, give it a try.” Carmen said.
 
“Yes, my glasses have to be this thick, and these lenses are the thinnest ones available for my prescription. No, you can’t try my glasses on. I feel very helpless without them, and other people trying them on might stretch the shape, so they no longer fit me properly. Yes, they are kind of heavy, but my nose has gotten used to them. I have to bring a book to within about 6 centimeters from the end of my nose, and then I would have to close one eye to be able to read anything. So, there would be absolutely no reason for me to try that. I could possibly have lens implant surgery, but it is very expensive and often leads to the formation of early cataracts, so it would be a waste of money to have surgery before I develop cataracts or until my vision becomes uncorrectable with glasses or contacts. There is a chance my eyesight might worsen, but unless I have pathological myopia it has likely stabilized.” I told them.
 
“This guy is dangerous Jenna.” Carmen said.
 
“Why, just because he got the answers pretty much correct?” Jenna asked.
 
“If he doesn’t have a glasses fetish, he is too well informed to be legitimate.” Carmen answered.
 
“I wouldn’t say I have a huge glasses fetish. I do appreciate an attractive looking girl who wears glasses. That would be why I was attracted to Jenna. You are both very attractive ladies, but wearing glasses makes Jenna stand out in any crowd. And because I was so attracted to you, I wanted to know about any future problems before I fell totally in love with you so that is why I did so much research.” I told Jenna.
 
“What do you mean future problems?” Jenna asked.
 
“Honestly, if you have what is called pathological or degenerative myopia there is a possibility that you could be blind by the time you are in your late 40’s. At this point in my life, I might have a problem with that. If we married and your eyes became a problem in future years, I could accept that, especially if I have now considered that possibility. But I have refrained from discussing your eyesight until you brought it up.” I answered.
 
“All high myopia can be degenerative.” Carmen said.
 
“But we just have bad eyesight. None of the doctors said we were in danger of going blind.” Jenna said.
 
“Maybe not to you Jenna, but he told me that we had to be monitored very carefully every year so that we did not develop any complications such as retinal tearing or other serious problems.” Carmen replied.
 
“I guess he told me about needing to have an eye exam yearly and making sure I didn’t bump my head, but he didn’t really say why.” Jenna said.
 
“Do you wear contacts most of the time Carmen?” I asked.
 
“I prefer wearing contacts. With my glasses it seems that people stare” Carmen answered.
 
I left the conversation about eyesight to end right there. Carmen had answered the most important question and I didn’t think it would improve my relationship with Jenna if I gave the sisters the impression that their glasses – or in Carmen’s case lack of glasses – were of too much interest to me. When lunch was finished Jenna and I left Carmen and went back to my place on the bus.
 
“What did you think of Carmen?” Jenna asked.
 
“She is, like you, very easy to look at. But I have the feeling that she has a bit of a hang up about wearing glasses. I sort of suspect that she might have had a bad relationship. It is possible that she might have been with a guy who was a serious glasses fetishist.” I responded.
 
“You are too darned perceptive. You know enough to not ask any of the questions that upset us, and you are able to pinpoint why my sister doesn’t like wearing her glasses out in public.” Jenna replied.
 
“You could say perceptive, but acceptive.” I answered.
 
“What do you mean by that?” Jenna queried.
 
I explained to Jenna that I was indeed perceptive enough to know that talking about her eyesight was not going to help her, and it might only upset her, as it certainly had seemed to upset Carmen. But I told her that I was acceptive of the fact that she was quite shortsighted and wearing glasses or contact lenses was the only way she could function. I told her that I accepted her wearing glasses, as I would also accept her wearing contacts.
 
The mood sort of lightened after I said that, and we spent an enjoyable afternoon together. I offered to drive Jenna home if she wanted to go, and I was very happy when she said she would like to go home and pick up some clean clothing and some cosmetics. I asked her if that meant she would be agreeable to coming back to spend another night, and when she said yes, I offered to take her.
 
We drove to the apartment that she shared with Carmen, and I went up with her to wait while she grabbed what she wanted. I looked around at some of the pictures and I could see that there were a number of people wearing glasses in her family. Some of the people in the pictures were obviously high myopes. It wasn’t the right time to say anything, so I just asked to use the washroom before I left. On a shelf in the bathroom sat a pair of glasses that looked very similar to Jenna’s, both in style and in lens thickness. I assumed that they were Carmen’s so that meant that the sisters had similar prescriptions. Again, it was not time to say anything, so we headed for the door. There was a picture of Carmen with a very good looking guy on a small table, so I pointed at the picture and asked Jenna if that was the guy who had hurt Carmen. She said it was and since I couldn’t understand why she kept his picture around, this time I did ask. Jenna told me that it was to remind Carmen what jerks guys could be, so I told Jenna that all guys were not jerks.
 
Back at my apartment we had to decide what we were going to do for dinner. I was all for going out to eat, but Jenna searched my fridge and cupboards, and she came up with what we could cook to eat that evening. I helped with the cooking of course and I really enjoyed standing there helping Jenna. The best part was when I was standing slightly behind her and could look through the one lens of her glasses, imagining her beautiful green eyes naturally focusing on everything through the strong minus lenses. At one point her glasses had slipped slightly, and she clenched her fist and took the index finger and the knuckle of her left fist to push her glasses up into the proper place, I was tempted when I was in their apartment bathroom to take Carmen’s glasses and put them on, but I didn’t want to risk either of the girls finding out I had done that. I would be able to get a look through Jenna’s glasses with her permission, and that would work better in the long run.
 
Jenna and I were having a lot of fun together. Most weekends she would stay over Friday and Saturday nights, and we would go out with a few of my friends and their significant others on Friday night. The glasses fetish community is rather small and most of us like to keep a low profile. In a city of over a million people I would think that you might find 3 or 4 guys who have a serious glasses fetish. To run across another guy working for the same company would be a real stretch of the imagination. But Oliver, one of my coworkers, and I had attempted to date the same glasses wearing girl in our office before I met Jenna, and he had ended up being the one who had been with her for a few months before she changed companies. He was now casually dating another girl who also wore glasses, but she had a much lower prescription than his other date, and certainly a lot lower prescription that Jenna and Carmen needed. Oliver was a couple of years older than I am, and Carmen is 18 months older than Jenna so I wondered if I should attempt to set Oliver up with Carmen. Jenna seemed to like Oliver quite well, and I knew Oliver considered me a lucky guy for finding Jenna. Whatever happened would come back to haunt me if it went badly between Carmen and Oliver though, so I had to be careful that nothing would hurt my relationship with Jenna.
 
About a week later I managed to catch Oliver in the lunchroom by himself. I piqued his interest when I told him that I needed to talk with him in private, and I made him give his word that nothing we talked about in the conversation would ever be repeated. Of course,  he was curious, but he did give me his word. I started out by asking him what he thought of Jenna. Oliver and I had never discussed the fact that we both admired ladies who needed strong glasses and our mutual admiration was more like he knew that I knew that he knew that I knew scenario but had never been discussed. Oliver came right out and told me that I had found his dream girl. I told him that I figured that would be the case, and then I asked him if he wanted an introduction to a girl who needed glasses at least as strong as Jenna’s and was every bit as gorgeous as she is. I could almost see his tongue hanging out of his mouth when I told him that Jenna had an older, very nearsighted sister. I told Oliver about the ten questions. I told him that Carmen would not wear her glasses because she had gone through a bad experience with her previous steady boyfriend and that I felt that she needed a bit of time and a boyfriend who would be willing to not say a word about her strong glasses if she should ever decide to wear them in front of him.
 
I thought I had gotten through to Oliver. Now the next step would be to arrange either an accidental meeting, or a casual introduction. Jenna had met, and liked Oliver, so the next time Jenna and Carmen met for lunch lo and behold Oliver was eating at the same place. Jenna introduced Carmen to Oliver, and we let Oliver take it from there. Having been forewarned I was sure that Oliver would be able to impress Carmen, and a few weeks later the 4 of us went to dinner together.  Carmen was still wearing contacts, but after dinner when the girls went to the washroom together Oliver told me that he had seen Carmen wearing her glasses and she looked stunning.
 
Six months later we were all together again for a double wedding ceremony. Both Jenna and Carmen were wearing their glasses, so Oliver had done and said the correct things to Carmen. The 2 sisters would never need their ten questions again.
