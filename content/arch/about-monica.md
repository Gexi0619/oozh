This my second attempt of writing a story
You already know the characters, so here it is:


About Monica  by Val from V&S


Hello everybody, my name is Monica.
Somebody told me that my former boyfriend, Daniel, posted a story online where he mentioned me a lot, so there's no need to present myself.
If some of you don't know me, you can find the story here: writing-prompt-1-the-new-girl-t1804.html .  I am not the main character of this story, Daniel's new girlfriend Anne is.  They are now happy together and so am I with my new boyfriend Adrian. 

Now I must rewind a little and go three years back, while me and Daniel were still in Middle school, to tell you my story.

Me and Daniel grew up together.
My mom works hard to raise me.  Daniel and I became very close. We spent a lot of time at each others house, studying or watching movies and (sometimes) kissing (when our parents were not paying attention).
I liked him and he liked me.
So we acted as boyfriend and girlfriend in school. Sometimes we called each other "fiancé", just for fun. 
 
One day, after school, Daniel put a DVD with some foreign romantic movie. French movies are the best when it comes to romance. I know a little french but not enough to understand everything so I had to read the subtitles.
I find myself talking:
- Daniel, you should change your TV set, buy a bigger one. These days you can find very good offers.  
- Why do you think I need a bigger screen ?
- Because you always watch foreign movies in the original language and it's not so fun to pay attention to subtitles when the text is so small.
- The text seems OK to me. And you know that I like to hear how the words sound in the original language. To learn more and perfect my speaking.
- Let move from the sofa and go the armchair.
- It's not that confy, but If you want, let's do it.

.... later on ....

- I have enjoyed the movie, Daniel. You have good taste in movies. 
- I've seen your tears at the of the movie,  even if it was a happy ending. ... That makes me wonder..,  last year when you had your eye-check you said it was all OK, are you sure it was ?
- Well, not so OK.
- What do you mean ?
- I ended up with a prescription for glasses.
- You never said anything about it.  Do you remember the numbers on the prescription ?  
-  It was something like -0.75  and -0.5  if I recall correctly. And it was something else, another -0.25 with two drawings with half circles, with some angles marked.  The doctor said it's up to me if I want to wear glasses, so I chose not to do it.
- At -1 Diopter, with glasses you should see the difference.
- But it's only -0.75, starts with a zero, why do you round up ?
- -0.75 or -1 is the same.
- You boys, always try to make it simple,  but when you compare it, is bigger.  
- When it comes to numbers, maybe. But that was last year, I think you should go for another eye check and see the result. You should talk to your mom for this.
- Let's surprise her. I have the phone number, we can make an appointment. The insurance is already in the file so it won't be a problem.

.... phone ringing....

- Hello, this is the doctor's office, my name is Diana, how may I help ?
- Hello, I am Monica Sims, and I want an appointment for a check-up.
- ... Monica, hello again, I see that you are due for a check-up in three months, but, if you want the doctor can see you on Thursday at 4 PM.
-  That's perfect, please make the appointment. 

Thursday - Monica exiting the doctor's office with test glasses on

- Monica, take a few steps on the hall way, look around, and tell if you like how you see now.
- Yes, doctor.
Daniel approached her.
-  Well Monica, how is it?  Is it better ?  said Daniel.
Monica tried to lift the glasses, to see without them. And put the glasses back on a few times.
- I can see a difference, the distance look clearer, but with this glasses on I get a little dizzy.
The doctor over  heard, and said:
- Don't worry Monica, after you will get accustomed to wearing glasses, that will disappear.

Monica, for herself : "Accustomed to wearing glasses ? That will never happen...". She gave back the glasses and took the paper slip the doctor gave her. 

Daniel was waiting for her. Monica did not let him say anything, she started first: 
- The doctor said my eyes are healthy. Everything is OK.
- Everything ? We have to choose some frames for your glasses.
- Let's not do this today. I'm fine, I can see fine. We can come back next week. I am hungry, lets's go grab a pizza.
- We can go get a soda, but for pizza we will go later, first we have to wait for your mom.
- What !?  You told my mom ?
- Of course I did. And you were right, that was a surprise for her.

Mrs. Sims came, and gave her daughter a big hug.

- Monica dear, how are you, tell me please ?
- I'm OK.
- I'm relieved to hear that. Wait for me a little I will go and talk to the doctor.
- Mom, there's no need to, I said I am OK. Let's go eat something, I am starving.
- I am sorry hear, but you will have to bear a little longer. First you have to give me what the doctor gave to you.
- Here it is. I have a prescription for glasses. The doctor said it's a low prescription and it is not mandatory to get glasses now.
- Let's see : " Left Eye :  -1.25  0   0;  Right Eye :  -1 -0.25 15 ".  Darling, there's no need to argue. This paper says everything. We shall go and choose a nice frame for you.  Choose wisely, because you will have to wear them. Find some frames you really like.

We settled for a plastic frame with bright colors, blue and red, perfect for a teenager. After that, we went to get that pizza, while waiting for the glasses to be ready.
