Lost and Found.



My name is James [ Jimmie,] I live in small city with my mother , a  full time working single parent..
In the fall I will be going to  High School, but first the summer break

This year as usual , I will be  spending the  summer with  my mothers sister Margaret and her husband  who live on a farm. , so  my mother does not have to worry about me while she is at work..
I like helping on the farm and have a great time with their  son Logan who is  a year older than I am.
To make sure I have all I might need, Mom packed my suitcase , and gave me me some  spending money and  money for  my bus ticket, and told me to behave myself.
On her way to work ,  Mom dropped me off at the bus station.

I had to wait for about an hour before the bus was due to leave.
No better way to kill time than to sit on a bench , to watch people coming and going .
When a city bus was just about ready to leave , a woman and a boy about my age came  walking out of the bus station
I heard her say, Carl you know you  are supposed to wear your glasses , now for heavens sake , start wearing them..
I hate glasses and I am not going to wear them.
While the woman boarded  the bus said, yes ,you will wear them , and Carl said no I won t.
When Carl walked past me to board the bus ,he tried to throw a glasses case into a garbage can , but missed , and the case fell beside the can.
He climbed on the bus ,and soon they were gone.

Curiousity made me get up  and pick up the glasses case.
I  sat down  and slowly opened the case ..
In the case was a nice shiny  pair of dark brown plastic framed glasses.
While taking the glasses out of the case , I noticed that the frame seemed to have a nice feeling to it .
This was the first time I ever had a pair of glasses in my hand.
The lenses looked so nice and clear , 
I could not resist it , I wanted to find out  ,what wearing glasses was like , and what you can see when you wear them.
Carefully  I put the glasses on , I liked the  nice feel of the frame on my face.
I looked across the street and everything looked  a little smaller but very clear and well defined,
When I took the glasses off , everything  looked fuzzy.
I tried again, and looked around  with and without glasses . 
It was unbelievable , when  wearing the glasses , I can see every little detail in the distance.
What a surprise that I can  see  so much better when wearing the glasses.
I always had been sure, that  I had perfect vision.
Now I wondered what do  I look like wearing glasses.
Carrying my suitcase  into the station ,went to the bathroom so I could look in a mirror.
When  I looked in the mirror  ,  was surprised  how different I looked..
I  liked the way I looked wearing the glasses.
Since I could see so much better , and liked the looks and  feel of the glasses on my face,
I was going to wear the glasses.
There I was boarding the bus wearing glasses , I felt very important.
I took a window seat and got comfortable for the one hour bus ride.

The bus was just about to leave , when a midddle aged woman sat in the seat beside me.
She asked me where I was going , so I told her.
Well, I will  be getting off a few  stops before yours.
Then she complimented me on how good I looked wearing glasses. 
She asked me how long I had been wearing glasses.
I told her I had started wearing glasses  a couple of months ago.
Well you are a  very smart boy  to wear your  glasses .,
I visited my sister , and my  nephew Carl , who is about your age  and has to wear glasses .
He  refuses to wear them.
His glasses are very similair to the ones you are wearing.
She kept  on talking till she arrived at her stop, I was glad to see Carl s aunt  go., 
I am sure, she  could talk the ears off an elephant.
Now I got a chance to  enjoy all the scenery in peace , while wearing Carl s  glasses.


When I got to my stop ,forgot all about me wearing  glasses.
Aunt Margaret and Logan were there waiting for me.
After I got a big hug , aunt Margaret looked   at me  said well you sure have grown quite a bit since you were here last year . 
You  look so nice  and grown up .
I see you   are  wearing glasses now,  they look very nice.
Do you wear your glasses all he time?
I told her I did .
Your mother did not mention that you are wearing glasses now.
Logan is  also wearing glasses  ,but he does not wear them as often as he should..
Well let s get into the car and  go home .

When Logan and I got together after lunch ,I asked him about his glasses.
I like wearing them, but when I wear them  , the glasses make me feel so turned on and sexy .
Now , I only wear them when I can relieve myself, perhaps I can get over this feeling.
Here try my glasses do they make you feel different.?
Logan put my  glasses on and said your prescription is not like mine . 
It is the feel of the glasses on my face and looking through the lenses that turns me on.
Well I sure would like to try your glasses .
We went to Logans  [ our] bedroom and he  showed me his glasses.
I put his glasses  on and everything I looked at  was blurry .
Logan told me that the optometrist had told him he was hyperopic and had some astigmatism.
The glasses are great for reading , and I can see in the distance now.
But every time I wear the glasses I get turned on ,  look at the bulge in my pants .
This is when my summer education started .

When my aunt  was talking on the phone to my mother , she  told her how handsome I looked wearing glasses , and how good I was wearing my glasses all the time.
When my mother talked to me ,she wanted to know about the glasses I was wearing.
I told her that I had found them , and when I had tried them  on , realized I could see so much better,
so I started  wearing the glasses .
She told me , I will make an appointment for you. 
I want to make sure that if you have to wear glasses , you are wearing the right prescription.
I was glad that my mother now knew I wore glasses.
I liked wearing glasses and  was looking forward to my eye exam , and a proper prescription. 


Time to go home.

This was a summer to remember., I grew some more ,muscled  up a little, and had started to wear glasses .   
Logan had  taught me about a lot of things that boys my age do , and that I  should know about..
I also learned more about glasses ,  hyperopia, myopia and astigmatism .
When leaving I thanked my aunt and uncle, for another great summer.
Riding home on the bus I was looking forward to see my mother again , and of course an eye exam.

When I arrived home my mother looked at me .
Jimmie I can t believe how much you grew .
My son a very  handsome , glasses  wearing young man.
I notice you are wearing glasses for myopia like I do .
Your eye appointment is  for to morrow.

A new experience for me , an eye exam.
I  asked a lot of questions , and told the optometrist about finding the glasses.
When the eye exam was finished the optometrist told me that I was lucky finding glasses so close to my actual prescription 
He told me that he increased my prescription 1/2  diopter for each eye.
Mom helped me select a new frame , that she told me would make me look even more handsome.
When my glasses were ready and I put them on ,  loved the improvement of my vision compared to Carl s glasses .
The new frame looked fantastic , I loved my new glasses .
I put the Carl s  glasses in my dresser drawer.

Starting High School is a whole new experience.
When I arrived at the school ,  I met a lot of my former class mates.
I received a lot of comments about  me wearing glasses now.
I noticed that there are of course a lot of students from other schools 
Looking around was surprised that so many  students are wearing glasses now.
I enjoyed High School, going to all the different classes and have  different teachers for different subjects.


About a week later , in math class , the guy beside me asked me if  I could help him.
He had trouble reading what was on the blackboard .
I showed him  my notes and gave them to him after class so he could copy them.
He thanked me , and asked me if he could sit beside me more often.
I did not know the guy , but he seemed  a pleasant type , so I told him I would help him.
He  looked familiar to me ,but could not remember why.
I told him my name.
Thank you Jimmie , my name is Carl.
Now I remembered.
I asked him why he did not wear glasses ?
Well I lost my glasses and my parents refuse to buy me new ones ,
They told me  glasses cost a lot of money.
If I wanted new glasses , I could go  and  earn some  money doing odd jobs, until I have saved enough   to buy new glasses.
I am still short about a hundred dollars , to buy a decent looking pair of glasses.
Do you remember where you might have lost your glasses ?
It was at the bus station , I was mad and dropped them.
Well perhaps I can help you ., I will see you at math class to morrow.

Now I was pretty sure who the glasses that I found at the bus station belonged to.
The next day , I took the glasses out of my dresser drawer and put them in my bag.
When I sat down in math class Carl was there.
I took the glasses out of my bag , are these by any chance the glasses you lost ?
Yes ,they sure  look like them ,where did you get them?
So I told him the whole story , about  him throwing the glasses away .
Trying his glasses and realizing I  could see so much better , and deciding  to wear them 
His aunt sitting beside me on the bus, and telling me about Carl not wanting to wear his glasses.
Wearing his glasses for the summer and  after having  an eye exam , and  now having  my own new prescription. 
I gave Carl his glasses, he put his glasses on and looked around.
Well I sure was a fool not to appreciate the improved vision glasses give you , and refusing  to  wear them
Thank you for the glasses, that  stupid me, lost on purpose.
I can t believe it ,I have my glasses again .
The glasses  I  Lost and  you Found .
