description: High school student Greg discovers the transformative power of glasses, thanks to his crush Lindsay's influence.
---
Greg was in high school , a good student and a regular guy who always had an eye for pretty girls.
To day he noticed that Lindsay , one of his class mates , a cute girl with lovely long black hair, came to school wearing glasses.

Lindsay , who had always wanted to wear glasses , was very happy when she failed her vision test for her drivers license .
She had not realized her vision was not perfect.
When she had her eye exam , and was prescribed glasses for myopia., selected a frame that she really liked , and when she got her glasses could not believe the improvement in her vision  .
She loved her new look  and was very proud wearing her new glasses that she had always wanted.


Greg had always liked Lindsay she was a very pleasant , good looking girl, and they dated regularly.
Now looking at her he could not believe how nice she looked wearing glasses.
He had never realized glasses could make a person look so attractive.
Greg complimented Lindsay on her new look , she smiled and thanked him.

About a week later, they had a date and went to see a movie.
Lindsay told Greg how happy she was with her glasses.
She liked her new look and could see so much better now., and when going to a movie it did not matter where she sat.
Greg told her she looked beautiful wearing glasses , and really liked her new look.
During the movie , Lindsay noticed that Greg seemed to squint quite a bit, so she asked him if he would like to try her glasses.
Why not, I never tried glasses before , and when he put the glasses on everything seemed to look a bit more clear.
When he gave the glasses back to Lindsay, said they do make everything a bit more clear.
That is very interesting, have you ever had your eyes tested Greg?
No, I have not.
Well perhaps you should.
Lindsay who loved the looks of men wearing glasses , after the movie suggested they go for a little stroll around the mall and do some window shopping.
When they walked past the optical store , Lindsay said she would like to go in for a minute and look around.
I always like looking at frames and trying them.
She was hoping that perhaps she could get Greg to try some frames, she was dying to find out what Greg would look like wearing glasses.
Greg followed her into the store.
Lindsay looked at some frames  and then asked Greg, would you please try some .
I would like to see what you would look like wearing glasses.
Greg obliged and tried some of the frames that Lindsay suggested.
I knew it , you look fantastic wearing glasses, you are beautiful, look at your self.
Greg had to admit he looked pretty good wearing those frames, but he was sure he did not need glasses.

Lindsay loved Greg, and he would look absolutely perfect wearing glasses , she was sure going to try to make her wish come true.

On their next date , Greg and Lindsay bought some take out food, and then drove to a nice scenic spot  overlooking a beautiful valley.
They sat at a picnic table , enjoyed their food and had a great time.

Lindsay had planned this outing because she was sure Greg needed glasses and she was going to prove it.
Lindsay started to point out certain areas , or buildings and ask for Greg s opinion
I have trouble to see what you are talking about'.
You must be blind., right over there,I still cannot see what you are talking about.
Here try my glasses , they might help you see .
When Greg put the glasses on and looked around said, yes now I can see what you were talking about, I can see everything nice and clear.
Just like I thought, you need glasses.
Yes I think you might be right, wearing your glasses sure helped me see what you were talking about.
I will have to talk to my parents about getting an eye exam.
When Greg talked to his parents , they agreed he should have an eye exam.
They made all the arrangements, and Greg was due for his eye exam on Saturday.
Lindsay was all excited and went with Greg to the optical store.
When Greg had his eye exam, Lindsay selected a number of frames that she thought would look just great on Greg.
After the exam , Greg told Lindsay that he was prescribed glasses,
She said that does not surprise me, I have already selected some frames that I am sure will look great on you.
She showed Greg the frames she had selected ,and he patiently tried them on, and waited for Lindsay s approval.
Finally they decided on a frame they both liked.
Now Lindsay could not wait for the glasses to be ready.
When they went to pick up Greg s glasses, and he put them on, right away noticed a big improvement in his vision, and was happy the way he looked.wearing glasses.
Lindsay looked at him and said you look fantastic , your eyes look so nice behind the lenses, I love your new look.
When they went home they tried each others glasses , and realized their prescriptions were almost identical.

The following week at school Greg received many compliments on hi new look.

On their next date , Greg told Lindsay he was glad she had realized he needed glasses.he now liked wearing them.
Wearing glasses made him feel confident,, he could see much better, and was happy with his new look.
Lindsay gave him a hug and a kiss, and said you are the most beautiful glasses wearing guy , all mine , and I love you.
