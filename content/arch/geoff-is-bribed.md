description: A reluctant glasses-wearing boy earns a piercing by wearing his specs, leading to unexpected lifelong benefits.

In 1993 9 year old Geoff was prescribed glasses for mild Myopia with a prescription of -1 right and .75 left. Geoff didn't have any trouble seeing the boards at school so he never wore his glasses. What was unusual about Geoff is his Myopia had stayed the same for 2 years as shown at his 1995 eye exam. In 1995 11 year old Geoff announced to his parents he would like to get his left ear pierced. His parents who were a bit "old school" were against this but couldn't pass up a chance to make a deal. Wear your glasses at least in school for one year and you can have your ear pierced. Geoff took them up on the offer and starting wearing his glasses all day in school and even sometimes out of school. When the year was up Geoff's parents said ok Son you earned the right to get your ear pierced and asked do you want one or both pierced. Geoff said just the left ear although his parents having come around a little on pierced ears for boys thought the kids looked better with both ears done. The big day came and Geoff's Mom took him to the mall for the piercing in which he was wearing his glasses. A funny thing happened in the store. Geoff saw a very young child getting her ears pierced crying and chickened out. Geoff said forget it. Geoff's parents asked are you still going to wear your glasses like your supposed to and he said yes I have gotten used to them and by now was wearing them nearly all the time. By high school graduation in 2002 at age 18 Geoff prescription had only increased to -1.25 right and -1.00 left but he was still wearing his glasses all the time. Geoff graduated college in 2006 with still no increase in prescription. Today Geoff who married in 2007 and has an 11 year Son who was prescribed glasses at age 8 with a -2 in both eyes and is very willing to wear them. Geoff's Son's glasses are still stronger then his as his right eye increased to -1.25 or the same as his left eye. Geoff's wife does not wear glasses yet. Geoff told his Wife one time if his son wanted 1 or both ears pierced he doesn't know what to bribe him with as he wears his glasses all the time. Geoff even had to get his Son some sports specs for rough play.
