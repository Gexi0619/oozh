Amy’s glasses..


I live, in a neighbourhood with a lot of young people, about my age.
We play a lot of sports, have a couple of good baseball teams, and we all, love to go to the swimming pool, in the summer.
A number of our parents, are team coaches, or referees, and we always have some parents, and their children, watching our games.
All those people watching, made me feel very important, and to play the best, I can..
We have a mixed team, of both boys and girls, and I know, that some of the girls on our team, are very good baseball players
.
I don’t know, what happened to Amy, to night, she came to the game, wearing glasses.
I could not believe it, how does she expect, to play ball wearing glasses ?
She had a hit, every time she was at bat, and made some real good catches, playing in the outfield, and was the star player, in to night’s game, I still cannot believe it.


My name, is Paul, and my best friend is Randy, who, lives next door, we have been friends for a long time.
We spend a lot of time together, and have no secrets, we might as well be brothers.
On the way home from the ball game, we discussed, Amy wearing glasses now, and her hitting.
Randy is sure, that because Amy wears glasses, she now, can see the ball coming, and don’t forget, her timing has always been good.
I have heard my older sister, talking about her glasses., 
Sarah, who as you know, wears glasses now, told us, that everything, she looks at far away, is so nice and clear now, and not fuzzy looking anymore.
I now know, that everything you look at, that is far away, should be nice and clear, and, if it is not, you need to wear glasses.
Well, Randy sure explained it, now I have some idea, why Amy’s hitting was so good.


We have something to look forward to, when our team coach, told us that,
the whole team, is going to watch, a professional baseball game.
We will be going by bus, to Toronto, to watch a Blue Jays baseball
game.
That sure was exciting news, I have never been in a big stadium, to watch a professional ball game there, it is like a dream come true. 
We are going there next Saturday, and I am sure looking forward to it.


We boarded the bus, that will take us to the ball game.
Randy and I sat behind Amy, and her friend Sadie, and I listened, to their conversation, when, they were talking about, having to wear glasses.
Amy, was telling Sadie, how she likes her glasses, and her improved vision.
Sadie after a little while, tried wearing the glasses, to see if they improved her vision, and told Amy, she noticed how everything looked, more defined, and now wonders, if she should be wearing glasses.
I asked Randy, if he had heard the discussion.
Yes, I have, my sister found out she should have an eye exam, after she tried Jennie’s glasses, girls like trying, each others glasses.
Randy, I am all confused, but have a feeling, that perhaps, I should have an eye exam, far away objects, are not to clear.


When we arrived at the stadium, we had a chance, to look at all the souvenir shops, and I counted my money again, to see, what I could afford to buy.
We settled down in our seats, almost half way up, behind the first base line. 
Randy, and I could not believe how big the stadium is, and before we knew it, the players were on the field.
I had never realized, that the field was so big, that the far end looked fuzzy to me, and during the game, I had trouble seeing the ball, when I mentioned it to Randy, he told me he had no problem, he could see everything, just fine.
During the seventh inning stretch, Amy, asked Randy, to look after their stuff for a minute, while they went to the washroom.
Randy, noticed, that Sadie, had left her glasses.
After the girls had gone, Randy asked me, would you like to try some glasses?
Amy, left her glasses with her stuff, would you like to try Amy’s glasses.
Yes, I sure want to find out, what I can see, wearing glasses.
Here they are, and Randy handed me the glasses.
Wow, the glasses felt so delicate, in my hands, I slowly put them on, and looked around.
I could not believe my eyes, I was able to see everything, on the far side of the stadium, so nice and clear.
No fuzzy spots in the distance, those little pieces of glass, in front of my eyes,
made it, so I can see everything perfectly, I found it hard to believe.
Now, I know, I should be wearing glasses, no wonder Amy, can play ball so well.
I sure would like to have glasses like that.

Paul, what are you think you are doing, wearing my glasses ?
Sorry Amy, I have trouble seeing far away, and Randy suggested I try your glasses.
I hate to give the glasses back to you, I can see everything, so nice and clear now., while I handed her the glasses.
Well Paul, you will just, have to get your own glasses, I need mine.


After, I came home that night, my dad wanted to know, if something had happened, 
He had noticed, that Amy seemed upset with me.
So, I reluctantly, told him what had happened, that I had trouble seeing the opposite side of the field clearly, and Randy had suggested I try Amy’s glasses.
When I did, and realized how the glasses improved, my vision, Amy came back, and saw me wearing her glasses. 
Well, if you need glasses, we will have to get you a pair. 


About a week later, I was sitting, in the optical store, and waiting, for my eye exam.
I knew, I needed to wear glasses, but what will I look like wearing glasses ?
Are the guys, going to make fun of me?
I guess, I will find out.
At last, I was asked to take a seat, and the doctor, asked me some questions, while looking in my eyes.
Then, I had to start reading some letters, and there were quit a few, that I could not see to well..
All I heard, was some clicking, it looked like he flipped the lenses, and then, which is better 1 or 2, until, he swung the over size glasses away.
Paul, you will need to wear your glasses, all the time, when he handed me a piece of paper with some figures on it, which I now realize, was my prescription.
Thank goodness, my mother was with me, to help, select a frame, and after the optician, took some measurements, told us the glasses would be ready in about an hour..


While we waiting for my new glasses to be ready, my mother told me how surprised she was, that I needed to wear glasses, but, that she is sure, with the frame we chose, I will look very nice.
An hour is a long time to wait, and there is to much to think about.


When the optician, handed me my glasses to put on, so she could adjust them, 
I noticed, that the frame of the glasses, was feeling very comfortable..
When I looked at myself in the mirror, had to agree with my mother, I looked pretty good.
Looking around, was a whole new experience, everything I looked at, was nice and clear, and no fuzzy look, when I looked at distant objects, everything I looked at ws so nice and clear.
I am sure glad, I tried Amy’s glasses


By the time, Randy, came to get me, to go the park, for our ball game, I was very comfortable, wearing my new glasses, and I had some good hits, and the nicest part was, I heard no nasty remarks.


I now am a happy, glasses wearer, I like my glasses, and my improved vision.
If it had not be for Randy, suggesting I try, Amy’s glasses, I would not be wearing glasses now.
Every time I see Amy, I remember the day, that changed my life , when I tried AMY’S glasses.
