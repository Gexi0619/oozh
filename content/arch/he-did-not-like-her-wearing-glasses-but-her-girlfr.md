He did not like her wearing glasses, but her girlfriend  does. 

I am Carolyn, I have an older sister Ashley, and my best friend is Kim
Kim and I, had a great time to day, after the ballgame, we went for a swim.
Next week we start our last year of high school.
I am staying home to night, because Kim has a date, she has a steady boyfriend,
I don t have to many dates, most guys bore me, I prefer the company of girls.

To night at supper, my mother told us, she met a very nice women. who with her family had just moved into town.
They will be going to the same church as we do, so we all have a chance to meet them.
It will be nice to have some new friends.

School has started.
To day in math class,  sitting as usual close to the back, noticed I had a lot of trouble reading
what was written on the blackboard.
I noticed Kelley, who was sitting in the next row, putting on a pair of glasses, and taking notes.
When the class was finished, she took the glasses off, to put them in the case.
Kelley, I did not know you wore glasses.
I have had them for a while, but only use them when I need them, like to day, reading what is on the black board.
I hate to ask you, but can I try your glasses please, I think I have the same problem.
Kelley handed me her glasses, I put them on, looked at the blackboard, and could read everything.
I think I need glasses, I can t believe it, when wearing your glasses, I can read everything.
Thank you Kelley, now, I know what my problem is.
I don t understand it, I had no trouble passing the vision test for my drivers license last year.
When I came home, told my mother, what had happened, when I tried Kelley s glasses. 
Well, we better make an appointment for you, to have an eye exam.
When I told Kim about the eye exam, she was surprised and said she would like to go with me,
 to help select a real good looking frame.
Kim who is farsighted, and has worn glasses since grade three, is familiar with eye exams, and glasses. 
I am sure, she will be a big help.

When we went to the optical store, I knew, I needed to wear glasses, but how would I look wearing glasses, and what will people say?
When we entered the store, I told the lady behind the desk who I was.
She handed me a form to fill out, and after it was completed, took me to the examination room.
The lady optometrist was a very pleasant talkative person, and I really enjoyed the exam.
When finished, she handed me a prescription for glasses, and told me I was myopic.
She suggested, I come back in about 6 months, as she expects, that then I might need an update in my prescription.

Selecting a frame with Kim helping, was fun, and it took us a while,  to find the right frame..
I don t know, if I will like my glasses wearing look, but Kim is sure I will kook fantastic.
The optician took the frame for measurements, and told us the glasses would be ready in about an hour.

When you do not know what to expect, and have a stomach full of butterflies, an hour is an awful long time.
The glasses were ready when we arrived at the store.
The optician handed me the glasses, and I put them on.
After a few adjustments, I had a chance to have a good look at myself.
I liked the looks of my eyes behind the lenses, and I will have to get used to my new look.
When I looked around could not believe the improvement in my vision.
The optometrist explained my prescription to me, I am low myopic the lens for my right eye is -0.75. and my left eye -0.50.
She told me I have to wear the glasses for driving, you can wear the glasses full time, or only if you feel you need to wear them.

I wore the glasses on the bus ride home, and put them on, and took them off, and still can t believe how the glasses improved my vision.
When I came home, my mother told me, she loves my glasses wearing look, you look so studious and more mature.
My sister had to try the glasses, and when wearing the glasses ,walked to the window, and looked out, she could not believe it,  everything she looked at was clear and well defined.
Carolyn, I am going to keep the glasses, they are fantastic.
Logan, Ashley s boyfriend walked into the room.
Ashley, are you wearing glasses? 
Let me have a good look at you, you look fantastic, I love your new look.
Sorry Logan, I am wearing Carolyn s glasses, but if it pleases you, I am sure I will be wearing glasses very soon.
After I put my glasses back on, Logan told me,  I also looked fantastic.
Receiving all the positive comments, made me feel better, having to wear glasses.

The following week at school, I wore my glasses, when I needed them. 
I received many positive comments,  even was asked for a date, which I turned down.
I am now getting used to my glasses, and wear them most of the time.

 About a week later, when I came home from school, my mother said I have a surprise for you. 
Since you have not had any dates lately, I arranged a blind date for you.
You remember me telling you. about the lady and family who moved here, she has a very good looking boy, about your age, and he will pick you up Saturday, to go and see a movie.

Saturday came, and I was ready for my date.
I was upstairs, when my mother called me, and told me my date was here.
When I came down the stairs, saw an overweight, average kind of a guy, a little taller than I am. Carolyn meet Kevin, 
Hello Kevin, nice to meet you.
Riding in the car towards the mall, where the theater is, all Kevin did, was talk about himself,
how smart he is, and all the things he is going to do.
I was not impressed.
When were were seated, and the movie was ready to start, I opened my purse, took my glasses out and put them on.
You wear glasses? 
 I hate glasses, they make you look awful, you sure don t look like the person on the picture that your mother showed me.
Well Kevin. I need glasses to be able to see properly.
I am sorry, I wear glasses and don t look good enough for your taste,.
Thank you, for all your compliments, you are a gentleman. 
I am going now, so you won t be seen with an ugly duckling
Thank you for the ride in, I will take the bus to go home.

When I came home, my mother asked how my evening was.
Very interesting, and please, no more blind dates.
I went upstairs to my room, looked at myself, and decided I looked pretty good, and from now on, 
I will be wearing my glasses all day long
The next day, Kim came over to hear all about my date.
When I finished my story, she had a good laugh, and said I would like to have seen his face.
Now, you can understand why, I like girls better than boys.

I am getting ready to go to college, and am due for an eye exam.
To day I had my eye exam, and as expected an increase in my prescription.
My right eye is now-1.75, and my left eye -2.00.
I love my new glasses, and the way my eyes look behind the stronger lenses.
Wearing glasses, have made me more confident, and now I am sure, I look better when wearing my glasses.

I am now enrolled at our local college, to continue my studies.
I soon realized, the cafeteria is the place to meet new people.
Quite a few guys have given me a good look, and some have even bought me a coffee.
I noticed there sure are a lot of nice looking glasses wearing girls.
I have noticed one girl, I really like the look of, but have not had a chance to talk to.
She has a fantastic head of beautiful hair, a great figure, and wears glasses, with what looks like to me, a strong myopic prescription. 

Kim, knowing the way I prefer girls, suggested to me, that I should check and see if there is a LGBTA club at the college. 
Go to one of their meetings, and find out if you belong there.
I think, that is a real good idea, so I can find out who and what I am.
On the bulletin board, I read the notice of their  meeting, next Thursday night.

On Thursday evening, being early for the meeting, decided to kill some time, and have a coffee in the cafeteria.
When I got there, noticed the girl with the beautiful hair, sitting by herself..
I took my cup of coffee, and walked up behind where she was seated.
Feeling brave, touched the back of her head, and said, what a beautiful wig.
She turned around, looked at me, sorry it is real.
I know, you have such nice hair. 
You mind if I sit down.
No, please do,,I am Sandy, I have noticed you before, I think you are the prettiest glasses wearing girl on campus..
I am Carolyn, thank you for the nice compliment.
Sandy, looked fantastic, wearing a pair of multicolor framed glasses, with I think, about a minus 
5 or 6 prescription.
We soon realized, we were both going to the same meeting. 
I told Sandy, I wanted to find out about my feelings.
Sandy smiled, same here.
So together we went to our first LBGTA meeting.
The meeting with some experienced counselors was very informing.
Sandy and I realize now why we like girls better.
We are so glad we went to the meeting, and now know who we are, so we proudly walked out of the meeting holding hands.
That night at home I told my sister Ashley all about the LBGTA meeting, and meeting Sandy.
She told me she had been wondering about me, and is glad for me to have found my sexual preference.
I now know, that I love Sandy, and I am so happy, she told me she loves the look of me wearing glasses.
She does likes me wearing glasses!
