I will be your glasses wearing girl.






At the age of four, I was prescribed, to wear my first pair of glasses.
After the eye exam, my parents were told, that I was myopic, and for them to expect, that I most likely, 
will be a high myopic, when I grow up.
My first prescription, read O.D. - 1.25 O.S.- 1.50.
At the age of four, you do what you are told to do, and I was a good girl, and wore my glasses, and when I went to pre school,
was very proud of my glasses, because a lot of kids were jealous, because they wanted to wear glasses


When I started to go to school, I was the only girl to wear glasses, and any of the girls, in my class,
who tried to wear my glasses, told me I must be almost blind wearing glasses, that strong.
At that time , I only had a – 2.50 prescription.


My prescription increased every year, about a 1/2 diopter, so by the time I went to high school, 
my lenses showed lots of rings, and made my eyes look smaller, and showed some cut in ,
when I was wearing a – 7 prescription.


Now being in my early teen years and developing a nice young women’s figure, my looks, 
became more important to me.
I have a beautiful head of hair, and can look as good, as any of my class mates.


At my last eye exam, when of course I had another increase in my prescription, 
I was given a chance to be fitted with contact lenses.
Wearing lenses, was a whole new experience, I looked so different not wearing glasses,
and I sure missed the feeling of glasses on my face., and was not sure if I liked my new look.
So I only wore the contacts, once and a while, when I wanted to., I liked wearing my glasses.
That all changed, when my dad came home to day, and he told us we will be moving, 
He will be managing a factory, for the firm he works for, in another town




I don’t know, if I like to give up all my friends, and all our familiar surroundings, but I have no choice.
Having to go to a new school, and making new friends, is not something I was looking for.
So I made the big decision, I am not going to be the girl ,with the coke bottle glasses, 
I am going to wear my contact lenses all the time.
I will look my best, and only wear my glasses, when I feel like it, so nobody knows, I have to wear glasses.




When I started to attend the new high school, I looked like a whole new girl. wearing my contact lenses, 
and sporting a new hairdo.
It did not take me long, to have a couple new friends.
Now, that I know my way around, I feel better, about the move to a new town.
It did not take me long to get into a regular routine, in the morning, wear my glasses, get ready for school,
after I put my contact lenses in, I am on my way
At night, I wear my glasses, and put the glasses on my night table, so they are handy, when I need to wear them.




You sure, never know, what is next.
I had my eye exam this morning, and while I was trying a new frame, for my – 9.00 glasses, 
one of my new girl friends, came into the optical store.
Jenny, are you going to wear glasses?
No, I just having a look to see, what I would look like wearing glasses.
I had my eye exam and the optometrist told me, I am all right till my next eye exam, what about you ?
I am afraid, I will have to wear glasses, I flunked the vision test, for my beginners drivers license, and now wonder, 
what it is like, having to wear glasses.
After trying some frames, Amber said, I am really surprised, how wearing glasses, changes how you look.
Would you mind waiting for me, while I have my eye exam, and help me find an attractive frame for my glasses?
Yes, I will wait, no problem.
I needed that time anyway, to finish with the optician, for my new glasses, and order my stronger contact lenses.
Amber, was prescribed to wear glasses, and we had a great time finding her the perfect frame.




The following week, when my new glasses were ready, I noticed that the edges of the lenses, sure are getting a lot thicker.
I enjoyed wearing my new glasses, at night, and in the morning, but not when going to school,
because I did not want to be told, how blind I am, wearing my glasses.


I have been wearing glasses, for a number of years now, and every year, I started to wear a new pair of glasses,
with a different looking frame.
Because, I like my glasses, could not part with any of them, and I now have quite a collection, of all my old glasses.
I have a nice box, in my top drawer of my dresser, where I keep all my glasses.
I enjoy looking at all those frames, and remembering the time that I wore that particular type of frame.




I always seem to notice everybody who wears glasses..
In my class more than half the students wear glasses, and I wonder how many, like me, are wearing contact lenses.
I have noticed, that there are very few students, who wear a high myopic prescription, most of them are below, minus three,
nobody with a prescription as high as mine.




I have lots of dates, but nothing serious, and love going out, and being active in many of the school clubs.
On some of the dates, when going to see a movie, a lot of the guys seemed to expect , that you to wear glasses,
to see the movie properly.
I always tell them I can see just fine.
I know a lot of guys who love to see a girl wear glasses, but am not sure, if they would like to see me, wear my strong glasses. 
My last pair of glasses is minus 10, and the edges of the lenses are thick and the cut in of my face is more noticeable.
So to be sure, I will keep, wearing my contact lenses.




I now go to university, and do a lot of studying in the library, where I notice, a number of the same students.
To night, I was invited for a coffee, by Kevin a very handsome athletic type of person,.
He was very easy to have a nice conversation with.
When it was time to go home, he asked me for a date., to go and see a movie.
I accepted and he will pick me up Saturday night.


This was the first of many dates, I was going to have with Kevin.
My parents, liked Kevin, and shortly after he was invited to dinner.
Kevin and I spend as much time together, as we could without interfering with our studies.


I had another eye exam, and my new prescription, is in the minus 12 range.
You have no idea, how I loved my new look with the stronger lenses, and a new frame, 
I am almost tempted to wear them all the time, but have no idea, how Kevin feels about a girl, 
who wears high prescription glasses.
I was thinking about that while ,I put my now old glasses, with my collection.




The next Sunday, just before dinner, I heard Kevin talking to my mother, who had invited him to have dinner with us.
I did not know, he was to come for dinner.
Not being dresses for the occasion, I stopped what I was doing, to get myself presentable.
Next thing I know, Kevin is in my bedroom.
Your mother send me up, to see if you are ready to come down.
I will be ready in a minute, I have to go to the bathroom and finish my make up.
Kevin, in the mean time sat on my bed waiting for me.
He admired the furniture, and pulled the top drawer, out to see the construction,
when he noticed all my old glasses.
When I came back into the room, Kevin asked me, do you wear glasses?
Yes Kevin, I do, I started to wear glasses when I was four years old, because I am myopic.
I have been wearing contact lenses, but I will show you what I look like, wearing my new glasses.
Slowly I removed my contact lenses, and put my glasses on.
Now you can have a good look, to see what I look like wearing glasses.
Kevin looked at me, and smiled, when he said, Jenny, you look beautiful, I love your glasses look,
please wear your glasses.
Thank you Kevin, I will wear my glasses, I always liked wearing glasses better than contact lenses.
I will be your glasses wearing girl.
