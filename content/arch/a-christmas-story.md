A Christmas story




My name is Ashley, I am 10 years old, and I have two younger brothers, and are a happy family.
We live on a nice street, not far from the corner of the street, where my best friend Megan lives.
Megan’s dad, died a couple of years ago, and her mother has to go out and work, to make ends meet,
so Megan has to look after her younger brother Kevin, after school is out
Early last spring, Megan’s mother received a note from her teacher, that she might have a vision problem, her mother arranged for Megan’s eye exam, and with the assistance from the local service clubs, Megan, got her new glasses.
When Megan proudly showed me her new glasses, she let me try her glasses, when wearing the glasses I was really surprised, how everything I looked at, was so clear and defined. 
That is how I found out, that I should be wearing glasses.
I told my mother about Megan’s glasses and trying them, and she was very surprised to hear that I might have a vision problem and she arranged for me, to have an eye exam.
As I had expected, I was prescribed glasses, and when my new glasses were ready, I was so happy, to be able to see everything so well, just like when I tried Megan’s glasses.
After I started to wear my new glasses, and tried Megan’s glasses again, realized we have an almost identical prescription.


After I had been wearing my glasses for about 6 months, I started having trouble seeing the blackboard clearly.
When my mother checked with the optical store about my problem, they suggested I should have an other eye exam, so she made an appointment.
After the eye exam, the doctor explained to my mother, that an increase in my prescription, at this time when I was growing, is not unusual, and because there was a 2 for 1 sale, I have now 2 new pairs of glasses.
I love my new glasses, one pair, looks so nice and fancy, that I only wear that pair, on special occasions, for when we go church, or visiting family, the other pair of glasses I wear everyday.
Megan has tried my new glasses and she loves them, she can see so much better when wearing my glasses, and really loves the fancy pair and looks so beautiful wearing them.


It is the beginning of December, and my mother has been putting out some Christmas decorations, to put us in the Christmas mood.
This past Sunday, we went to visit my mom’s sister.
Both my aunt, and her daughter Kelley, commented how well hey like my new glasses
Her daughter Kelley, who is about a year older then I am, a very pretty big built, glasses wearing girl, is like her mother says, growing fast
Ashley, we have a coat that I think, will look very nice on you.
My Aunt showed me the coat, she told us that she had bought it for Kelley last year, but now the coat was to small for her and asked me if I would like it, when she showed me the coat.
Yes, thank you, I sure would like that beautiful coat,
I tried the coat, it sure is a very nice coat, a little to big for me, but my mother is sure, next year, 
I will have grown into it.
Now, I have another beautiful coat.


When I met Megan, on our way to school, she proudly, showed me her new coat, that her mom had bought for her, at a new to you store.
She was so happy to have it, because she had grown out of her old one. 
I am so happy for her to have something that is new to her, that she really likes, because she does not get much, and it is getting closer Christmas, and when the weather gets colder, when you sure need a nice warm coat.


School is finished for the holidays, and there are only three more days before the big day.
I am busy helping my mother with all the housework and we are baking cookies, I want to give some cookies to Megan, and also the mittens I have knitted for her.
We have have been very busy, wrapping presents, and finishing all the decorating, to get ready for the big day.


When on Christmas eve the doorbell rang, we were shocked when we opened the door, and saw Megan standing there crying.
Her new coat was ruined, her glasses had broken, and she had some scrape wounds on her face and hands.
We asked her what had happened.
Between sobs, she told us, that she wanted to bring me her present, and when walking around the corner of the street, a car had come around the corner driving very fast and hopped the curb and had knocked her over, she had fallen against a fence, and the car had driven away, without stopping.
We took her to the bathroom, to clean her up, while my dad phoned the police.
After we cleaned Megan up, and had looked after all her scrapes and bruises, a policeman was there to ask her what had happened.
Poor Megan could not see to well without wearing her glasses, so I went to my room, and handed her my favorite glasses, and told her she could keep them.
Because Megan’s coat was destroyed, my mother handed her the coat that my aunt had given me,
and told her she could have it.
She thanked us with tears in her eyes, she was so happy with he coat and the glasses.
Then I handed her my Christmas present, and the cookies, before my dad and I drove Megan home.
When Megan and I walked into her home, Megan’s mother wanted to know where she got the new coat and glasses.
After she told her mother the whole story, her mother wiped tears from her eyes, and gave us all a big hug, she was so happy, that Megan did not get hurt, and with the nice gifts she had received.
After we had a cup of tea, and wished each other a very Merry Christmas, we went home.
For me, my biggest Christmas joy was, when I gave Megan, my favorite glasses, and when my mother handed her the coat, to see the happy smile on her teared face.
It feels so good when at Christmas you can give, and receive a smile and a thank you. 
The pleasure of giving, is what is Christmas is all about.
