,My introduction to wearing glasses, x 2


We had a no problems living together as a couple, we both did well in our studies, and we sure are enjoying life.
We are doing g.o.c . whenever we have time, I am now using -24.00 glasses, and love the experience, it is fantastic.
Last weekend we spend at Carolyn's home, to come out of the closet.
The results were good, Carolyn's parents had been expecting it, and gave us their blessing, we had not expected that, it was going to be that easy, and that made it a very enjoyable weekend.
We were so happy, to be accepted, and treated like family, now, what about my parents, being an only daughter, and what about my three brothers?
It went better than I expected, because I found out one of my brothers is gay,
and he came out, everybody now realizes that you are what you are, and there is nothing that can be done about it.
My mother was hoping for me to give her a grandchild, so I told her, I would
like to have a child, after graduating and establishing a practice with Carolyn, If she wishes, can make arrangements for semen, to get my eggs fertile. 
She is happy now, and she will make sure that the semen, will be from a perfect male, certainly no glasses. 
After having been accepted by both families as a couple, we got married.


After graduating, we started getting ready, to have our own optical store.
There is a new area in town, with a large number of new houses, a school, and parks, and with our parents help, put a down payment on a house, in a nice, prosperous area, where there is a shopping area, with a doctor and a dentist office, and a number of stores. 
We were lucky, there was a storefront available, that we rented, and, with a good carpenter, build a reception area, a couple of examination rooms, and small lab. and put up our displays.`
We opened the office before school started, and put a sign in front of the store, suggesting eye exams before school started.
It did not take long, for our appointment book to fill up nicely, so we hired a glasses wearing girl, to be our receptionist. 
The girl we hired, likes wearing glasses, and is very good, showing frames to customers, she is a big help, and we are happy our business is starting so well. 
Our sign, in front of the store, sure paid off, a lot of children and preschoolers came in for eye exams, and we were surprised, that so many young children need glasses now. 
Carolyn, gave me an eye exam, and increased my prescription to -5.00,
I love my improved vision, and the looks of my stronger lenses.
Because our optical business is doing better than we had expected, I told my mother, to go ahead and arrange for me to have a baby.




Emily's mother story,
I have made arrangements with the doctor that specializes in fertility, to get Emily pregnant.
He told me it would be less expensive, if I could arrange for a semen donor, that was music to my ears, I would find the perfect donor, a good looking, well build man, with a good personality, and for sure not one wearing glasses.
It was bad enough that Emily wore glasses, and now two of her brothers, are also wearing glasses, and I don't like glasses, it shows weakness 
She had the right person in mind, and would have to talk to him.
The next Sunday after the church service, there he was the perfect male specimen, the son of the minister, who had just finished his studies and was going in a couple of weeks, to his own new church.
I approached him and introduced myself, and asked him if he could do me a favour, I told him that I was looking for a person willing to donate semen. an 
He is willing to help, but it has to be this coming week, because he is moving out of town. 
Perfect, I told him where the doctor was, and I will let him know that you will be there this week.
I informed the doctor, about the semen donor, and asked Emily to get in touch with the doctor.
I feel really good about this, the perfect male semen to impregnate Emily, what I did not know, the donor, is myopic and wears contact lenses, so that nobody could see, his strong, -19.00 myopic glasses.


I went for my appointment to the fertility doctor, he examined me , and told me since I was ovulating, and he had fresh semen, that my mother had approved, it might be a good time to impregnate me, I agreed.
On my next visit to the doctor, he confirmed that I was pregnant.
My mother was very happy when I told her the news.
The pregnancy went well, and both Carolyn and I were looking forward to be parents.
I was very surprised, when I was told, I was carrying twins.
Time goes fast, and I delivered, a healthy boy and girl, who grew fast and sure made our life more interesting. 
At 3 years of age, both Logan and Sophia, had their first eye exam. Carolyn, who specializes in preschool children eye exam's, likes to examine them both again, in about 6 months. 
When she did the exam 6 months later, she was sure both children showed signs, that they might be myopic, and wants to examine them again in about 6 months.
Carolyn was right, and only being 4 years old, both children are wearing glasses now, I must say they are looking cute, and they both are very proud of their glasses, they now look just like mommy and aunt Carolyn. 
My mother was furious, and blamed us, we forced them to wear glasses, she does not like glasses wearing grand children, why did we make them wear glasses.


My mother could not believe her eyes, when she saw the ministers son again, he was wearing glasses, with the strongest lenses, she had ever seen.
His eyes looked very small, he sure did not look like the perfect male now.


Our love life, was as good as ever, and we both are proud parents.
When our children started school, their prescription was about -2.50, and went up every time they grew, and now going to high school are up in the -6.00 range, just like we had expected., Sofia's prescription is usually a 1/2 diopter higher then Logan's.


A few years later, during sex education, the children learned, about gay and lesbian people, and their life style.
Now they know that we are lesbian, and understand it, and realize they also have a gay uncle.
Logan, likes the girls, and he prefers them, when they wear glasses, and not to long after, brought Cindy home to meet us 
Cindy, is a very nice looking myopic girl, and when she is here visiting with us, feels right at home.
Sofia, has a boy friend, whose parents, are divorced, and he has no problem, with us being lesbian, he likes our close knit family atmosphere.
My mother now has lost her hate of eye glasses, she now wears glasses, and my older brother's children are wearing glasses, now she is very proud of all her glasses wearing grand children.


When , Sofia and Logan were ready for university, their prescription is now,
about - 12.00.
Logan wants to be a doctor, and Sofia a nurse.
We now think about our life, and are proud with what we have accomplished,
and to be accepted for who we are,
It all started, with a lesson about lenses and glasses, and a new girl coming into our class, and she wore glasses, that made me realize my vision was not perfect, my introduction to me wearing glasses.
