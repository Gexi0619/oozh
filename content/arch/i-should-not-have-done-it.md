,I should not have have done it ? 




I started to wear glasses for myopia, in grade 3.
At first I did not like wearing glasses, but after a few years, I had no other choice, because of 
the increases in my prescriptions , I slowly started to appreciate my glasses, because I can see perfect now, and I am not the only student wearing glasses anymore.


When I was in my third year of high school, my prescription was –7.50 and I was still growing, but I did not mind, I now love wearing glasses, and lately have lots of dates. 
I now realize that a girl who wears glasses, seems to get a guy turned on.


I had a lot of dates, with Peter, a glasses wearing guy, with a high myopic prescription, well build, and handsome, and I really liked him, but l lost track of him, after graduating.


I always had lots of friends, lots of dates and a great time.


When I went to college, I met Jim, a big strong athletic type of person. Jim did not wear
glasses, but he always told me, how he loves the looks, of women who wear glasses.
Jim and I are getting along well together, and we made plans, of what we were going to do after graduating., and decided that would be the right time to get married


We both started to work, after graduating, Jim was a representative for a chemical products firm, and sometimes does some travelling, to see his customers.
I work at the claims department, for an insurance company, I liked my work, I have learned so much, about medical problems, procedures and medications.


Both Jim and have good income, so we decided to buy a house, and start a family.
We now, have been trying, for a few years, to get me pregnant, but so far no luck.
I even bought, a new pair of glasses that he really likes, and Jim, loves it when I wear the glasses when we go to bed. 
We often wonder, why I don’t seem to be able to get pregnant.


I did some grocery shopping, on my way home to day, because I felt like treating myself, my husband is not home, he is out of town for business, and won’t be home till to morrow night.
I also, wanted to get some other items, so I can have a real good meal for him, when he gets home.


When I was in the store, browsing in the meat department, I noticed my old boyfriend Peter.
He saw me, and of course, asked me how I was doing, I told him , that I was married, and about the kind of work we did, and that I was looking for something really good to eat, for a special dinner.
Peter is in the meat business, and because they are promoting a new product, was the reason he was here.
He showed me the new packaging, and some fantastic looking steaks.
He asked me if I wanted to take some home, I sure do,,I love a good steak.
He tried to tell me, the best way to cook the steaks, when. I suggested, he come home with me and show me how.
I knew, I should not have done it, but I did.


After Peter showed me the perfect way, to cook the steaks, we sat down, to enjoy our food with a nice bottle of wine. 
We talked about glasses, and he mentioned that his prescription is – 21.00, I think he looks great wearing glasses. 
I mentioned that my prescription, is only – 9.50, and we talked some more, while we drank all the wine, and I don’t know how, but we ended up in my bed.


I sure felt very guilty the next day,

When my husband came home, I wore my bedroom glasses, and had a great meal ready, that we ate while we enjoyed, drinking some real nice wine. .
Not long after we were in bed.


About 6 weeks later, I did not feel very good after having my breakfast.
Because it happened more often, I checked with some of the girls at work,
They think, that I am pregnant.
I bought a test kit, which after using , showed me, that I was pregnant .,I am so happy
I cooked a fancy meal, and while eating, told my husband, that I was pregnant.
He is so excited, he is going to be a father.


The pregnancy, went well, and we are now the proud parents of a sweet little girl.
Courtney, grew fast, and we enjoyed looking at her nice blue eyes.


When Courtney was about 2 years old, and walking, we did notice her bumping into things, which surprised us, and we wondered why?. 
We talked to our doctor, who examined her, and then, suggested, she should have an eye exam.


Courtney, had her first eye exam, and was prescribed to wear - 3.50 . glasses.
Now that she walks, without falling, she likes her glasses so well, that she goes to bed wearing her glasses.


Every time, we took Courtney for an eye exam, her prescription went up., and when she started school, was wearing – 6.50 glasses.


I often wonder, why Courtney, would be so myopic, at such an early age, what prescription will she be wearing by the time she is 20 years old?


When I went, for my weekly shopping trip, for groceries, I met Peter again.
I had not seen him for a long time., I had Courtney with me, when we met him.
When I looked at Peter, I noticed the blue eyes, behind the strong lenses, and after having another good look, at his blue eyes, and facial features, I now realize who Courtney’s father is, and, because both Jim and I have brown eyes, I now know, where the high myopia comes from.


When Courtney finished high school, her prescription, was -17.50, with her beautiful head of hair, and nice facial features, she looks great, and is a well adjusted young woman, always busy, and has lots of dates. 


When Courtney, finished her final studies, her prescription was -21.00, she looks beautiful to us, and when I look at her blue eyes, behind the strong lenses, and the pleasure we have had, raising our only child, I am now glad I did it.!
