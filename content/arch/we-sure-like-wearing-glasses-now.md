We sure like wearing glasses, now.


My name is Amy, I consider myself an average looking girl, with a nice bust line, and am very proud of my dark blond hair.
After graduating from business college, and marrying my college sweetheart Tim, I started to work at a law office.
In the office I work with Mary, an older glasses wearing lady, and Ashley, a pretty looking girl about my age, I really enjoy my work.
Tim and I are saving our money, so we can afford to buy a house and start a family.
I like married life, after work at our evening meal, we talk about the day's happening, and always have great nights.
To night we went out to see a movie, and when we were waiting for the movie to start, I said to Tim, when we first started to date, and went to see a movie, we always sat in the last few rows, and now we take seats in the middle, why?
Well we found the picture quality, much better, when we are sitting closer to the front, I agreed and
we enjoyed the movie.


A few days later at work, Ashley was all smiles and so happy, she was going to have an eye exam.
Well, what is so exciting about an eye exam?
I am quite sure that after this exam, I will be told that I have to wear glasses.
You want to wear glasses? I remember a girl in high school, when she was told she had to wear glasses, tried to kill herself, what is so great having to wear glasses?
I am the only one in our family, who does not wear glasses, both my parents and my 3 sisters all wear glasses, and I envy my sisters, when they get new glasses, they get the latest styles, and blend them with their wardrobe, Amy, I love the looks of glasses.
I could not believe what I just heard.
Why would any one want to wear glasses.
That night I told Tim, about what Ashley had told me, his answer really surprised me, I have noticed quite a few, very nice looking glasses wearing girls, and I now know that some of the girls love wearing glasses, and feel they look nicer when wearing glasses.
I found all this out, when the girls at work, were talking during their lunch break
Tim knew all that, I found it hard to believe.


Saturday we went to the mall, to do some shopping, and when finished, we went to the food court to have some refreshments. 
While sitting there, and looking at all the shoppers walking by, I was surprised how many people, are wearing glasses now, and I had to agree with Tim, that many of them, looked very nice wearing glasses,
even glasses wearing school children, looked very cute wearing glasses.
I could not believe, that never before, had I noticed all that, I sure am sure not very observant.


Tim received a notice in the mail that it was time to renew his drivers license.
Well, he would do that some time during his lunch hour, and did not tell Amy, because it was not that important.


About a week later, when it was a rainy miserable day, we went to the mall to go and see a movie.
Since we were early, we went to the food court to kill some time.
When sitting there, a very smart looking, glasses wearing young lady, walked by, and said hi Tim.
Tim looked at her, sorry, I did not notice you right away, you look so different, and fantastic wearing glasses.
Tim, you are forgiven, I just picked up my new glasses, and I love my new look. 
When she had gone, Tim explained, that she was a girl who worked in the office, and never wore glasses before. 


The following Monday, when I came to work, Ashley was all smiles, and wearing glasses.
She looked fantastic, and I told her, how nice she looked.
Thank you, I am so happy to be wearing glasses now, and I just love them.
During the day, I looked at her quite a few times, and could not believe, how wearing glasses can make a person look so attractive.
I sure would like to try her glasses, to see what I would look like wearing glasses, but I don't think it is right, to ask a question like that.


That night, I told Tim about Ashley's glasses, and how nice she looked.
Tim, asked me if I had tried the glasses, to see what I would look like wearing them.
I don't think, it is proper to ask a question like that.
Well the girls at the office always like to try the other persons glasses.


A few days later when Ashley and I had our lunch together, and looking at Ashley, was thinking I sure would like to try her glasses.
When we were in the ladies room, before going back to work, I went over to the sink to wash my hands, Ashley was there checking her make up, she had taken her glasses off, and they were lying on the counter.
I looked at the glasses, and slowly got up the courage to ask her, if she would mind, if I tried her glasses.
Sure, go ahead.
I slowly put the glasses on, and then looked at myself in the mirror, what a surprise, I sure liked my glasses wearing look, my framed eyes looked nice and bright, and I found the glasses comfortable to wear, then I slowly looked around, and it seems that everything I looked at, seemed brighter and more defined.
Amy, you sure look good wearing glasses,.
Yes, I was surprised, how good I looked, but I also noticed an improvement in my vision, and wonder if that is my imagination.
Amy, all I can suggest, that you keep wearing the glasses, and when we are outside, you will find out, if wearing the glasses, improve you vision.
I am myopic, and have trouble seeing everything clear, that are further away, and I think you might have the same problem.
So I kept wearing the glasses, and when outside, walking back to the office, sure noticed a great improvement in my vision, I liked it so well, I did not want to give Ashley her glasses back. 
I now could see everything so nice and clear, and realize, I need to wear glasses.
When I told Ashley about it, she suggested, I should have an eye exam, and I agreed.
Realizing, that Tim, now seemed to like the looks of glasses wearing girls, I went ahead and made an appointment.
Now, I could not wait to find out for sure if I need to wear glasses, but I am pretty sure I do. 


The eye exam confirmed, what I had expected, and when I was told I needed to wear glasses, the doctor was surprised, that I had waited this long to have an eye exam.
When the optician looked at my prescription, told me she agreed with the doctor, and explained the prescription to me. OD. - 2.00, OS -1.75. and that she thinks I should have been wearing glasses before now.
Selecting a frame was so exciting, I wanted to make sure, that Tim would love my new look.
I was told that the glasses would be ready, the next day at noon, now, I could not wait, to get them.


Tim, remembered that he had to have an eye exam, so he asked one of the glasses wearing girls in the office, where she had her eye exam. 
She gave Tim the name and address, of where she went, and told him she liked the service there, so are you going to join us and wear glasses? 
I told her, that I had to have an eye exam, before I could renew my drivers license.
Well I am sure, you are going to look very handsome wearing glasses, I can't wait to see you.
So I made an appointment, and the next day left work early for the appointment, to have my eye exam.
After the exam was finished, I was told, like I had expected, that I should wear my glasses full time..
The optician, showed me some frames, that she was sure I would like, and she was right, I really liked them, and after a while, I decided on the frame I preferred, and was told my glasses would be ready tomorrow 
Now, I did not know, if I should tell Amy, or would surprise her, coming home tomorrow wearing glasses, and decided to surprise her.
After our meal, I mentioned to Amy, about one of the guys coming to work wearing glasses, and how handsome he looked,.
Yes I have noticed lately, that some men can look very cool wearing glasses, I like that look now.
Before I forget, I might be home a little later tomorrow.


The next day at noon, I picked up my glasses, loved my new look and could not believe the improvement in my vision.
Ashley and Mary, complimented me on how nice I looked, and Ashley wanted to try them, when she did, said, you sure needed to wear glasses, your prescription is quite a bit, stronger than mine.
Wearing the glasses, made me feel more confidant, and can't wait to go home, and see Tim's reaction, when he sees me wearing glasses.


When I came home, I put a pizza in the oven, and checked my make up, so I would look my best.
About 20 minutes later, Tim came home.
When I saw him walking into the room wearing glasses, and he saw me wearing glasses, we started to laugh, Amy what a nice surprise, to see you wearing glasses, you look beautiful, 
Tim, I never saw you look as handsome, as you do now, I love the way you look wearing glasses,
what a nice surprise.
While eating our pizza, we told each other our stories, and then had a very busy night.


The next time when we went to see a movie, sat near the back of the theatre again, and now know,
why lately we had sat near the front.
We sure like wearing glasses now., we like our new look, and can see perfect now.
