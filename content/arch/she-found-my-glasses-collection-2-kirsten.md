She found my glasses collection #2  (Kirsten)

Writing prompt 1
My blood froze instantly and I realized too late, that my secret would be revealed and I could not stop her anymore.
She had just opened the cabinet in my bedroom, which kept hidden, my huge selection, of prescription glasses, and my debatable testament, to my optical obsession.
There was no way I could get away, without telling her, I could only wait in dread and apprehension, for her reaction, 
I certainly was not prepared for my fiancee, to come waltzing into my bedroom, to see, if I am ready for our date.

Hello Kirsten, are you looking for something ?
No, I am just nosy, to see if you are neat and tidy.
Why don’t you check my dresser drawers, and in the cupboard, is where I keep my clothes.
You know, I am the jealous type, and wanted to see, if you have any pictures of other girls around.
As you can see I don’t.
What are all those eyeglasses, doing in your cabinet, are they all yours?
Yes, Kirsten, all those glasses are mine.
How come you always wear the same glasses, when you have a cupboard full, of other glasses?
Kirsten, all the glasses, in the cabinet, are my collection of glasses.
You collect glasses?
Yes, I do, I have worn glasses, since grade two, and I have kept them all, and some other people and family members have given me some,
when they do not need them anymore.
Collecting eyeglasses, are you nuts?
Well, you collect salt and pepper shakers, a lot of people, are collectors of some items, that we really like like. 
Is your glasses collection, valuable?
Perhaps, I never looked at it that way, what I know for sure is, that some of the glasses, could not be replaced.
I have one pair, which are more then a hundred years old.
I did not know, I am engaged to a glasses nut.
Do you have a glasses fetish?
I guess, so, I have always liked wearing glasses, and liked the looks of glasses.
Next thing, you will be wanting me, to wear glasses
No Kirsten, you are beautiful, and I do not expect you to wear glasses, when you do not need to wear them.
Well, that makes me feel better, I sure don’t like to be pushed, into something, I don’t need, or don’t want to do.
Well, Logan, at least, I now know about your fetish, and if it does not cost a great deal of money, or time,,have fun.
Let’s go and see that movie, I am looking forward to see, remember that film, we talked about.

When we entered the movie theater, Kirsten led the way, and selected our seats, closer to the front of the theater, then we usually do.
When we were watching the movie, I noticed Kirsten squinting. once and a while.
After a while she mentioned to me, that the picture, was not as clear and sharp as usual, I told her I had not noticed.
When the show was finished, Kirsten, told me she had a bit of a headache,
I have a feeling she might becoming myopic, being only in her early twenties,. 
I remember, at my last eye exam, the optometrist told me that a lot of women, in their early twenties, she has examined lately, are myopic. 
I now, know, Kirsten well enough now, not to mention anything, that she does not like to talk about.

We were married last weekend, and are having our honeymoon, at a nice sea resort, in a small historic town..
When we were window shopping, Kirsten noticed an antique store, that she would like to browse through.
Following her, between the displays, she stopped, Logan here is something for you, a box full of eyeglasses.
I could not believe my ears, I walked over, and sure there was the box.
Kirsten, patiently waited for me, while I checked out all the glasses, in the box.
I noticed, a real nice, drop temple pair of glasses, in a low prescription, in mint condition .
Logan, those glasses look so different, and nice, are you going to buy them, for your collection?
I like to buy, those glasses, but I want to find out the price first.
Then the guy, at the other end of the store, yelled to me, that the price of the glasses was $5.00 each.
Thank you Kirsten, these glasses are a real find, they were popular, in the late seventies, and eighties, and certainly are, in mint condition.
Now, I have another real nice pair of glasses.

When we came back to our hotel room, I had another good look at the glasses, not a scratch, on the lenses, which I am sure, are about --1.00. what a find !
I put the glasses in their case, and put them on the top of the dresser.

The fresh sea air, and feeling like relaxing, I stretched out on the bed, and fell asleep.

Kirsten was so happy for Logan, that he had found a pair of glasses for his collection, that he really liked.
What is so fascinating about eyeglasses, she wished she knew.
She noticed, the glasses case on the dresser, and took the glasses out of the case, and had a good look at them.
The glasses felt so delicate, and now, she could not resist to put the glasses on, to find out, what wearing glasses felt like.
The glasses, seemed to fit her perfectly, and wearing them, made her feel different, she liked the feeling of the glasses on her face.
Then she had a good look at herself in the mirror, and liked the way she looked, wearing the glasses.
Now she realized, why some people liked wearing glasses, they sure give you a new look.
Feeling like a different woman, decided to wake Logan, and see his reaction, to her wearing the glasses

I was awakened, when Kirsten asked me, are you going to get up?
When I opened my eyes, there was Kirsten, looking at me, wearing the drop temple glasses.
WOW! She looked great, that glasses wearing look, sure got me up in a hurry .
I sat down on the edge of the bed, but Kirsten, still wearing the glasses, told me to lay down, and we sure had some great sex, both of us, wearing glasses.

A little later, we dressed for dinner.
After Kirsten put her make up on, she surprised me, when she put the glasses back on.
Logan, I think, wearing these glasses, is fun, I like the look of them, and the lenses are like window panes, I have no problem, seeing perfectly, when wearing the glasses, do you mind if I wear them?
A woman, likes to look different, and be noticed.
Why would I object, if you like wearing the glasses, wear them.

We entered the dining room, and sat down, to look at the menu.
Next, a lady, came over to Kirsten, and told her how nice she looked wearing the glasses,.
Believe it or not, another lady came over, and complimented Kirsten, on how nice she looked, and would she mind telling her, where she bought those beautiful glasses.
I told the lady, that the glasses were a family, heirloom, and are not for sale.

Now, I understand, why you cannot put a value on your glasses collection, it is the buyer who would set the price, I am happy for you, that we found the glasses.

Kirsten wore the glasses once and a while, and mentioned, to me that she thinks she can see a little better, when wearing the glasses.

The honeymoon, is over, and we are now back to work.
The next day, Kirsten asked me if she could wear the glasses to work, all the girls wanted to see the glasses.

A few days later, I reminded Kirsten, that I had been to the license office, to change my address, and reminded her not to forget to get hers done..

Kirsten, came home, all upset, when she went to do her address change, they had told her it was time to renew her license, and she had to do the vision test, she did not pass the test, and was told to come back, when she was wearing glasses.
Can I borrow the glasses, from your collection?
I am sorry, Kirsten, what they mean, is you need to have, a proper eye exam.
You think, I need to wear glasses?
That is possible, we will have to wait and see.

Kirsten, had her eye exam, and was prescribed to wear glasses, as I had expected.
When looking at frames, in the optical store, she told me, she would like to have , two or three pair, I told her she could, but we should order the glasses on line.

At home, when Kirsten, had her picture on the screen, could not make up her mind, and I had to help her make the decision, on which frame ,would look best.
We placed the order, and now she cannot wait to get her new glasses.

She asked me to go through my collection, to see if I could find a pair of glasses for her, that she can use in the meantime.

I managed to find a couple of pairs , close to her prescription, for her to wear and satisfy her.
Now, the only time I see her not wearing glasses, is when we go to bed

When her glasses order arrived, she could not make up her mind, which pair to wear first.

When Kirsten, came home from work to night, told me all about how the girls she works with like her glasses, and how nice she looks, wearing glasses.
Logan, the best thing was, that I married you, a guy, with a glasses fetish, and now has a wife with a glasses fetish.
I never dreamed, I would love to wear glasses, but I sure do now, like wearing glasses.
