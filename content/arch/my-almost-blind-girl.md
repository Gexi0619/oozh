description: Moving to a new city for college, a student forms a surprising connection with his visually impaired housemate.
---
After I graduated from High School I wanted to continue with my education, so I enrolled at a University about 80 miles away from my hometown.  A friend of my dad lived in the city where the university was and he suggested that he had a neighbor lady who had just had her son join the armed forces so she was very amenable to renting out his room to a university student. Dad drove me down to check the place out and it seemed fine to me. I was going to be in a room on the third floor and there was a small bathroom up there as well as another vacant room. The rent was reasonable and I was getting my meals included. It was only a short walk to the nearest bus stop so dad rented the room and I was to move in 2 weeks later. The lady and her daughter had their rooms on the second floor and would not interfere with my privacy.
 
I moved in 2 weeks later and when I was called down for supper I walked into the kitchen to meet her daughter. My first impression was not good. She looked to be somewhere between 13 and 14, and she was ugly as could be, mostly because of the really thick glasses she wore. I had never seen a girl so young with glasses that were as thick as these were. They were really dished in on the front and the lenses gave off weird reflections. And even with the thick glasses the girl didn’t seem to be able to see very well, because when she was eating she brought her face very close to the plate so see what she was picking up with her fork to eat. I finished supper and headed back to my room to finish my book, but all I was thinking was that this was about the ugliest girl I had ever met and I hoped she didn’t think I would ever find her attractive.
 
The next morning I made my lunch and headed off to catch the bus. Today was an indoctrination day so I got back to the house early and went up to my room. I heard the front door open and the girl and her mom came in. There was a bit of loud conversation going on and I knew they didn’t realize I was home already. That young girl had a bit of a foul mouth on her because I heard her tell her mom she hated her fucking glasses and her god damned lousy eyesight. Eventually she ran up the stairs to her room, and I heard her crying in her room.
 
I waited a while before I went down to the kitchen for a glass of milk. Her mom was in there cooking supper, and she looked to have tears on her cheeks, but as she wiped them away she explained that she had just cut up some onions.  Maybe she did, but I suspected that the tears were likely about the argument that she and her daughter had been having.
 
That night at supper I took a closer look at her daughter Grace. I decided Grace wasn’t really ugly. She was, if you could get past the terribly thick and awful looking glasses, actually kind of pretty. She had a heart shaped face, and although her mouth was a little on the small side it was nicely shaped with full lips. She had a really decent breast size, and I couldn’t help but think to myself that Grace was so nearsighted that she likely couldn’t see past the end of her boobs. I had not really been sure what her vision problem was, but after giving her glasses a better look, and noticing how she got real close to everything to see I was positive that she was extremely nearsighted. It was unfortunate for her that the awful looking thick lenses in her glasses dominated her face or else she would be quite attractive.
 
“How was your day Devlin?” Mrs. Buckley asked.
 
I knew she was just trying to be polite, but I told her of going to register for all my classes and of meeting my professors. I mentioned that there was no one home when I got back, so I just went up to my room and had a nap. I didn’t want to tell them that I had heard Grace swearing at her mom so I just said that they must have come home while I was napping as I had not heard them.
 
“Grace and I had to go down to the pediatric ophthalmology department at University Hospital to have Grace’s 6 month eye checkup.” Mrs. Buckley said.
 
“Mom, do you have to tell everybody about my fucking eye problems!” Grace almost yelled at her mom as she got up from the table and ran off to her room.
 
“Grace is very sensitive about her vision problems. I wasn’t going to say anything more than just telling you where we went unless you asked.” Mrs. Buckley said.
 
“I have to admit that I am a little curious about why her glasses are so thick, but if she doesn’t want you to tell me that’s OK.” I replied.
 
“Well, you are living here, and her poor eyesight is like the elephant in the room. I would rather have Grace tell you herself, but she just hates to talk about the fact that she is legally blind without glasses and only has 20/100 visual acuity with correction. We saw the doctor today and he gave her a new, even stronger prescription that might get her to 20/70 or hopefully a little better, He had to give her bifocals so that he could give her a stronger distance prescription and that might allow her to see a little bit further than she can right now.” Mrs. Buckley told me. 
 
“Will her new glasses look any ………………
 
“Nicer?  No, not likely. The ones we ordered were very expensive because she needs the highest index glass lenses that are available. But for the bifocal she needs a little larger lens size than she would have gotten without them. Her new glasses have to have flat fronts because they can’t put bifocals in a concave front base. Her glasses have had to use biconcave lenses since she was around 5 or 6.” Mrs. Buckley told me.
 
“Has she always worn glasses?” I asked.
 
“She got her first glasses before she was 6 months old. When a baby is born they are quite nearsighted and as they develop they generally end up just a little bit farsighted. Grace never made the transition from being very nearsighted and had to get strong glasses for her myopia as a baby in order to have her eyesight develop at all. She just turned 16 on her birthday a couple of months ago and the doctor today said that he hoped that her severe myopia did not progress any further.” Mrs. Buckley said.
 
I was glad that Mrs. Buckley had told me what she had about Grace’s eyesight. Since I knew that she was very sensitive about her poor vision I could avoid the possibility of making a bad mistake. But it did make me feel very badly that Grace had these problems and that her vision was not, nor ever would be fully correctable. It was bad enough that she had to wear such terrible looking glasses without being able to see well with them on. I hoped that her new glasses would at least look a little bit better, even though her mom didn’t think they would.
 
A couple of weeks later I came home from school and I met Grace coming down the stairs just as I was about to go up. She had on what I took to be her new glasses and I could tell that her mom was right. Her new glasses looked to be every bit as awful looking as her old glasses had.  They were a little larger lens size for the frame, but instead of being heavily dished in on the front, the fronts were flat. The lenses looked to be pretty thick, but the area that held the prescription was likely about a 30mm circle. The bifocal line was easily visible on the front of the lens, and if you looked into her eyes through the power circle her eyes looked to be about a mile back from the lens.
 
“I see you got your new glasses Grace. They look nice. Do you think you can see a little better?” I asked.
 
“A bit better, but I still hate them.” Grace replied as she passed me.
 
That night at supper I couldn’t stop looking at Grace. She looked different for some reason. Her new, extremely strong glasses didn’t look any nicer, but for some reason they seemed to mesmerize me. This went on for the rest of the week, and I was almost glad I was going home for the weekend because I couldn’t stop staring at this very nearsighted young lady. When I got back Sunday night I managed to make it into my room without seeing Grace, and I was glad about that. I had thought about nothing else all weekend and all I wanted to do was to strip her naked except for her glasses and make love to her while looking into her myopic eyes through the thick lenses of her glasses.
 
By the end of the next week I had a lot of used tissues in my waste paper basket and they were not from blowing my nose. This was absolutely crazy. I was getting all horny over a young lady that was the next thing to being blind. And as shallow as I am I knew I would hate to be seen in public with Grace because everyone would laugh at me. Also, if I ever tried to take Grace home to meet my parents I could just imagine what my mother would say about my ugly blind girlfriend with the coke bottle bottom glasses.  This was crazy. Now I was imagining that I would ever take Grace home to meet my family.  Not a chance in Hell would that ever happen – at least not in this lifetime.
 
I was staying in the city for the weekend but I had no real plans. When I came down for breakfast Mrs. Buckley cornered me and asked me if I would walk with Grace to the grocery store and help her carry stuff home.  I couldn’t very well deny her this request as I had offered to help out whenever I could. That is why I was walking to the store with Grace. I tried to keep from staring at her and I think I did a reasonably good job. Fortunately I didn’t see anyone I knew, and while Grace did see a couple of girls from her school she merely said hi and we walked on. That was ok, because they didn’t know me and I would never see them again. 
 
At the grocery store I couldn’t help but watch Grace as she picked things off the shelves and read the ingredients. She would hold a can of soup about 4mm from the tip of her nose and would look through the bifocal portion of her lenses to read the ingredients. She did this time after time and I was getting hornier every minute. By the time we had finished our shopping I had a pretty good case of lover’s nuts and I could hardly wait until we got back home so I could relieve the pressure.
 
As we walked home we passed a movie theater. Grace read the different headings and said that she wanted to see one of the movies sometime. What an opening and of course I stepped right into it by saying that I wouldn’t mind seeing it as well. Before I knew what I was doing I told her we could go to see it tonight. Where is the nearest wall I can pound my dumb head against?
 
We had decided we would go to the 9pm show. It was dark when we were walking and Grace asked me if I would take her hand and guide her because her vision was worse in the dark. I didn’t know if that was just an excuse to get me to hold her hand or not, but I did do what she requested and it honestly didn’t feel that bad to be walking along holding hands.  Grace wanted to pay her own way into the show, but I insisted that I would pay to get in and she could buy any snacks we wanted. I didn’t really feel like anything but she got a thing of popcorn and a soda for herself. I let her choose her seat and we were in the lower section of the seating. It was closer than I would have chosen, but it wasn’t a problem. During the show she snuggled up to me and I had my arm around her. My hand accidentally brushed against her breast and she reached up and pulled my hand into her boob. I left it there and I liked what I was feeling.
 
We walked back home after the show and when we got inside the door Grace thanked me for taking her.  I don’t know why I did it, but I leaned down and kissed her. I was going to pull back after a light kiss, but she hugged me tight and tongued me in a French kiss. I went up to my room and released the tension for the second time that day.
 
It took me another month of dating Grace before her thick glasses became a non-issue. I don’t even know how to explain it. One day I just forgot about the fact that she was essentially blind without glasses. I still got horny when I looked at her, but now her glasses were not my focus. We spent the rest of that year together, and I took her to a couple of functions at the university, where I had to introduce Grace to some of my friends. Even after meeting Grace no one really said a thing about her obviously poor eyesight when I was around them. And Grace took me to some of her school functions. She didn’t seem to have a lot of friends, but I laughed when she told me the girl she considered her best friend asked her where she found a hunk like me, as I had never thought of myself as a hunk. 
 
I finished off my first year of university, and I got a job working in the city so I was able to stay around and date Grace all summer. My second year of university went much the same as my first year, but by now I was in love with my very nearsighted girl.  By the time I got to third year we were sleeping together and that was hard with her mom right there in the same house. Grace was a little bunny in bed, and she just loved the sex. By the time I graduated Grace had turned 19, and she was 3 months pregnant. We told her mom we were going to get married, and we went to City Hall to stand in front of a JP. Her mom went along and she was actually very happy that we had gotten hitched. My parents were presented with it after the fact, and as I had predicted my mom was quite upset that I had chosen to marry an almost blind girl. 
 
I am deeply in love with my now very pregnant Grace. When I first met her I had considered my almost blind girl to be the ugliest girl around, but now I can’t believe what a beautiful person she really is. I hardly ever think of the thick glasses she wears to see anything and I consider myself fortunate to have found her.
