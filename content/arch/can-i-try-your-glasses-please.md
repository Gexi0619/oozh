Hi! My name is Andy.
Ever since I can remember, I have loved the looks of glasses.
I don t know why I like glasses so much, I don t wear them, and nobody in our family does,
except my grandparents who wear glasses.
I am very jealous of anyone who wears glasses, why them and not me?
There are only 2 students in my class who wear glasses and they are very protective of them and nobody gets a chance to try them.

My birthday present was a new laptop computer, and I am having a great time on the internet.
Lots of information available on my favorite subject, glasses.
Now, I know how to tell if a person is near, or farsighted because of the difference in the lenses.
I can t wait until I get a chance to try someones glasses to see what it is like to look trough those lenses
and find out what you see, and what it feels like to wear glasses. 

The summer holidays are almost over, and I got a real surprise when Jeff one of my friends, came to see me was wearing glasses.
Jeff looks fantastic wearing glasses, and I noticed when I looked at the lenses of his glasses, that he is myopic.
After complimenting him on his new look, asked him if I could try his glasses.
What a thrill it was,  when he handed me his glasses and I put them on.
I was wearing real glasses and was fascinated how different everything now looked.
A little fuzzy, and everything I looked at,  looked a little smaller but more defined.
I loved the feel of the glasses on my face, and was fascinated when looking through the lenses.
Now I am sure, that I want to wear glasses.
Hesitantly I gave Jeff his glasses back, when he asked for them.
Jeff, how do you like wearing glasses?
Well, I don t like it, but I have no choice if I want to see properly.

I loved my first time experience trying glasses, I sure like to try some more.
One day on the way to school, I met Katie who is in my class, I noticed she seemed upset.
I asked her what her problem was.
She told me she has to wear glasses and does not want to wear them.
Let me see your glasses, I like to see them.
Katie dug in her school bag and handed me a glasses case.
I opened them up and took out a beautiful looking pair of glasses with myopic lenses.
These glasses are beautiful, can I try your glasses?
Yes, go ahead.
I put the glasses on and had the same exciting experience when I tried Jeff s glasses.
You should be able to see everything perfect wearing theses glasses.
Yes they improve my vision, but I don t like how I look wearing them.
Here put your glasses on and let me have a look.
Katie put her glasses on and looked at me, well don t I look awful?
No, I think you look fantastic, your eyes look so nice behind the lenses, and the frame looks very nice on you.
I bet you a good many people would love to look as good as you do wearing glasses.
Thank you, you make me feel better about having to wear glasses.

I now have a part time job at our grocery store, most of the time I have to do the packing of the customers bags at the check outs.
Looking at all the people that I serve is an enjoyable job 
There are so many people wearing glasses now for me to look at, and sometimes I even get a chance to talk to them about their glasses and give them a compliment. 
I always wish I could try some of their glasses, but no such luck.
Really I am very lucky, I have a job and make some extra pocket money, and have an opportunity to enjoy the looks of all those glasses wearing people.
To day I was almost in a trance when I looked at a women wearing the strongest myopic lenses I had ever seen.
Young man are you staring at me?
I told her I was sorry, when I saw the lenses on your glasses, I had to have a second look, they fascinated me, you look beautiful, sorry again for staring.
She told me it was all right, these are my new â€“ 14.00 glasses, and I have noticed myself the special look of the lenses, thank you for your compliment, have a nice day.


I want to wear glasses so badly that I do everything they mentioned on the computer to ruin my eyesight, I hope it works.
Would it not be nice if I could order a pair of glasses on line, but I have no prescription for them to fill out an order..
I now wonder how to get hold of a prescription that would be useful.
The opportunity came sooner than I expected.
When I went to Jeff s place, he showed me his new glasses, he had an eye exam and told me his prescription went up a little.
After I tried the glasses, which were a little to strong for me, I tried his old glasses and when wearing them could see quit well. 
I asked him if he had any of the prescriptions.
He told me he even had his old prescription, and showed me both of them.
When I looked at them noticed that his prescription had gone up from -1.00 to- 1.50.
On his printer I made a copy of both prescriptions.
He asked me why I wanted the copies of his prescriptions.
So I told him I wanted to wear glasses, and was going to order a pair on line.
If you want glasses that bad, I let you borrow my old ones.
I thanked him put the glasses on and felt on top of the world, I have glasses now.
I wore the glasses as often as I could, and it did not take very long for my vision to be almost perfect wearing the glasses.
I even wore the glasses to work one day, and received many comments. 

I liked to go out and see a movie on Saturday nights, and always try to have a date with a girl who wears glasses.
Since I have Jeff s old glasses now, I put them on just before the movie start.
I always love it when the girl says, I did not know you wore glasses.
Now the glasses conversation starts and I always get a chance to wear my dates glasses.
So exciting, so much fun trying all the different prescriptions.
I always seem to be able to spot any student who starts to wear glasses, and I always enjoy the glasses conversation and of course trying the glasses.

 Wearing Jeff s glasses as much as I could must have effected my vision. 
I have no trouble seeing when trying some of the other students glasses.
Realizing my distance vision is not as good as it was, and now being sure I will be prescribed glasses,   decided to tell my mother that I thought I needed an eye exam.
She was very surprised to hear that, but told me she would make an appointment.

When I went for my eye exam, I knew what to expect.
Having studied the procedures I really enjoyed the experience.
When the doctor started to ask which is better 1 or 2, I knew I would be prescribed glasses.
Now I could not wait to see my prescription, me wearing glasses at last.
When the doctor had finished the exam told me I should wear glasses, and handed me my prescription.
It read right eye -1.00, left eye -1.25 and a little astigmatism.
Now the exciting part, finding the right frame, the optician was very helpful.
When the glasses were ready and I put them on, I looked at a whole new world,
everything I looked at was clear and well defined, fantastic.
I loved my new look, what a beautiful day, at last I got my wish, wearing glasses.

After graduating from high school, I started a new job,
At the place where I work is a large staff lunchroom.
I soon got in the habit to sit, and have lunch at a table with somebody who wore glasses.
It is very easy to get the conversation started on my favorite subject, glasses.
My favorite line, can I try your glasses works most of the time. 
I just love trying all those glasses and looking trough all the different prescription lenses.
What a thrill.

I started going out with a very attractive girl.
Carol has a very pleasant personality, beautiful hair and of course wears glasses.
Her prescription she told me is now -4.25 on the right eye, and -4.75 on the left eye.
It was not until my third date, that I got a chance to try her glasses.
What an experience that was, I loved the strong lenses, what an exciting feeling.
I tried to talk her into giving me a pair of her old glasses, but no luck.
A little while later she told me she had an appointment for an eye exam.
I was all excited she most likely get an increase in her prescription, and I might get a chance to try her stronger myopic lenses. 

At our next date, about a week after Carol s eye exam, I was looking forward to see her new stronger glasses, and a chance to try them.
After I rang the doorbell, Carol opened the door.
I could not believe my eyes, she was not wearing her glasses.
I asked her what happened to her glasses?
Surprise, I had LASIK and don t have to wear glasses anymore.
Don t you like my new look?
When I told her I thought she looked better wearing glasses, she told me I could go home.

Now I have a lot of dates again with girls who wear glasses, so I can ask can I try your glasses.
It is always exciting and I am sure that some day I will find the right girl, and when I ask her can I wear your glasses, she will tell me anytime you want.
So for now I will be satisfied with can I try your glasses, and wait for the answer,
anytime you want.
