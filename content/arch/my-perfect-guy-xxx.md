description: Alexia and her best friend Nikki's friendship is tested when Nikki falls for Alexia's brother.

Hello, this story has sexual content. I would love some feedback on it, excuse me if the grammar isn't perfect I'm not an English native. Hope you Enjoy! 

........................................................................................................................................................................................



Alexia and I have been best friends since High School, now we are both mixing part time jobs with the last college courses and our friendship has been getting stronger and stronger. It’s the friendship movies try to portrait, where everyone in your family knows your friend and viceversa and you can come to their house anytime… That’s the kind of friends we are. 

I work in a music store, we sell instruments, accessories and all that stuff musicians need, and Alex brother has been a regular customer since he started playing the drums two years ago, and I think he wants to learn other instruments cause he came last week to buy a pack of strings. He is such a funny guy, charming is the word I’d use to describe him.

Today Alex and I went out for a coffee in our favorite coffee house near our neighborhood, and she told me Mike (her brother) is really into me; I was so surprised, I never thought he would actually consider me to be “dateable”, I mean I’m not ugly or anything, I’m 5, 4’, fair skinned, my hair is super thick, long and has a weird natural color between blond and red, and in terms of body I can’t complain, my figure developed well when I was 19. 
But to me he has always been the perfect guy, I think he may be 6 feet tall, he kind of is one of those strong “can pick you up with an arm” guy, he has that perfect smile you only see in movie actors… My dream guy! He is smart, funny, a true gentleman, but I thought he was waaaaay out of my league…

Alex: - Girl, I’m telling ya, he is so into you he makes up excuses to go to the music store just to talk to you a few minutes
Nikki: - Really? He came to pick up some guitar strings, I think you are seeing a sea where there’s no water…
Alex: - Dude, have you ever seen a guitar in my house?

….. Then it hit me….

Man was I exited! How else could I be? How would you be if your perfect guy appears right in front of you and you knew he likes you too? And I was gonna have the chance to be with him next Saturday because their cousin is getting married and I was invited too, I asume I’m going to be sitting in the same table as they are, so I hope I’ll get to be next to him.

————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Saturday came faster than I knew, today I’m wearing high heels, a long dark purple dress and to be honest, I do look good. This kind of dress suits me because it’s so tight it shows my breasts and my well formed rear part…

I’m so nervous to see him, but I’m managing  good. The ceremony is short and I thank God for that because I want him to dance with me all night long. 

N: Do you wanna dance?
M: Sure Nikki, it would be my pleasure

WHAT’S GOING ON? Why am I feeling like this? His perfect smile, his amazing hair, his big hands in my small waist…. everything is perfect tonight.

Mike: Nikki, I’m gonna spend the night at my friends house, wanna come?
-To be honest, I thought we would be alone tonight, but being with him was what I wanted so I was gonna go wherever he wanted to-
Nikki: Would you want me to come? 
Mike: I would love to, he is out of town and he asked me to feed his dogs
-WHAAAAAAT? Am I lucky or what?!


We said goodbye to everybody and left the wedding holding hands. He opened the car door for me and I got in, and when he was about to close the door, he kissed me. A rush of emotions came to me. If you are a guy I don’t know how you feel “down there” when something like this happens, but when you are a girl, you feel something very weird, hard to describe, I would say is like a super tiny mini orgasm, but man does it feel amazing! 

He was driving towards his friend house when he said:

Mike: Sorry Nikki, I had to leave because my contacts are killing me, and the smoke machine only made things worse
Nikki: Don’t worry Mike, is there anything I can do to help you? (And I must admit I didn’t know he wore contacts, Alexia wears rather thick glasses, she told me her prescription is -9 and -12 but I don’t know what that means, I only know I can’t see anything with her glasses and she says she is blind without them)

Mike: I’m afraid the only thing you can do is promise you won’t freak out if you see me wearing glasses
Nikki: What do you mean “if”, aren’t we going to your friends house so you can take off your contacts?
Mike: Yes, we are, but I’m afraid that you would see me wearing glasses and you won’t like me anymore. Because you do like me right? 
Nikki: That’s nonsense Mike, I do like you, A LOT! And you’ve always been my crush, so what makes you think a pair of glasses are gonna stop me from liking you even more?
 Mike: These are not any pair of glasses, they are supe thick, believe me. And Im so insecure about them and my eyesight problems, with contacts I’m ok, but I can’t see as good with glasses as I do with my contacts 
Nikki: Just drive, when we get there you’ll switch from contacts to glasses and I’ll give you the biggest kiss to prove you I don’t mind


And he did, he drove silently to his friends house, and as soon as we enter, he head to the bathroom with a bag and I checked on the dogs, that had a lot of dog food left, so I only poured clean water in their water plates and sat down on the couch.
10 minutes passed by and he was still in the bathroom

N: Mike? Are you ok?
M: Wait a minute Nikki, why don’t you go to bed and I’ll be right with you in a few minutes?
N: Seriously? I do like you Mike, but you have to show me the real you

And I heard how the bathroom door opened up slowly, and my perfect guy came out wearing glasses I only saw in tv shows as fictional props.

M: See, this is me. Blind Mike, Blinde Mice, Blind guy… I hate these things- he said as he took off his glasses and sat on the couch. With his glasses on his hand and his eyes trying to look at me I realized he really can’t see anything without them. His look was lost, his right eye turned inwards and he was focusing on nothing but pretended to be looking at me. 
N: Come on Mike, wear them. They are a part of who you are and I like you, I really really like you
M: Seriously? Do you like me even with this thick ass coke bottles on? -He had his glasses on his lap now-
-I went to his couch and sat on his lap grabbing his glasses, I was a little bit shocked because I realized he wasn’t aware of me heading towards him until I grabbed his glasses. I kissed him hard, like I’ve never kissed before. I felt his tongue and that feeling I described above came again, I was so aroused I had to contain myself. I kiss him on the eyes and put his glasses on
N: Here, you look good with them and I bet I look better when you wear them too (he looked weird but not bad, I was just so used to seeing him bareyed)
M: You are amazing Nikki -He said that and kissed me hard, harder than before, and suddenly his right hand was caressing my breasts. I said I contained myself, but that was only for a few minutes, now I was lost in his amazing roughness, mixed with his sweetness and the fact that this perfect guy was so dependent on something so little like a pair of glasses.

I rubbed his pants and felt how he got hard. I unbuttoned his shirt, and proceded to unzip his pants, he told me to turn around and he pulled my dress zipper down. I was now in my underwear and he was taking off his pants. 
I started to kiss his chest and worked my way down, and when I had his hard penas on my mouth I turned my head up and saw him taking his glasses off. 
I could see him looking at me but his eyes look unfocused, he wasn’t seeing anything. I came up and asked him to go into me and so he did, he was about 5 inches from my boobs and he couldn’t see them or at least that’s what I think because he touched me and worked his way to my nipple that way. 
It felt so good to have him in me, he was such a good lover…
We switch positions and I asked him to wear his glasses, he said he couldn’t see them so I handed them off  to him, he didn’t say anything but wore them. 
I could see him getting so much more exited and I noticed he was about to come and when we were higher, I took them off. I don’t know why, but I just did it and it aroused me even more. 
We kissed each other for about half an hour after that and I took his glasses and his hand and headed to the bed. We slept hugging each other.

…. To be continue…
