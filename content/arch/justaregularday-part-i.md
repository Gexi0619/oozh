description: A wealthy guy confronts a girl angry with his Instagram posts, leading to an eye-opening revelation.
---
I have been lucky enough to grow up in a wealthy family, but I didn’t know I was wealthy cause I thought everyone lived the way they wanted, not the way they could.
One day I went into my instagram account and I saw that a girl had left a comment on my latest post and it read “Filthy rich people like this, make me sick”. 

Filthy rich?, why was she mad?... I was only posting a normal picture of me in a restaurant I often go to.  

I clicked on her name to see if it was someone I knew but there were only pictures of places, things and soccer teams.
So I decided it was a good idea to DM her…
“Hey, I saw your comment on my last post. I would like to know, why are you mad? I have done nothing to upset you and if I did I’d love to know what it was to be more careful next time” I wrote
Days went by and I could see her name on my stories, which meant she had been online, but I still had no response on the DM. 

“Hey, are you there? I can see you watch my stories, I’d like you to answer to me” I repeated. I don’t know why I cared so much about her comment. I really wanted to know why she was so rude. 

“Hi dude, nothing special. It’s just that I’m sick of seeing filthy rich ass kids like you having everything. It’s unfair some of us have to bust our asses off and still we have nothing.” She answered almost immediately after my last DM
“Wow, you don’t even know me girl, you shouldn’t be judging me that much I’m actually a nice guy.” I replied 
“That’s what everyone says. You’re always nice guys with a nice heart… BS!” She wrote
“WTF is your problem? I did nothing, I don’t owe you anything and you shouldn’t be such a bitch. I was having a good time and I’m free to post anything I want to” I said
“You are right Nikki, you’re entitled to post anything” she wrote
“My name is Nicolas, not nikki, and I don’t know why you are this mad. I haven’t done anything to offend you” I wrote back
“Nothing to offend me? It offends me that you’re eating wings with actual gold and drinking Don Perignon champagne and you use the hashtag #JustARegularDay. Like are you mocking us or what?” She replied 
“Ok, first of all those wings aren’t mine, second of all why should I explain to you my hashtags? And third of all who do YOU think you are to tell me what I can and can’t post?” I replied
“I’m one of the people who actually sees the #JustARegularDay campaing as something serious. To me it means something” She wrote
“Wtf are you talking about? Which campaign?” I said
“What? You’re using that hashtag and you don’t even know or are you playing dumb?” She wrote
“I really don’t know what you’re talking about, please tell me” I texted
And I waited for her response all day long but that was all I got, so the next day I tried again…

“Hey, you never wrote me back. Hello?” 
But again, no answer.
Two days later a DM caught my attention; I opened Instagram and saw she had actually sent me DM
“If you want to chat some more, here’s my phone number. My name is Grace, I’m on What’sApp” 
So I saved her number and sent her a what’sapp message:

N: “Grace, I’m Nicolas from Instagram. We still have issues to discuss” I said
G: “Hi Richie Rich, I see you waste no time. Why are you so hooked again?” she wrote
N: “Because I’m a nice guy, I do charity, I try to be humble, I don’t mess with people, I don’t see why you are messing with me” I texted
G: “I’m not messing with you. I’m just sick of life being so unfair” She replied
N: “Unfair? Why do you keep saying that?” 
G: “Because I was going through the posts of the hasthag #JuastARegularDay and suddenly I see your stupid post. That’s not regular, that’s a mockery of what we’re trying to achieve”

N: But what do you mean? I honestly never meant to offend anyone!”

G: “Ummm are you being absolutely honest?” she wrote
N: “I am, I swear!” I replied

G: “Ok, then click on the #JARD and see what’s about. Text me when you do” 

I was intrigued about what she meant so I went to Instagram and searched the hashtag.
A bunch of images of people with white canes, thick glasses, crossed eyes, hearing aids, crutches, wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs appeared. 
I clicked on one to understand what it was about and I realized it was about disabled people living life and telling their stories and struggles for “abled” people to understand what it was like. 
I felt so bad, I could see why she thought I was mocking them.
N: “Grace, I’m so so sorry I didn’t know what that hashtag was about. I thought it was just a regular hashtag” I texted
G: “Are you sure you didn’t know?” 

N: “I swear, I’m a nice guy I actually have social anxiety and depression, I wouldn’t dare to be such a douche with anyone” I wrote 

G: “Why would someone like you have social anxiety or depression? You have everything!” 
N: “Having money is not having everything. Can I ask you something?”

G: “Shure, go ahead” “It might not be everything but I’m sure it helps a lot” She wrote
N: “Why do you keep saying that hashtag is also yours? Do you have a disability? I’m not trying to be disrespectful or anything it’s a genuine doubt” 
G:  “I’m not offended, don’t worry. I actually don’t fall into the disabled category just yet. But I do have severe eye issues” She wrote
N: “Ohh, is it ok if I ask what kind of issues?” 
G: “Uhmm I guess so, I have something called strabismus and I’m severely longsighted. I need to use very thick glasses in order for me to be able to see, but I also depend on the illumination of the place. I’m very sensitive to light but dim light doesn’t help either.” 
N: “Ohh I’m sorry to read that. I have a friend who uses thick glasses. He said he needs a minus three and always says he struggles to see the ball when we play football” I texted
G: “Hahahah not to diminish your friends eye issues, but I wish I had that prescription. I’m a +12 on the right eye, +14 on the left one. My script is a little bit more complicated cause I also have some astigmatism and another things to make my eyes as straight as possible and bifocals” She replied
N: “I don’t think I have seen glasses like that. Do you think we could facetime? I’d like to know my new friend J” 
G: “Uhmmm I don’t know, I’m so self-conscious about how thick and ugly my glasses are I try to be as away of cameras as I can”
N: “There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Your hashtag encourages people to be real. So be real Grace, I’m a nice guy” I said and I sent her a picture of me with my thumb up and smiling
G: “Oh wow, you are good looking Nicolas.” She replied “What the heck? We don’t even live near so there you have it” She said and attached a picture
She was a normal girl, kind of pretty you could say, but her green eyes looked gigantic and crossed, I could see a bulge on the middle of the glasses. 

N: “Nice to meet you Grace, you are a nice looking girl too. Can I ask what’s that in the middle of your glasses?” I texted
G: “Lol, you can be honest Nicolas, I won’t judge you. That’s what holds my glasses together. I had to tape them. My insurance doesn’t cover my glasses so I have to wait a little longer to get new ones.” She texted
N: “It doesn’t? But why do you have to wait? Are they expensive?” I asked
G: “Very and I don’t even ask for high indexes anymore. I think by the end of this year I’ll have enough money to buy new glasses” 

BY THE END OF THIS YEAR?! We are in january, that’s 11 months!!! 

N: “Omg! How much do they cost?” I asked
G: “Hey, I’m not asking you for money I can work and pay my own glasses. It is rude that you think I can be part of your charity” she texted
N: “No, Grace I don’t mean it like that” I had to make things better “A friend of mine actually owns some labs across the country. Where do you live?” I asked 
G: “In Utah, you?” 
I searched for labs in utah and found Wolcott Optical. I made a call and I actually was lucky enough to talk to a very polite lady. I explained to her that I had a friend who needed new glasses but couldn’t afford them and that I wanted to help her by paying, but she had to think that they were interested into making free glasses for her but I didn’t know how to make her believe me. 
She said she could tell her they were trying new techniques and that the first lenses they used were for free. She gave me the bank account to make the deposit and we were set. 
G: “Nicolas?” 
N: “I’m sorry I was taking a shower. I live in Manhattan currently, but I was born in Italy. My friend actually has a lab in Utah. He is trying new techniques and since they need people to try their new lenses and stuff they give the glasses in exchange of people making a review. If you’re interested I can tell you where to go” I wrote
G: “Uhmm I think I have heard of that actually. But I don’t know if I’m eligible for having such strong prescription.”
N: “Ohh but that’s what he wants. He wants to try the hard ones.” I said and clearly I had no idea what I was talking about. 
G: “Ok, I have nothing to lose. Where do I go?” 
N: “Wolcott Optical Services, LC 3145 UT 84106. Say Nicolas Schmidt sent you and the receptionist will know what’s about. It’s  Dr Millcreek” 
G: “Ok, thank you Nicolas Schmidt. You do seem to be a nice guy after all…”


My sister was getting married in France in a month and she asked me to help her with some things so I had to travel a few days to Europe. I was in the JFK airport listening to my favorite podcast when I thought it’d be a good idea to buy a coffee before getting into my plane. Everything was good but suddenly my Airpods disconnected… “What the hell?” I thought and then I realized I had left my phone in my seat and someone took it! I tried asking the people around but it was useless. There was no time left for me to go out and buy a new one so I had to take my flight phoneless. 

Funny how we’ve become so dependent on technology, just as disabled people are dependent on their glasses, crutches, etc…
I always get jetlag so I had to go to sleep right away. Almost a day and a half had passed when I went to buy a new iPhone and it took me a while to get my apps back. 
N: “Hey Grace, I’m Nicolas. I lost my phone and I just bought one. How’s everything going?” I asked
G: “Hey Nick! I’m so glad to get your message. I called Dr. Millcreek as soon as you told me and I got an appointment right away! I was there yesterday and the lady assistant told me my case is exactly what they’re looking for!! They did a very professional eye exam and I’m getting new glasses in a couple of weeks!!!”
Nick? Someone was in a good mood…
N: “Great Grace!! I’m glad to know that. Maybe when you get your new glasses you will be a little more confident to post pictures” I texted
G: “I don’t think so, but we’ll see… My Rx. Reads 
+12.50 / -2.50 130axis / 8 BO ADD +2
+14.50 / -4.00 80axis / 8 BO ADD +2 
So even with the high index the lady told me they’d try on my glasses, I bet they’re gonna be super thick” 
N: “Don’t worry I bet they will be ok. Tell me a little bit about you” I texted back not knowing this was the start of a really good friendship.
I had been in France for 8 days now and it was time to get back to the US, so I thought It’d be a great idea to go and surprise Grace and show her I’m actually a nice guy. 
N: “Gracey, are you there?” I texted
G: “Yup Nikko, what’s up?” She replied right away
N: “I’m on the airport right now about to buy my ticket back home but I was thinking… What are you gonna do tomorrow?” I wrote
G: “Why? Are you planning on coming to Utah?” She wrote
N: “Well, I haven’t been there in a while. I thought maybe we could have a coffee and discuss about the show you recommended me… such a bad choice” I said
G: “Are you for real? Why would you want to come to Utah? Why would you wanna know me?” 
N: “Well, we’re friends aren’t we? Friends know each other. But if you want to that’s ok” 
G: “It’s not that I don’t want to Nick, it’s complicated… I feel very insecure and I don’t think you will actually like me. I don’t think we’re on the same page cause I’ve been feeling things for you for a few days now. You’re the nicest guy I’ve talked to, but I know I’m never going to be the girl you want to date. It’s ok, but I don’t think I’m ready to meet you yet” She wrote
I have never thought of dating someone in the distance, but I could fly whenever I wanted or I could even rent an apartment in Utah if I wanted to. See, it’s the thing about money: When you have it, there’s almost no problem that can’t be solved. I had never seen Grace’s eyesight as impairment for us to date, but I didn’t know her, I had to know her and see if I liked her. 
N: “Grace if it’s ok with you, I’d like to take you out on a date and see how we both feel. I could be there tomorrow and pick you up about 8pm if that’s ok?” I said and I think she must’ve been exited because she accepted. 
I bought my ticket to Chicago and then I was going to Utah to meet Grace. I had to be prepared so I googled “Dating a visually impaired girl” and a few sites had information about dating fully blind people, not partially sighted. I didn’t know how much Grace could see so my sister gave me the advice of going to that date as I would to any other date, and if there was something I needed to know maybe Grace could teach me, and I thought it was a great advice. 

Tomorrow I’m meeting Grace, and I’m feeling a little bit excited!!...

PART II COMING UP TOMORROW
