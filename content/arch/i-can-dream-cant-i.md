I can dream, can’t I ?


After sitting at the computer all night, and enjoying looking at girls wearing glasses, and reading stories about their reactions, and loving every minute of it, I went to bed, and it was not long before I fell into a deep sleep.
---------------------------------------




Hi, my name is Emily, I have an older brother Harry.
Both my parents wear glasses, and Harry started to wear glasses when he started going to school.
I like to wear glasses to, they look so nice, Perhaps I will get glasses when I am ready to go to school.
After the summer, I will be old enough to go to school.
My parents sell eyeglasses from their store, which is in the front part of our house.
Sometimes I get a chance to get into the store, and get a chance to play with some of the glasses 
that are on display, it is so much fun to try the glasses on, and see what I look like wearing glasses.
I like playing with the glasses, but I guess I am not old enough to wear glasses yet.


My brother Harry, told me to day, he will be getting new glasses, when I asked him how he knew, he told me, that Dad is a doctor, who examines peoples eyes, and he can tell, if you need to wear glasses, he examined my eyes to day, and told me I need stronger glasses, and that he is going to examine your eyes to morrow.
Now I am all excited, I am to get an eye exam.
I think I had an eye exam before, but I cannot remember how the exam went, perhaps I am now old enough to get to wear glasses, just like Harry and mom and dad.


The next day, dad asked me to come into the store, he told me he wanted to examine my eyes.
After looking into some boxes, where I looked at a picture, and then I got a puff of air blown into my eyes, my dad, asked me to sit in the big chair, and he looked into my eyes with a bright lite.
Then he put, what looked like over size glasses on my face, and I had to read the letters on the wall.
I liked this part best, when you could not see the letter clearly, I heard a click or two and the letter looked nice and clear.
After he was finished, and told me to see my mother, to help me pick out a nice frame, for my new glasses.
So I am going to wear glasses now, wonderful.
My mother let me decide which frame I wanted for my glasses, and then took some measurements.


The next day, my mother adjusted my new glasses, and I loved it when I looked around and everything I looked at was so nice and clear.
When I saw what I looked like wearing the glasses, was so happy, that I looked so nice wearing glasses.


I was very proud of my looks, when I started going to school, there were only three other kids in my class wearing glasses.
About six moths later, when my dad examined my eyes, he said, just like I expected you have a big 
increase in your prescription, I am worried, if you keep going like this you will be a high myopic,
right now you will need new glasses.
I loved my new glasses, and I sure could see much better now.
My brother commented on my glasses,, and when he tried mine, and I tried his, we both realized 
our prescriptions were about the same.
I now had regular eye exams, every six months, and after each exam, I started to wear new glasses, with a stronger prescription.
When I went to high school, my prescription read, right eye -7.75 , and left eye – 8.25
I am sure proud of my nice new stylish glasses, and with my beautiful hair, and nicely developing figure, had a lot of guys looking at me.
Some of the girls were jealous of me, they had trouble figuring out why a girl with strong glasses, was so popular with the boys.


The following year, with an another increase in my prescription, increased my confidence as well.
I did well in school, had high marks, and participated in many different clubs, and had lots of friends.
Some nights and on weekends, I worked for my dad in his optical business.
I liked nothing better, than helping first time glasses wearers, select a new frame, and telling them 
about the benefits of wearing glasses, to give them confidence wearing their new glasses.


My prescription, was -12.50 for the right and -13.25, for the left eye, by the time I finished my studies to become an optician.
I am so proud of my beautiful glasses, and my fiance loves them.
I now work full time, and love my ........

I tried to see what time it is, but everything looks fuzzy, so I put my glasses on to see the time, 4.30 in the morning, I turned over and tried very hard to continue that wonderful dream
