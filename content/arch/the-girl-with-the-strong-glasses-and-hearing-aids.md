The girl with the strong glasses. and hearing aids.


Emily, our youngest child, is acting differently at her age, than her older brother and sister.
During a visit with our doctor, we told her our concerns, she suggested, Emily might have a vision problem, and made an appointment for us with a pediatric optometrist for an eye exam.
After a lengthy and thorough exam, the doctor told us that Emily is myopic and should wear glasses.
The prescription for her right eye is -2.75, and her left eye -3.00.
We were shocked, poor little kid, at her age wearing glasses.
In the optical store we selected a frame, that Emily liked, and we think will look cute on her.
When the glasses were ready, and Emily started to wear the glasses, she was like any normal girl her age, she did not want me to take her glasses off when she went to bed, and I had to wait till she fell asleep before I could take them off.

We now made sure we had the vision checked on Ashley and Logan, but their vision was normal.
I had never heard about myopia, and now understand a little of what it is, and that Emily will be wearing glasses, for the rest of her life.
Where does it come from, I cannot think of anybody in our whole family who is myopic.

Poor Emily, besides wearing glasses, she also has enough hearing loss, that now she has to wear hearing aids, she wears them all the time, and told us she can hear everything so much better, and does not mind wearing them.

Emily is going to pre. school now, and her glasses prescription went up, and is now -3.25 for the right, and -3.50 for the left eye.
Since she is the only child in her class wearing glasses, she is known as the girl with the glasses and the hearing aid
Emily is very proud of her glasses, and wears them all the time.
When Emily went into grade one, her prescription had increased another 1/2 diopter.
There are 3 children in her class who wear glasses, but she is the only one with glasses for myopia.
The following years more children started to wear glasses for myopia, and now Emily is the girl with the strong glasses, and the hearing aid.
Emily's myopia increased at about 1/2 diopter a year, and when she went to high school, her prescription read OD -6.75, and OD -7.00.
During her first year in high school when Emily, grew some more, and started to look like a young lady, her prescription, went up another 1.1/2 diopters.

Emily's story

For my 15'th. birthday, the best gift, I received was a course in self improvement and modelling.
I am very interested in fashion, and like to draw models, wearing glasses and special clothing.
I sew and make some of my own clothing, and I like to look my best all the time.
The course would teach me proper walking, how to properly use make up, and how to look like a lady.
Every time that somebody suggest I should wear contact lenses, I tell them I like my glasses, and like the way I look wearing glasses.
As far as I am concerned, higher prescription glasses look very nice on a person.
At school, I am very active with the drama club, and student council.
When I had my last vision exam, the increase was not to big, and my prescription now reads, OD -8.75, 
and OS -9.00.
I like the looks of my new lenses, they show some depth.

There is a fashion show coming up, and a large optical store likes me to show some of their eyeglasses frames.
When they checked my prescription, they realized, I could not show their frames without proper lenses, so they are fitting me with contact lenses so I can show their frames, since only a few of the girls who do the modelling want to be seen wearing glasses.
With the way I style my hair, my ears are not covered, and my hearing aids are usually visible, I don't mind, hearing aids are like glasses, you need them, you wear them.

The show was well received, but I certainly would not want to wear contact lenses everyday.
Being so pleased with my performance at the fashion show, the optical shop offered me a part time 
position to help in the store, assisting customers choosing frames for their glasses, and they would like to use my pictures in their advertising.
I really enjoy the job at the optical store, and since more young people are prescribed to wear glasses now, I enjoy helping them in choosing a frame they like, and mentioning the benefits of wearing glasses, it is so satisfying.

Before I knew it, my last year of high school was finished, and I will start my college course for fashions and clothes.
At my last eye exam, my prescription went up to OD. -11.25, and OS.-11.75,and because I still work part time at the optical store, now have new glasses, and contacts in the right prescription, which is great for when I do some fashion shows.
During my courses, I find my love for drawing and sewing is a big help, and of course so is the modelling and self improvement course.

During our last year, the final part of our course, is a display of our designs, and a fashion show where we show some of our creations.
The display and show are very important, because in the audience there are always prospective employers, looking for a student with talent, so a perfect performance is very important.
The show went well, and as I had hoped for, I had some job interviews.
Because of my experience doing fashion shows, working at the optical store, wearing hearing aids and glasses, and not to forget my drawing and showing of my fashion line, was offered a position, that I could not resist.
The company I will be working for, has a fashion line, and an optical and hearing aid division, with a large number of stores.

I was all excited when on the first day that I started my new job.
To my surprise a few different departments, all wanted me to work for them.
The general manager decided I should start in the optical department, and when I was introduced to the manager, he showed me some pictures of models wearing glasses, that I had drawn.
He had selected a few, and asked me to draw some glasses pictures with a front view, and then showing the arms of the glasses.
A few days later, after I finished my assignment, I presented them to the manager, and we discussed the color and material of the frames.
He was very pleased with what I showed him, and told me they were going to make some samples.
A few days later I was called into the managers office, who showed me the samples and asked me to 
wear the glasses frames, while he took pictures.
I could not believe my eyes when I saw the pictures, I loved the look of all of them, and the manager is presenting them to management, for approval.
Not long after, I was told that my designs, the Emily series, were to go into production, and when finished, will promoted, and I will be very involved with the promotion.
Not long after, I spend almost a day, having my picture taken wearing the Emily line of glasses with my present prescription.
The reception of the Emily glasses was overwhelming, much to delight of management.
My next assignment was designing graduation dresses, while I worked on that, I was asked to wear and comment on a new hearing aid line.
One thing for sure no dull moments in my new job.
While designing new graduation dresses, I will be sure to draw in glasses and hearing aids, 
after all, I am the girl with the strong glasses and the hearing aids.
