If you have to wear glasses, wear them!!!!


I don’t mind having to wear glasses, to be honest with you, I would not want to be without 
my glasses.
Why? Well I can hardly see across the room without wearing my glasses.
I would have trouble recognizing myself, if I don’t wear my glasses.
And of course would not want to miss the opportunity of selecting a new frame after each eye exam, 
and the exciting feeling, of getting used to your new prescription, and looking through stronger lenses.


My name is Caitlin, I am on of two children, my younger sister Sarah is 8 years old.
Both my parents are myopic, I know that my dad wears – 6.00 glasses, and my mother is -7.00 or -8.00 quite a bit stronger than my dad
I am 17 years old, and at my last exam, my right eye went up to -5.00, and my left eye is now -575.
so you can see, I have inherited their myopia.
I like the look of the lenses in my glasses, I like the depth at the edges and the rings.
My girl friend Ashley, wears glasses, and keeps on telling me, she wishes her prescription
would be higher, she likes it, when a lens shows some depth and rings.
She always wants to try my glasses, so she can look at herself.
I have given her some of my previous glasses, so she can try to induce some more myopia, 
than the -2.25, that she is wearing at present.


I am now in my last year of high school, a good student and have no problem getting a date.
A lot of guys, seem to like the look of a girl wearing glasses.
This Saturday, I have a date with Ryan, a handsome guy, a fellow student in another class.
He is quite popular, and I am looking forward to my date.
When Ryan came to get me, he looked very handsome, and showed me, he is a gentleman,
the way he treated me.
We went to see a movie, and when we were seated and the movie had started, after a while, I noticed Ryan being uncomfortable, I asked him what the trouble was.
I have a problem seeing the picture properly.
Do you need glasses? 
Yes, I have a pair, but forgot to bring them.
I did not know you wore glasses.
I don’t wear them very often, I don’t think anybody knows, I wear glasses, I and usually sit close to the front in class, so I don’t have to wear them..
So we left the theater and went to the food court.
There I noticed he had a hard time, reading what was on the menu board even while standing at the counter.
After we had our refreshments, we went home, and he told me, he would like to try again the following Saturday, and I agreed, and looking forward to see how he would look wearing his glasses.


Ryan came to get me as agreed, but he was not wearing his glasses.
On the way to the cinema, I asked him where his glasses were, he said in my pocket, I don’t need them till we sit down, to watch the movie.
Can I have a look at your glasses?
Here they are, and he handed me his glasses.
I opened the case, and looked at the frame, a nice plastic pair of glasses, that I think will look very nice on him.
I took the glasses out of the case and had a look at the lenses, and noticed that they were not a very low prescription.
Ryan, do you know your prescription?
Yes, I think, it is a little lower then-3.00.
Ryan, please stop the car,
Why?
Well with you limited vision, if you don’t wear your glasses, I will not ride with you,.
When you have to wear glasses, wear them!.
You should be ashamed of yourself, driving without glasses, you are a danger to your self and everybody on the road, with your poor vision.
Do you have a restriction on your license?
Yes I have.
Well you realize what that means?
Here are your glasses, please wear them.
No, I can see just fine without them.
Ryan please stop the car.
So I opened the door of the car, and walked to a service station, to phone for a taxi, to take me home.
I never saw Ryan wear his glasses after that episode, and no more dates with him.


To day, my younger sister came to me all upset, at today’s eye exam, she was told she needed to wear glasses.
Caitlin, I don’t want to wear glasses, I think I look so nice without them, and I don’t want to be teased because I am a four eyes now.
When, Sarah went to bed, I sat with her, and gave her all the reasons why wearing glasses is not so bad, and told her some stories.
At last she settled down, and went to sleep.
My mother thanked me, for getting Sarah settled down, she had realized how upset she was about having to wear glasses.


The next morning, Sarah told me that she had a real funny dream, in her dream, the prince fell in love with sleeping beauty because she wore glasses.
Later in the day Sarah, and her mother went to get her new glasses.
I think she looks adorable, but she still hates her glasses.
It was not long thereafter that Sarah’s teacher informed my mother, that Sarah refused to wear her glasses when at school.
So the next day, my mother went to the school, the teacher invited her into the class room, and that is when my mother told all the kids, that Sarah, had to wear glasses, and explained to the class, why some people have to wear glasses, and others do not, and that you don’t make fun of them.
So remember, when you are told to wear glasses, you have to wear them!
Since that day, Sarah is wearing her glasses, and realizes she needs to wear them to see properly.


After graduating from high school, I did some part time jobs, during the summer. 
I worked in a store, and it was a big surprise to me, how many people could not read labels, and asked for help to read them..
How many people should be wearing glasses, and either refuse to wear them, or don’t realize they should get an eye exam.
Quite often, when I see people having their glasses in their hair on top of their head, 
I feel like saying, when you should be wearing glasses, wear them!




I went to college to become an optician.
In a new environment like college you meet a lot of new people, and always some people you really like.
I have a room mate, Olivia, who is taking a business course.
Olivia, is a very pleasant, well developed busty and good looking girl.
We both like to do some studying in the library.
A few weeks later, Olivia told me that lately she has had more headaches, than she used to have.
When was your last eye exam?
I cannot remember, a long time ago, do you think it might be my vision?
Possible, only an eye exam, will tell you for sure.
Will you come with me, I am so scared,
Yes I will be glad to help whenever I can.
About a week later Olivia and I walked into the optical store at the local mall.
I always enjoy going to an optical store to look around, and see the latest in eyeglasses frames.
When Olivia came out of the examination room, she looked very confused, carrying her prescription,
she walked over and handed me the prescription.
I read it, OD. +1.25 , OS. +1.00 and quite a bit of astigmatism.
No wonder she had headaches, and I was surprised she was hyperopic.
Well Olivia, I think you need to wear glasses full time, what did the Doctor say?
That I have to wear glasses full time, Caitlin, I don’t want to wear glasses, my boyfriend hates the looks of them.
I don’t think you have much choice, if you want to eliminate the head aches.
You will soon realize, that if you have to wear glasses, wear them!


When Olivia started to wear her glasses, she liked her new look, and after a few days told me she was so happy with her glasses, that she is sure now she would not want to be without them.
I am starting to get use to my new look, when I look in the mirror, and I sure have not had any more head aches.
I now understand why you don’t mind having to wear glasses.


We had our mid term break, and when I went home told them about Olivia and the courses I am taking.
The only news at home was, that Sarah , had an increase of a 1/2 diopter in her glasses prescription, but she did not mind, she is happy with her new glasses, and she is used to wearing her glasses now.
I got together with my friend Ashley, who is so excited because, her glasses prescription, is over – 3.00 now, and she has a boyfriend who loves her new look, and told her she looks so much nicer now, when wearing her glasses.


After the break, when I came back to college and saw Olivia, we sat down on the sofa, she was all upset, her boyfriend dumped her, because she is wearing glasses now.
I felt so sorry for her, that I hugged her and told her Olivia, you look beautiful wearing glasses, you are to good for him.
We still were in a hug, when I wiped the tears from her face, and I don’t know why, I gave her a big kiss, and told her, poor girl, I am so sorry.
Olivia reacted by kissing me on the mouth, and put her hand under my skirt and pleasured me.
What a wonderful experience, I moved my fingers under her skirt and sure made Olivia come in a hurry. we kissed some more, and looked at each other with a satisfied smile.
I had never realized before, that this can happen so quickly, but I sure loved the experience.
Olivia and I did not have anymore encounters, because Olivia told me she now has a steady girlfriend, and she did not want to cheat on her.
Perhaps just as well, I have been meeting, a nice young, glasses wearing fellow, and I am sure I like him better than a girl.


Looking around at all the students here at the college, I see a lot of them wearing their glasses, I think most of them, are smart enough to know, that if you have to wear glasses, you wear them.!!!!!


I have now graduated, and I am a licensed optician, and contact lens fitter.
On Monday, I started to work, at an optical store.
The present optician is retiring, and she will show me how the business is run. 
I am quite sure that in my new job, I will feel like telling some people,
that when you have to wear glasses, wear them!
But I don’t think I will, I like to keep my job.
