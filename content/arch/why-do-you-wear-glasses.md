Amy was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jones. They lived in a nice quiet neighborhood in a small city. Amy was in grade 5, a pleasant girl and a good very inquisitive student, always full of questions , so she could learn as much as possible about the subject she was interested in.
Her best friend Jenny, a very pleasant girl, was in her class at school. They got along well and spend a lot of time together.
The next day at school, Peggy one of their classmates was wearing new glasses. Amy told Peggy she looked very nice wearing glasses, and asked her why she needed to wear them.  Peggy told her she had trouble seeing the blackboard. Now with wearing glasses she had no trouble seeing anything in the distance. There were 3 other students in her class wearing glasses, and Amy wondered why people wear glasses, how can they improve your vision, are the lenses that special, she would like to find that out.
A few days later Jenny was telling Amy that lately she had a lot more headaches, when reading and using the computer, so her mom had taken her to their doctor and after he had given her a complete exam, suggested Jenny should get her eyes examined.
Jenny's mom had made an appointment for her on Saturday, and Jenny wondered if Amy wanted to come along, because she was kind of scared. She did not know what to expect and  did not know anything about glasses. Amy said she would like to come, she did not know anything about glasses either, but like to find out more about them, and why people have to wear them.
When Jenny, her mom and Amy entered Jones Optical store, could not believe the large selection of eyeglass frames on display.
This was all new to them.
Jenny and her mom filled out a form, and then Jenny went in for her eye exam.
Dr. Jim gave her a complete exam, and when finished came with Jenny to see her mother. He told her that Jenny had some astigmatism and was farsighted. Her eyes had to work harder to see properly for close work, which would cause headaches, he suggested she wear glasses. 
Glasses would make it easier for her to read and reduce eyestrain.
The girls and Jenny's mother selected a nice colored half frame that looked great. They were told to come back later and the glasses would be ready.
Jenny's mother was very surprised that Jenny needed glasses, she had never realized her eyesight was not perfect, and her vision problem was the cause of her headaches.
At the food court in the mall, Jenny told them about the eye exam, looking through the lenses, getting a puff of air in your eye. The Doctor using a bright light to look inside of your eye. It was a whole new experience, very interesting and it did not hurt.
When they went back to pick up Jenny's glasses, they were ready. When she put them on noticed right away how much easier it was to read, but looking in the distance everything was a little fuzzy. Marsha the optician explained that when wearing the glasses full time, her distance vision would be back to normal in a couple of weeks, as soon as her eyes and brain were  used to wearing the glasses.
Amy told Jenny she looked very nice wearing glasses, her eyes looked a little larger. Jenny's mother thought she looked very nice.
When they came home Amy had to try the glasses, when wearing them everything looked fuzzy, she could not figure out how they could improve your vision. When she looked in the mirror, could not believe glasses could change your looks that much, she was not sure if she liked that.
Jenny was now wearing her glasses all the time, did not have any headaches and noticed how much better she felt when reading and using the computer, and was happy to have them.

Amy's parents had to go out one night and Carla the regular baby sitter came to look after Amy and her brother.  They made some popcorn and watched TV. Carla rummaged trough her purse and took out a glass case, opened it and took out a nice pair of gold framed glasses and put them on.   Amy looked at her and asked when did you start to wear glasses? They look very nice, I like your new look. Carla told her that she could not pass the vision test for her drivers permit and now had to wear glasses when driving. She had trouble seeing signs in the distance and the glasses corrected that.  She found it easier to watch T.V. wearing her glasses, but she did not want to wear them all the time.
Amy told Carla about Jenny s glasses, and when she tried everything looked fuzzy and could not see much with them.
Amy then asked Carla  if she could try her glasses to find out what she could see wearing them.
Carla handed her the glasses and  Amy put them on.  When she looked at the T.V. noticed the picture looked so much better.
Amy said I cannot believe it, the picture seems much sharper and brighter. I never saw the picture this clear. How come when wearing your glasses I can see so much better than when I tried Jenny's. Amy decided she had to find out why.
Carla told Amy she looked really nice wearing glasses. Amy said I like the way the glasses feel, and the way the picture looks, can I wear them a little longer?   Carla said O.K. I want to make a couple of phone calls to some friends.
When Carla came back she told Amy she wanted her glasses. When Amy Gave Carla her glasses back she noticed the picture on the T.V looked fuzzy, she could not believe glasses could make that much difference, and wondered is this why you wear glasses.
The next day at school , she told Jenny about her experience with Carla s glasses. Jenny asked if she had any trouble seeing the blackboard, Amy said no I always it in the front of the class.
A couple of weeks later, Joan another girl in their class came to school wearing glasses. Amy complimented Joan how nice she looked wearing glasses and asked her about them. She told Amy her mother had noticed her squinting watching T.V.and sitting to close to the set. Her mother made sure she had her eyes examined and was told she needed to wear glasses. Would you like to try them? Amy said yes I would like to. When she put Joan's glasses on, noticed everything looked nice and clear, almost the same as when she tried Carla s glasses. Now she started to wonder do I need glasses ?
That night Amy worked on her computer and found out she might be myopic, but as far as she was concerned she could see just fine.  She also found out that sight deterioration is very gradual,most people don t notice it.
Then thinking about it, she became a bit concerned, she did not really want to wear glasses, but after trying Carla's and Joan's  glasses and noticing an improvement in her vision, was afraid she might have to.
The next day when she talked to Jenny about it', she suggested she should talk to her parents.
That day after school, Jenny went heme with Amy to copy some notes. 
This was the first time Amy s mother had seen Jenny wear her glasses. She told Jenny her glasses looked very nice , they made her look like a pretty young lady. She asked Jenny how she found out she needed glasses. Jenny told her about the headaches and the Doctor suggesting she should  get her eyes examined and then was told she had to wear glasses. I don't mind wearing glasses, I can see very well, no more headaches and they are comfortable.
Amy s mother told her it was good to hear that, then mentioned  that she had noticed a lot more young people wearing glasses now, Jenny said I know and I am sure Amy needs glasses to.
AMY DO YOU HAVE VISION PROBLEMS ? Amy than told her mom about trying Carla's and Joan's glasses, that everything seemed to look better, but she had no trouble seeing the blackboard at school..
Amy we are going to get your eyes examined and make sure. I will make an appointment.
Amy and her mother went to Jones Optical. After filling out some papers Amy went into the examination room.Being very inquisitive enjoyed going trough all the procedures and  asked a lot of questions. The part she liked best was the changing of the lenses and when  asked which is better.
When the exam was finished Dr. Jim asked her to look at the letters , which is better and when she said now, he told her that was going to be the prescription for her glasses.
Dr. Jim talked to Amy's mom and told her that Amy was myopic and should wear glasses.
It did not take Amy and her mom long to select a nice frame, and get the necessary  measurements done, and go the Mall and wait.
When they went to pick up Amy's new glasses, it did not take long to get them properly fitted. When Amy looked around, everything looked so nice and clear and the glasses were very comfortable, When looking in the mirror was pleasantly surprised how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Amy s mother gave her a big hug and told her you look so beautiful and grown up, I love you new look.
On the way home Amy could not believe the improvement in her vision, everything was so nice and clear, she loved it.
At last she found out  WHY YOU WEAR GLASSES.
