Hello friends, I present to you this little experiment that I did with the AI, it has not been my intention to bother anyone since it is not a story of my authorship nor can we consider it a story, however it was to play a little with this new tool and find out a bit within reach.  Curious fact: I made several versions by changing some parameters, the AI ​​always put a happy ending and always spoke at the end that the protagonist accepted herself with her defects and virtues. I used Google Bard. Another fact is that I did it in Spanish and then I used the translator.  Sorry if some sentences don't make sense.On some occasion the AI ​​decided that the protagonist looked for alternatives with her doctor and she underwent laser surgery, I said Oh No!, and I had to be very precise with the instructions, it was fun for me to put things on and take them off. Even after a while I had already tired of so many changes.

Between Shadows and Hope (The AI ​​selected the title)

Karen was a successful executive in her 30s.  With her intelligence, her ambition and her physical attractiveness, she had managed to stand out in the business world.  However, there was something that had always been an obstacle for her: her high myopia.  Ever since she was a teenager, Karen had had to rely on contact lenses to see clearly.  But everything changed when a small eye infection forced her to wear her thick heavy glasses.

 These glasses were uncomfortable and she constantly slipped off her nose.  Karen felt embarrassed when people saw her wearing them.  However, she was determined not to let that stop her from running.  Although she had a little more trouble adjusting to her new look, she continued to work hard and do everything she could to excel in her field.

 It was at a business conference that she met Alex, a charming and attractive colleague.  Alex had the reputation of being a conqueror and enjoyed having romantic relationships with his co-workers.  Despite warnings from his friends, Karen was attracted to him and they began dating.

 However, things got complicated when it came time to get intimate.  Alex was not happy with Karen's glasses and constantly demanded that she remove them before any passionate physical contact.  Karen felt vulnerable and unprotected when she couldn't see more than a few inches from her nose.  This made it difficult for her to move around the house without bumping into the furniture or even go to the kitchen to prepare a meal.

 Alex, sometimes mischievously, would hide her glasses to prevent her from wearing them.  Karen was very distressed by this situation, but her love for Alex kept her silent.  Over time, Karen became increasingly dependent on Alex, who became her guide when she did not have her glasses.  Although it was a difficult adjustment, Karen accepted that things would be like this forever and she decided to keep spare glasses in various places around the house and memorized the locations of some things.

 Karen and Alex's relationship deepened, and they eventually decided to get married.  They had three children, but each pregnancy further complicated Karen's vision.  Despite constantly upgrading her glasses, she found it increasingly difficult to drive her car or read fine print.  Sometimes when Alex came home a little drunk, he would laugh at Karen for not being able to read the letters on the TV menu or for not recognizing people from afar, even with her thick glasses on.

 During Alex's work trips, Karen would receive a visit from her neighbor, Tom.  Tom found Karen very attractive when she wore her thick glasses, and her kindness and understanding began to captivate Karen.  Although she was attracted to Tom, she Karen knew she was engaged to Alex and she couldn't afford to further complicate her life.

 Unfortunately, Karen was not a candidate for laser vision correction surgery and she was required to wear glasses for the rest of her life, as contact lenses as high-strength as the ones she required were not manufactured.  Despite all the visual difficulties she was facing, she Karen decided to go ahead and do the best she could with what she had.

 Over time, she Karen learned to accept herself just the way she was, with her thick glasses and her blurry vision.  She realized that her true beauty lay in her bravery, her perseverance, and her unconditional love for her family.  She learned to find joy in the little things in life and to value her ability to overcome the challenges that came her way.

 As the years passed, Karen became an example of strength and resilience to her children.  Although her vision worsened over time, she never let it limit her in what she wanted to achieve.  She continued to thrive in her career and found creative ways to accommodate her visual condition.

 In her heart, Karen would always carry the memory of Alex with her, but she finally realized that she deserved someone who loved her and valued her for who she was, with or without glasses.  Tom was always there for her, offering her support and understanding.  Over time, their friendship grew into something more, and she Karen found the love and acceptance she longed for.

 Although Karen's life was not perfect and she still faced challenges due to her high myopia, she had learned to find happiness in the simple moments and to value what really mattered in life.  Her story showed that although circumstances can be difficult, self-love and determination can help us overcome any obstacle and find true happiness.
