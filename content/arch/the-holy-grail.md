I am an optic obsessive person. I love to see and study people who wear glasses, and although I am fascinated by people who wear strong plus glasses my main focus is on those who wear minus glasses. I love looking at men or women who wear glasses that range from prescriptions in the low teens, all the way up to the very, very strong glasses that are worn by such a small number of people. An attractive young lady wearing a prescription in the low to high -20’s will immediately become the focus of my attention, and fortunately for me there are more and more of these young ladies around. To me, it is too bad that contact lenses have reduced my viewing pleasure considerably, although I know that those who have strong prescriptions have much better vision when wearing contacts. And I know that they also feel better about themselves because they do not stand out in a crowd wearing what they call coke bottle glasses.
 
To me, the Holy Grail of glasses are those who wear myodiscs that are so strong that the prescription cannot be guessed with a reasonable certainty of accuracy. Not that guessing prescriptions is very accurate anyway and a bunch of other men with similar interests to my own have nicknamed the guessing of prescriptions as “SWAG”, which stands for a scientific wild assed guess.
 
The spotting of a lady wearing what I call the Holy Grail of glasses is such a remote possibility that one cannot ever count on it happening in your lifetime, and although I have spotted a few that were close I never reached the point where I considered I had found the one person who could be considered ‘IT” The other day I walked into my local supermarket and waited while a lady got her buggy first. Since I was behind her I could tell that she wore glasses, but from behind it was not possible to get a good look and my guess from what I saw was plus lenses. I followed her into the store and over to the produce section and came down the aisle from the opposite direction. She selected some bananas and placed them in the cart as she looked up to see what was coming towards her before she moved her cart.
 
The lady was about 5’2 tall, probably about 120lbs or so and was reasonably well figured. But the glasses! The glasses she had on her face were exquisitely well made. They were double myodiscs set in a plus rear carrier, which is why I thought her lenses were plus when I glanced from behind.  The front of the myodisc circle was no bigger than a quarter in size. A quarter is about 25mm, and in a double myodisc the front circle – or button as it is more properly called – was, as it should be, a bit larger than the rear button. The rear button was no larger than the 18mm size of a dime. Instead of being set in a flat, or plano front base, the front of the lens had a slight concave curve to it, and of course the rear button was set in a fairly steep convex curve.
 
Although the glasses commanded most of my attention I had taken a look at her face. She was not unattractive, but could be considered a little on the mousy side, with her hair done up in a bun on top of her head. Because of the mostly grey hair streaked with the remains of her original black I guessed her age at being late 50’s early 60’s and her pale complexion indicated a person that did not spend much time in the sun. I had looked long enough, so before I gave her the vibes that I was staring at her I smiled at her and continued on my way, grabbing another couple of items from the produce section before I headed down the aisles.
 
She likely didn’t know the store, because I watched her carefully read the signs over the aisles before she walked down the ones she wanted. Her corrected eyesight must have been reasonably decent because she didn’t seem to have any trouble reading them as she generally found what she was looking for fairly quickly. I followed her and passed her a couple of times in different aisles, and in one aisle she was having trouble reaching what she wanted as the higher shelf was bare of product at the front of it so I asked her if I could help and I got her a couple of cans of a soup that was on sale.  
 
Of course this gave me a better chance to look at her glasses up close. The strong lenses minified her eyes so that the pupil was not much more than a dark dot in the very center of a pale blue circle of her iris. Then there was another ring at the circle of the inner myodisc with another circle defined by the outer ring of the front button. I thought of a dart board with the circles being the numbered rings. I had to stop staring so I averted my glance while she thanked me for helping her and I continued on my way.
 
I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable so I made sure I didn’t accidentally meet her again in the remaining aisles. I had taken a careful look at her hands, and I did not see any rings on her fingers so my mind started working overtime trying to figure out a good line to give her. As I had planned I ended up in the line at the cash register right behind her. She smiled at me and I returned her smile, but didn’t say anything. She walked out of the store pushing her cart, with me following a reasonable distance behind her. I watched as she hailed a cab, and saw the driver help her place her groceries in the trunk. The cab driver returned her cart to the line of carts and I continued to my own vehicle.
 
I don’t know why I didn’t say anything witty to her, nor do I know why I didn’t attempt to push the issue. But as I drove home I realized that if I had said anything, and she had responded in the way I could only dream of it would have spoiled the moment. She would no longer have been the Holy Grail of my dreams.
