David is a handsome, athletic and popular high school student, ready to start his last year in high school and looking forward to it.. Except he has no idea what reaction to expect about his new look.
During the summer his mother had insisted he get his eyes examined. She wore glasses and had noticed that David was squinting quite  a bit, she knew the signs and was sure he needed to wear glasses.
 After the eye exam David was told he was myopic and had some astigmatism and should be wearing glasses.
He was not very happy about having to wear them, but noticing the big improvement in his vision, realize it was for the best.
His friends told him he looked all right, which made him feel better.
When back at school , quite a few girls remarked how handsome he looked wearing glasses, which made him feel more confident, perhaps it was not all that bad having to wear glasses.
There was a new girl in his class this year, her name was Jodi, a pretty well built brunette .
She and her parents had moved into town this past summer, and not knowing to many students was a bit shy.
David liked her , introduced himself and helped her to feel at ease.
It was not long there after they started to date, they got along well  and enjoyed going out together.
At one of their dates , Jodi told David how much she liked the looks of his glasses, and how handsome he looked wearing them.
She told him she had always liked the looks of glasses on people.Jodi s parents and her older brother wore glasses. She had never given glasses for herself mush thought, she did not need them.
David told her he was now used to wearing glasses, and did not mind anymore having to wear them.
At their next date David told Jodi he wanted to go to the optical store first to get his glasses adjusted.
When they got into the store, Jodi could not believe the large choice of frames available, and wanted to try on some frames just 
for fun, and to see what she would look like wearing glasses.
When she tried some different frames , David told her you look great wearing glasses, you look terrific., I would not mind if you had to wear glasses,you look fabulous.
Jodi said , I did not realize I could look this good wearing glasses, but sorry I don t need them.
When she got home that night was thinking how nice it would be if she needed glasses .
David liked the looks of her wearing glasses, and she had been really surprised how nice the glasses looked on her.
She spend some time on the computer checking on glasses and lenses and also read about inducing myopia, how you might be able to become myopic.
She figured it was worth a try. since everyone in her family wore glasses for myopia, it might be in her genes, and it might work for her.
She also read that when you were still in you growing years, you had a better chance of inducing myopia, she was going to try and find out.
Her mother was myopic and had worn glasses for years, so Jodi was pretty sure there must be some of her old glasses around.
After looking through different drawers , she found two old pairs.
She was all excited, and when she tried them on, realized that one pair was not very strong , and when she tried them could see reasonable well.
The second pair was noticeable stronger and she could not see to well wearing them.
It did not take Jodi very long to see well wearing the weaker glasses .
Then she started to wear the glasses with the stronger prescription and it did not seem to take very long that she could see quite well wearing them.
She kept on wearing them as much as she could, it was her big secret , trying to become myopic and having to wear glasses.
She was excited, when after removing the glasses everything seem to be fuzzy and not very clear.
The next date with David, they went to see a movie, when Jodi noticed that the picture looked fuzzy.
She mentioned it to David, he told her it looked all right to him , that gave Jodi a good feeling, was her trying to  become myopic working ?
Jodi asked David  if she could try his glasses, and when she did noticed a big improvement in her vision
David asked her if the glasses made a difference. Jodi said a little, but she did not want to tell him how much better she could see wearing his glasses.
She was pretty sure now that it would not be long before she would need to wear glasses and could not wait, so she could surprise David.
Jodi was very happy with the progress she was making in becoming myopic.
The next day on her way home from school found a glasses case. When she picked it up and looked inside , there was a nice pair of glasses.
She could not wait to get home and try the glasses.
When she was in her bedroom and put the glasses on , noticed the prescription was a bit stronger than the ones she had been wearing. When looking in the mirror noticed some rings at the edges of the lenses  . She liked the looks of that and how it emphasized your eyes.
She was surprised how well she could see with the stronger glasses and now wore them as much as she could.
Since she had the stronger glasses now, she put her mothers old glasses back where she found them.
Since her distance vision was not good anymore , she had to sit closer to the screen , when watching T.V.
Her mother had noticed that Jodi seemed to squint more  and sat closer to the T.V.
When she asked Jodi if she had vision problems. Jodi said the picture looks fuzzy. Her mother said wait a minute, I think I know what your problem is. She went to her bedroom and came back with her old glasses.
Here try these, they are my old glasses, perhaps you notice a difference when you wear them.
When she tried the glasses, she told her mother that she could see best with the strongest pair. Girl you really need your eyes examined, I did not realize your eyesight was that bad.
So Jodi and her mother went to the Optical store to get her eyes examined
The optometrist after the exam told her , she was myopic and would have to wear glasses. Her prescription was minus 2.00 for the right and minus 1.75 fort the left eye and some astigmatism, and suggested she wear her glasses full time.
Jodi was a happy girl , she had done  it, she was myopic.
With her mothers help Jodi selected 2 smart looking frames, on a two for one deal,that would look great on her  and she was sure 
David would like them.
When her glasses were ready, and she tried them on was surprised how nice and clear everything looked, and loved the looks of them.
Jodi s mother said you look fantastic, but I am sorry we did not have your eyes checked before, Your prescription is almost as strong as mine.
That night at home all she did was look at herself in the mirror and enjoying the looks of her new glasses , and she noticed they even showed a bit of a ring  and she loved the looks of her eyes behind the lenses.
She experimented with some eye make up ,she loved her new glasses.
The next day she went to school proudly wearing her new glasses.
When David saw her , he came over and all he could say was you look fantastic , wow, you look great.
Why did you not tell me you were getting glasses?
Jodi said, I wanted to surprise you, I am so happy you like them.
Many of the girls commented on how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Jodi was a happy girl she had new glasses that she loved,and  a great boyfriend who liked her glasses
Time had gone fast and the school year ended, Her first year at a new school had been fantastic, she had many friends a great boyfriend  and discovered YOU CAN INDUCE MYOPIA.
