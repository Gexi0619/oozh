Amy is a 20 year old , studying to become  nurse. She is a very pretty, well endowed , blond girl, doing well in her studies. She lives in a rented room not far from the university
Her boyfriend Ken . a handsome guy, a couple of years older than Amy, works as a licensed mechanic and doing well for himself.
The two of them have been a couple since high school.
On a Saturday night , the two of them went to see a movie, Amy did not want to sit to far back, so she could see the movie better.
Ken said O.K.
After the movie they went for a drink and had a long talk. Ken suggested to Amy, she move in with him, there was lots of room in the apartment and she would have some extra money not having to pay rent.
Amy liked the idea and the following week moved into Ken s apartment. She had lots of time to study, since Ken worked quite a few nights . 
When Ken came home one night, Amy complained that she was having a headache again, she was studying for her exams , and the headaches had become more frequent. She said not to worry , the exams were almost finished.
The following Saturday they went to an auction sale. Ken was looking for some special tools and at this sale was a large variety of items.  Ken could not find what he was looking for, but Amy noticed that the auctioneer was going to sell a box of odds and ends, on top was a nice purse that she would like to have.  The auctioneer accepted her bid, they paid for it and happily took their purchase home.
That night Amy looked at the purse , liked the color and shape and was happy to have bought it
Next she went through the box of odds and ends , and found a pair of gloves that fitted her perfectly and looked great with the purse. When she looked further, she found some old pictures , an old compact and 3 eyeglass cases .
She slowly took them out and opened them up. In each case was a pair of glasses.
She did not know very much about glasses, but she was curious. 
She took a pair out and put them on, looked around, everything looked very fuzzy and distorted. Then she tried the next pair
and noticed everything looked nice and clear, and she could see well wearing them. 
She tried the last pair, but they were stronger, but not as strong as the first pair.
She took the glasses tat she could see with, put them on and went to the mirror to look at herself.  The gold metal frame did not look bad at all, and what surprised her most of all was how well she could see wearing them.
When Ken saw her wearing the glasses said, Amy I like your new look, you look great, can you see wearing them?
Amy told him she could see very good, everything looked nice and clear, and were comfortable to wear.
She tried the other glasses on again, one pair was definitely too strong,the other ones stronger than the pair she had been wearing
she could see wearing them , but not as well.
Ken wanted her to wear the glasses, he thought they looked great and liked the looks of them.
Amy agreed , they were comfortable, she could she well wearing them and it made her feel sexy.
The next morning Amy tried the glasses again and liked how well she could see wearing them, wore them all day  and surprisingly did not get a headache when studying.
She really liked wearing the glasses, she could see well, liked liked the feel of them and the looks of her eyes behind the lenses.
When she went back to classes on Monday she wore her glasses. She noticed again how nice and clear everything looked and had no trouble seeing the blackboard, She also received some nice compliments which made her feel even better.
About a month later , Amy tried the other glasses again, and noticed that now they did not seem to strong, she could see quite well with them and decided to wear them now as she liked the looks of the frame better. What she like too was that lenses showed
some rings , she liked that.
She again tried the strongest glasses , they were still a little too strong but loved the way her eyes looked behind the stronger lenses. She loved wearing glasses.
At some websites she learned more about glasses, and was very interested with looking at pictures of people with higher myopia,
she loved the looks of the lenses with the rings that made the eyes looked smaller and brighter.
She explained it to Ken , while she wore the strongest glasses, he noticed the rings and liked that look
Can you look like that?Amy said I don t know but will find out. 
From now on she was going to wear the glasses with the strongest lenses, that should satisfy him, and she could see better now 
wearing them, and loved the looks of the lenses.
She would like to know the prescription of the glasses she was wearing , she had read up on them and knew they were a minus prescription.
She went to an optical store and told the optician she had lost her prescription and was thinking of getting contacts.
The optician seeing a sale of contact lenses, took her glasses and checked her prescription , wrote it down and handed it to Amy.
She asked for the price of the contacts, and when told said that she would have to wait till next payday , thanked her and went home.
She looked at the prescription and it read right eye - 2.75 left eye -3.00 . 
Now she had the information she wanted but did not know what to do with it. She would love to have glasses with about - 10.00
lenses, like in the photos she had looked at, they should look fantastic.
Spending more time on the computer, found the site of Vision and Spex and read about glasses over contacts, she would love to try that.
After a while she noticed that SPECS FOR YOU in the next town ,specialized in high myopic lenses.
They might be able to help her, they were located about an hours drive away, so she made an appointment for Saturday.
She told Ken she had made an appointment  and he was as excited as she was.

When they went into the SPECS FOR YOU store, they noticed a lot of pictures of people wearing high myopic lenses, very impressive.
After filling out some forms, Amy went into the examination room.The optometrist gave her a thorough examination and told her 
that her new prescription had gone up a little.
Amy told him she was interested in G. O .C.could he help her?
She told him she liked the looks of the stronger lenses, and would like to see herself with a - 10.00 prescription.
He told Amy  he could help her, and figured out the numbers for the contact lenses, then went to get the lenses and put them in her eyes. All Amy saw was  a blur, then he handed her a pair of glasses and told her to put hem on.
When she put on the glasses she experienced a feeling she could not explain.
Th optometrist held up a mirror and asked her how do you like it.
Amy looked at herself and loved the looks of the lenses and her eyes , it was exactly what she wanted.
When Ken saw Amy with the trial glasses, he told her he loved tat look.
Next was to find the right frame for her new glasses, and also a frame for her regular glasses to accommodate   her new prescription.
The optometrist then told them since he specialized in high prescriptions had the lenses in stock and would have everything ready in a couple of hours.
His assistant showed Amy the way to handle contact lenses , and how to care for them.

After Lunch they went back to pick up the glasses. She tried on her new regular glasses and noticed the increase in her prescription, and liked everything about them.
Next she inserted her contact lenses and put on her REAL glasses, she loved the feel she got wearing them and when looking 
in the mirror was pleased how good her frame looked, and was elated with the looks of the lenses, the circles, the thickness at the edges and the looks of her eyes.
She wore the glasses for the rest of the day and just loved them.
She wore her new strong g.o.c. all day Sunday and enjoyed wearing them.
Ken loved her new look and wanted her to wear them everyday .
Amy said she might after she got used to wearing the contact lenses , but he would get to see them some nights and on  the weekends.
Her regular glasses looked great, the lenses showed some rings and she could see well wearing them

When she laid in bed that night and was thinking off all that  had happened since she bought her purse at the auction sale about a year ago. and how lucky she was that the auctioneer had accepted her bid. She had gotten the purse she liked and a whole lot more she loved.
