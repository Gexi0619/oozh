Kelley, Ann, and Kathy were studying hard for the final exams of the school year.Due to all the studying , Ann was having more headaches lately. When she talked to Kathy and told her about the headaches, Kathy suggested she should have an eye exam, she might need an increase in her prescription.   Here try my glasses they are stronger than yours. So Ann tried them on and noticed a big difference. I guess you are right , I notice a big difference, I can  see much better wearing your glasses.
Ann made an eye appointment for the following Saturday.
When Kelley found out that Ann had an eye appointment , asked if she could come and help Ann select a new frame., Ann thought that was a great idea.
So on Saturday they went to Jones Optical. While Ann had her eye exam, Kelley looked at at all the frames to find a real nice frame  that would look great on Ann.
After the exam, when Ann looked at her new prescription, noticed that the numbers were now -2.25 for both eyes quit an increase.
After trying almost every frame in the store , the girls finally decided on a nice light brown frame that looked fantastic on Ann, as it blended just right with her blond hair and blue eyes.
When all the measurements were completed, and paid the bill, the girls went to the mall.
 After refreshment and a lot of chit chat, went back to pick up Ann s glasses.
Ann was very happy with the improvement in her vision, and loved the looks of her new glasses. Kelley was speechless, she loved Ann s new look.
They went to Ann s place to show her parents her new glasses. Her parents complimented the girls on their good taste, they thought the glasses looked beautiful.
The girls went to Ann s bedroom, to try some different types of make up , to see what would look best. Kelley looked at Ann, took a step closer and put her arm around her and gave her a big kiss. At first Ann was a little shocked and than smiled. Kelley apologized ,
I can t help myself those new glasses made me do it. Ann said it is OK , I liked it , glasses do something to me to, that I cannot explain. I think everybody should wear glasses , i am sure they would enjoy it.
Kelley said I am sorry I don t wear glasses , I don t think I want any.
Ann said I am not so sure you don t want glasses, the way you look at girls who wear glasses ,makes me wonder if you are envious.
You don t realize what you are missing, wear my old glasses for a while , you might change your mind about wearing glasses.
Kelley said I don t really want to wear glasses, but if wearing them makes you feel that different , I think I have to give it a try to find out what it feels like to wear glasses.
Ann handed Kelley her old glasses, and when she put them on and looked around  noticed that the glasses made her feel different.
Ann said you look great , walked over to Kelley and gave her a great big hug, and when the glasses touched it felt very exciting.
Now Kelley started to realize that there was something special about wearing glasses , they gave you a wonderful exciting feeling,
and were comfortable to wear.Kelley had no trouble seeing with Ann s glasses, matter a fact everything looked so nice and clear she kept on wearing them. Ann said it looks like you like wearing my old glasses, and have a feeling you like to get your own.
That night at home Kelley told her parents that she thought she needed to get her eyes examined, after she explained why, her parents agreed , and an appointment was made.
Kelley was now looking forward to the eye exam, and was very happy when Dr.Jim told her , her vision would be better wearing glasses.   It did not take Kelley very long to find a nice black plastic frame that she really liked and looked good on her.
When she went to pick up her glasses and tried them on, was thrilled , she loved the looks and feel of them, and noticed an improvement in her vision and wondered why she had waited this long.
She went to show Ann her new glasses. Ann loved her new look and told Kelley she loved her choice of frame , you look adorable now , I am so glad you are wearing glasses now.
When Kathy saw Kelley wearing glasses , she could not believe it and told her she looked great and welcomed her to the glasses club.

A new family moved into the house next to Ann s home. It did not take long for her to meet them. Mr. and Mrs. Walters were very pleasant people. Their daughter Audrey was a little older than Ann, a good looking dark haired girl , who looked mature and confident, she wore nice black glasses that looked good on her.  Her brother Patrick was about Ann s age . He was a pleasant  well developed athletic type and he wore glasses.
Ann being the sweet type of girl she was, made them feel very welcome to the neighborhood . She liked Audrey , but the glasses wearing Patrick was in her opinion a most perfect male, and really liked him.
Since the Annual Teen Dance was in a few days , Ann suggested Audrey and Patrick to come with her, so she could introduce them to her friend and some of the students from school. They thought that would be great , they would like the opportunity to make new friends.
Ann had informed Kelley and Kathy she would be bringing her new neighbors so they could meet them.
At the night of the dance Kathy , her boyfriend Brandon and Kelley were waiting.
When Ann, Audrey and Patrick came in it did not take long to get to know each other  and lots to talk about.
When the music started , Brandon asked Kathy to dance. Patrick and Ann soon followed.
Kelley did not mind to be left with Audrey,there was something special about that girl, besides wearing glasses , that she liked very much, Kelley noticed that Audrey was wearing a nice rainbow bracelet . Kelley said Audrey I love your bracelet, I think you are my kind of girl, Would you like to dance with me.
So Audrey and Kelley danced , and enjoyed the opportunity of having a nice talk and getting to know each other. Kelley complimented Audrey on her nice hair, while she touched the ends of it . Audrey said I think you are beautiful,and love the looks of your glasses, I am so glad to have met you, and like to get together sometime soon.
Kelley said i would like that, I think you are the girl of my dreams.

In the mean time Kathy and Brandon were reminiscing about last years dance surprise.Brandon said I am glad I let you try my glasses , because wearing glasses suits you, you look beautiful .Kathy said I am glad I asked you to show me your glasses , you look great and now we both can see properly.
Ann and Patrick were getting along really well. Patrick told Ann she looked beautiful, he liked the color and style of her hair , her nice blue eyes  looking  even more attractive wearing glasses. Ann smiled and thanked him.
When the dance was finished , Brandon gave Kathy a ride home, and since it was a beautiful summer night the others wanted to walk home. 
Audrey told Patrick to see Ann home, she was going with Kelley to see where she lived. When they reached Kelley s home , they parted with a hug and a few kisses, and made plans to meet the next day.
