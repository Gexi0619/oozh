description: Curious about the world of glasses, Carl experiments with different lenses and discovers a newfound fascination and comfort.
---
It was toward the end of summer holidays, Carl was ready to go back to high school and looking forward to it.
It was a rainy day and he was bored and looking for something to do, when he spotted an old magnifying glass, picked it up and 
held it at different distances and angles. It was really fascinating. You could enlarge everything you looked at , and if you held it just right everything was  as clear and sharp  as you could wish for, it was unbelievable.
Being an inquisitive student who liked physics, he went to his computer to get more information.
He ended up spending many hours on his computer getting information about lenses.
He found out about eye glass lenses and their use in eye glasses.
He learned about concave lenses, used for people with myopia.. and convex lenses , such as his magnifying glass used to help people with presbyopia and hypermetropia .
With all the information he had gathered he stated to take notice of everybody who wore glasses.
He had no knowledge about glasses , nobody in his family wore them, and he wanted to know more about them.
When looking at people who wore glasses he tried to figure out the type of lens they were using for their vision problem.
He started to wonder what it would be like to look through prescription lenses, he wanted to find out.
He went to the neighborhood drug store where they sold reading glasses from +1.00 to +3.50.
He tried them all . The glasses with the + 1.00 prescription were all right , and after trying them all knew that they were just like a magnifying glass.He had his answer on convex lenses.
Now he wanted to try concave lenses used for myopia, they looked more interesting , but were not available in the drug store.
How to get hold of myopic lenses to try and see what they were like, . It would have to be from somebody who wore glasses for myopia.

Jim , who lived next door, and was a year ahead of him in high school, wore glasses and Carl was almost sure they were for myopia.
The next day he found an excuse to talk to Jim, they talked about sports, school and what they had done during the summer
Carl also told Jim that he was studying about lenses, and asked him if he could try his glasses.He told Jim he wanted to find out what it was like to look through concave lenses.
Jim said sure, I don,t think you will see to well with them, my last prescription was- 3.50. When Carl tried them on everything looked very distorted .your eyes felt different. He could not see much wearing them and gave them to Jim and said you are right they are to strong for me.Jim told Carl that when he first got glass in grade 6, the prescription was -1.00 and I have been increasing ever since, the next was -1.75 and then - 2.50 .
Jim said I have all my old glasses, they are no use to me , you can have them.Carl said he would sure like that, so Jim went back into the house and came back later with 3 eye glass cases . Carl thanked Jim and went home very happy now he could try glasses with concave lenses and find out what it was like to look trough them.

Back home Carl went into his room and opened the glass cases and sorted them to what he thought was the lens strengths .Than he tried his new glasses.The first pair that he knew were -1.00 were fine he could see everything quite well. The second pair were noticeable stronger, they gave his eyes a funny feeling, that he liked and he could see reasonably well  wearing them..The last pair were to strong and everything looked out of focus.
He put the first pair back on and walked around his room and looked out of the window everything looked a little smaller and further away but sharp and clear.He also noticed that wearing the glasses was comfortable, and kind of liked the way they felt on his face.
Then he tried the second pair again,he seemed to see a little better this time and got that funny feeling again, he seemed to see better with them the longer he had them on.
Wearing glasses was a kind of exciting, they were comfortable, liked the feel of them and made you feel different.
He looked at himself in the mirror and was surprised how well he looked wearing glasses.

There was a new movie at the mall theater  that he would like to see,but would like some company. He thought of Laura one of his class mates. She was a pretty girl with honey blond hair  and a pretty nice figure, they had dated before, so he asked her if she would like to to come, she agreed and they would meet at the mall food court.
Carl was waiting at the food court when Laura came.After greeting each other and chatting about the summer holidays went to the movie theater .
Carl asked Laura where she would like to sit, she said past the middle toward the back would be fine., so they picked their seats and settled down.
Laura got a pair of glasses out of her purse and put them on.Carl said I did not know you wore glasses. Laura said I just got them last week, I am a bit nearsighted and need them for distance.now I will be able to see the movie just fine. I will have to wear them in class when we go back to school.
When the movie had started Carl noticed the picture was a little fuzzy, and was wondering if it could be his eyesight.
He mentioned it to Laura.She said there  must be something wrong with your eyesight , the picture looks perfect to me. Would you like to try my glasses.Yes I would like to said Carl,see if they make a difference.So Carl tried Laura , glasses and they sure made a difference.
After the movie they went to the food court for some refreshments.Laura was still wearing her glasses, Carl remarked how good she looked wearing glasses. Laura thanked him and said she was happy the glasses looked so good. because she was very unhappy when told she needed to wear glasses. She was slowly getting used to them , and found them comfortable to wear, liked her improved vision, they made her feel confident and started to like them.
She asked Carl if he ever had his eyes examined, because she thought he might be needing glasses ,there was nothing wrong with the quality of the picture. I think you will look very handsome wearing glasses, I like the look of glasses on men.

When Carl came home he tried on the second pair of glasses. His vision seemed to be better when wearing them, he wondered if had ruined his eyes and needed glasses now , or that it just happened ,he was not sure.

When he went back to school he started to realize his vision was not very good. He sat in front of the classroom and when he looked down the hallway everything became blurry.
That night at supper he told his parents that he thought his eyesight needed to be checked, he had trouble seeing the blackboard
if hr sat to far back.
They agreed he should have his eyes examined, they were not surprised with all the computer and other close work young people did these days.
His mother made an appointment for him for the following Saturday.
At school  he talked to Laura and told her he had an appointment to get his eyes checked Saturday, and asked if she would like to come and help him select a frame.
She said I love to , you know how I feel about guys with glasses, she would meet him at he optical store.
He told his mother that Laura was going to help him select the glasses, his mother thought that was a great idea.

When Saturday came, Carl was a bit nervous. Now he would find out what an eye exam was like, he had seen all the videos on his computer
He met Laura in the mall she was wearing her glasses and looked beautiful , they went to the optical store. Carl filled out the necessary paper work and went into the examination room he knew what to expect.
He ended up with a prescription for -1.25 for the right and -1.50 for the left eye

When he came back in the store, Laura had a number of frames ready for him to try.Laura loved every minute of it, this was fun.
At last they decided on a plastic frame the right color and shape, they would look great.
The optician did the proper measurements, Carl paid the bill and was told to come back in about an hour.
So they went back to the food court, and talked about glasses. Laura told Carl that she really liked her glasses now besides the improved vision, she liked the feel and looks of them and felt naked not wearing them.
She could not wait to see Carl in his new glasses.
When the tine came to pick up the glasses they were both very exited
When the optician put the glasses on Carl s face and got them adjusted, Carl looked around and everything looked clear and sharp.When he looked at himself in the mirror he was very happy with what he saw. Laura thought the glasses looked even better on him with the proper lenses. She loved the looks of his eyes behind the lenses and thought he looked fantastic.
Laura suggested they should go and see a movie to try our the new glasses and it was a success and they had a wonderful time looking at each other.
When Carl came home that night his parents  thought his glasses glasses looked very nice and  that Carl did the right thing having Laura help him ,.
That night when Carl was in his room he looked at himself in the mirror and liked what he saw , glasses were all right and now he knew what people saw looking trough concave lenses. Then he put the magnifying glass in his dresser drawer carefully, that is what started it all.
