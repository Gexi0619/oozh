Let us make a deal!!


My name is Sarah, about eight months ago, I married my college sweetheart Randy, and we have moved into a nice, new apartment building.
We purchased some nice furniture, and now, are getting used to apartment living.
I work at a lawyer’s office, and Randy, is a manager at a medium sized business.


I have noticed, that some other young couples, are now moving into the buildings, vacant apartments.
To day, I met one of the new couples, Lindsay, and her husband Kyle, who, to my surprise was a class mate of Randy, when he went to college.
When I talked to them,. I was told, that another one of Randy’s classmates, Jim, and his wife Sadie, are also moving in..
I am quite sure , Randy would like to have a chance, to meet with his class mate again. 
So I invited, both couples, to have a drink, and some snacks, at our apartment, Saturday night, .


It was like an old boys reunion, when the men got together, and they sure had lots to talk about.
I now, had a better opportunity, to get to know both Sadie, and Lindsay.


Lindsay, is a very good looking natural blonde, busty, good figure, and a very pleasant girl,.
Sadie, has a beautiful head of dark blonde hair, and nice brown eyes,
and is small build.
I have black, curly type of hair, and a darker skin, and I am medium build 
All three of us are about the same height. 
We seem to like each other, and plan on doing some shopping, and other things, and have a good time together, while the men are playing golf.


When the men are playing golf, they play 9 holes, go for lunch, and play another 9 holes, in the after noon , so we girls have lots of time to be together..


A couple of weeks later, all of us went to see a movie.
During the movie, Lindsay, who sat beside me, complained about.
having a headache.
Do you have many headaches? 
Lately, I have some at work, but to night, I am having trouble seeing the movie, clearly, the picture looks fuzzy.


The next time, I talked to Lindsay, I asked her about the headaches,
and if, she might have a vision problem.
Not that I know of, and I know, my vision is perfect.

The following Saturday, when we girls got together, Sadie said, what are we going to do to day.?
We, are going to the optical store, said Lindsay
Then, she told us, that when she went to renew her drivers license, she did not pass,.the vision test, and will not get her license renewed, until she had a proper eye exam.
I have an appointment, for an eye exam, this morning .


So, the three of us went to the optical store, for Lindsay’s eye exam
While Lindsay, had her exam, Sandy and I, had a great time, trying all the different, glasses frames, we took a lot of pictures, on our phones, while, wearing some of the better looking frames, which we should not have done.


While trying all the different frames, and looking at the pictures, of men wearing glasses, I am sure, that Randy, would look fantastic wearing glasses.


When Lindsay’s exam was finished, she told us, the optometrist had told her, she should wear her glasses, all the time.
Does Kyle know, you were having an eye exam? 
No, he does not, I don’t know, how I am going to tell him, that I have to wear glasses now. 
He is Mr. Perfection, and I don’t think he will be thrilled, when he sees me wearing glasses.
Well, we will help you, first of all, let us find, the perfect frame for you, that will make you look beautiful.
Surprisingly, it did not take us long, to find a frame, that Lindsay really liked, and sure looked very nice on her.
The optician told us, the glasses would be ready after lunch.


Wile having our lunch, we showed Lindsay, the selfies, we took, trying different glasses frames.
Wow, you girls look fantastic wearing glasses, I hope I will look that good, wearing glasses.


When we went back, to the Optical store, Lindsay’s glasses were ready, and after she put them on, and had a good look around, said yes, now I am sure, that I need to wear glasses, I cannot believe, that when I wear the glasses, my vision is so perfect, everything I look at now, is so nice and clear.
When she had a good look at herself in the mirror, liked her new look, but will Kyle like her new look?


On the way home, we stopped for a coffee, and while having our coffee, had to try, Lindsay’s new glasses.
What surprised me, when I was wearing the glasses, realized that wearing the glasses, sure seem to improve my vision, do I need to wear glasses? 
Sadie, mentioned, when wearing the glasses, she had noticed that everything she looked at, looked fuzzy.
.
Lindsay is still worried, how Kyle, will react, when he sees her wearing glasses.
Have you two, any suggestion, how, I can get Kyle to know that, I am wearing glasses now.
You are going to be at our place to night, and then we will show Kyle, his beautiful, glasses wearing wife.
Have the glasses in your purse, ready to wear., I have it all figured out


That night, when we got together, the guys were in a real good mood, they had a good day at the golf course.
While, they were enjoying a glass of wine, I was in the kitchen, getting some snacks ready, to be served.
I asked Lindsay, if she please come, and give me a hand, to serve some of the snacks.
When Lindsay, came into the kitchen, I suggested she put her glasses on, and then serve the snacks.
Lindsay put her glasses on, and when I looked at her, and told her, don’t worry, you look fantastic.

All the conversation stopped, when Lindsay, entered the room, wearing her new glasses..
All, I heard, Kyle saying, Lindsay what the...., are you doing wearing glasses?
Let me have a good look at you,. 
Lindsay, went over to Kyle, and he had a real good look at her, then said, what a surprise Lindsay, you look fantastic wearing glasses.
Then, all of them, were told the whole story, off how, and why she is wearing glasses now,
All the guys, liked her new look, and Lindsay was all smiles.


So, what other surprises do you girls have?


Well, Lindsay said, you should see, their glasses wearing pictures, they have on their phones.
Now, they all had to have a good look, and when I heard, all their comments, made me realize, we should not have taken the pictures.


The next day, Randy asked me, he would like to see, my glasses wearing pictures again.,
After I handed him my phone, Randy looked at the pictures for quite a while, before he said, Sarah, I would like to see you wearing glasses, I really like your glasses wearing wearing look,


Being quite sure, that I would be prescribed to wear glasses
I suggested, let’s make a deal, I will, start to wear glasses, when, you start to wear glasses,.
I know, you will look very handsome, and studious wearing glasses.
Why, don’t we make an appointment for an eye exam, and find out if, one of us needs to wear glasses.
I know, that my last eye exam, was about five years ago, and I don’t know, when you, had your last eye exam.
Randy, thought about it, and slowly, agreed, and asked me to make the appointments.


Randy, wants to see me wear glasses, I don’t mind, because, I know, I should be wearing glasses., and he will have his eye exam, and I would love, nothing better, then to see him wearing glasses.


I was kind of excited, when we entered the optical store, for our eye exams.
Randy wanted me to go first, while he looked around.
When the optometrist ,finished my exam, and gave me my prescription, she suggested, I wear my glasses full time, as I have some astigmatism.
Then it was Randy’s turn, he was all smiles, when I told him I will be wearing glasses now..
Great, I am looking forward to see you, wearing a beautiful pair of glasses, all the time


When Randy, came out of the examination room, said, I can’t believe it, I have to wear glasses. I am what the doctor called hyperopic , and have some astigmatism
.
I never realized, that I would feel this excited, finding the right frame for Randy
It took us a while, but I like his selection of frame,.and he likes mine.


The next day after work, we went to pick up our glasses.


After, the optician finished adjusting my glasses, I looked around, it was, as if I looked ,at a whole new world, everything I looked at was crystal clear, I loved it.
The best thing, I have done for a long tim, was to make a deal. for both of us to get our eyes examined. 
Now he can look all he wants, at my glasses wearing face, and I can look at his, what a deal!
