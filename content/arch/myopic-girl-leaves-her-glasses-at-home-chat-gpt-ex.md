The chat gpt is big on anti-harassment rules and doesn’t want to write glasses fiction. However, I convinced it to once I said to “keep it pg” here are the results. 

Once upon a time, there was a person who woke up one morning, ready to start their day. They grabbed their bag, keys, and phone, but as they walked out the door, they realized they had forgotten something important. Their thick myopic glasses were sitting on the nightstand, right where they had left them the night before.

Feeling a bit panicked, the person quickly weighed their options. They could either go back home to retrieve their glasses or try to make it through the day without them. They decided to give it a try and see how it went.

As they walked down the street, everything looked blurry. Signs and faces were difficult to make out, and they had to squint to see anything at a distance. They stumbled a few times, bumping into objects they couldn't see clearly.

At work, it was even more challenging. They couldn't read their computer screen, and they had trouble focusing on their tasks. They had to ask their co-workers for help, and they felt embarrassed and frustrated.

Throughout the day, the person felt like they were missing out on so much. They couldn't see the details of the world around them, and they felt like they were living in a hazy dream. They couldn't wait to get home and put their glasses back on.

Finally, the day came to an end and the person rushed back home. They grabbed their glasses and put them on, feeling a wave of relief wash over them as the world came back into focus. They realized how much they took their glasses for granted and made a mental note to never leave them behind again.
