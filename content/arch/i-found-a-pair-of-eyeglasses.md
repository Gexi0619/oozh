I found a pair of eyeglasses..........

 It is a beautiful sunny day.
 I put  my back pack on,   jumped on my bike and went to the park.
There is nothing more  relaxing then sitting on a park bench ,listening to  the sounds of nature while  studying  for  final exams.
My favorite spot is deserted ,great nobody to bother me.
I am studying for my science exam , my favorite subject.
I was pretty well finished ,when my stomach told me it was time  to get going , to  be home in time for supper.
While  putting my books and notes in  my back pack  ,I noticed a pair of eyeglasses under the bench.
I picked them up 
A  nice looking  pair of plastic men s glasses.
Part of my science course this year is optics..
I now  know the diference between concave and convex lenses 
Looking  at the lenses in the glasses , noticed the are concave, so the glasses are to correct myopia.
When I put the glasses on , I was sure  they are  low prescription. ,because I could see perfect everything  looked  very clear and defined.
I also noticed everything seemed a little smaller and further away, I liked that.
I kind of enjoyed wearing the glasses, biggest surprise,  I can  see so well wearing them , and they are comfortable.
On the way home I stopped at the park office ,and  reported finding the glasses.
The park manager told me all he wanted was my phone number.
I don t want anymore glasses in my desk.
Look here , 3 pair from last year ,and I don t know what to do with them.
Can I have them?
Sure !  
He gave me the glasses and I put them in my back pack.
On my way home I wondered, what had made me want  those glasses.?
I never have  given glasses much thought before , had finding the glasses changed that.?

After supper I went up to my room and unpacked my backpack.
I put my find ,the men s plastic glasses on , looked in the mirror and was surprised how good I looked   wearing the glasses.
Since I could see perfect , and  enjoyed wearing the glasses, I wore them all night. .
 I had a  look at the glasses the park manager had given me.
There is a nice tortoishell pair of ladies glasses , with a low myopic prescription.
A  gold metal frame with a stronger myopic prescription .
And a pair of kid s glasses with concave lenses.
I spend the night on the computer to learn  more about vision and glasses. . 
Believe it or not , I don t know  what has happened to me  , I  am all excited about the glasses now.
I even think I would not mind having  to wear prescription glasses. 
I like the look of myself  wearing glasses and find the  glasses are very comfortable  to wear.


Karen is my girl friend , and I have a date to night to take her to a movie.
When we were seated ,  just before  the movie started I put  my glasses on.
Bryson , when did you start wearing glasses ?
Let me have a good look at you.
Wow ,you look very handsome wearing glasses, I love your new look.
Why did you not tell me you were getting glasses ?
I wanted to surprise you ., and I like your reaction .
Are you supposed to wear glasses all the time ?
No , just when I think I need to wear them.
The movie started and I was surprised how well  I could see so when wearing the glasses .
After the movie was finished, I took my glasses off and I notced a slight blur.  
We went to the food court.
When we sat down with our snacks, I looked at the menu board , and noticed I had a bit of  trouble reading it.
I put my glasses back on and  had no trouble reading it.
Karen asked me if she could try the glasses .
When Karen put the glasses on and looked around , told me she loves the feel of them and was surprised how well she could see.
How  do I look wearing glasses ?
I think, when  wearing the proper frame you would look fantastic.
On the way home Karen asked me to make sure  that I wear my glasses on the next date .
I love the look of you wearing glasses., you look so handsome.

So Karen would like me to wear my glasses all the time. 
I enjoy wearing glasses , and like to wear them full time, 
What should I  do.?
I decided to tell my mother that I had noticed some vision problems and perhaps should have an eye exam.
When I talked  with my mother ,she said  if you have a problem ,we better get that looked after right away. 
I will make an appointment for you.
Before going for my exam, I studied up  about eye exams on the computer.
I was excited when I went in for my exam , now I had a good idea  what to expect.
After the exam, I was told  that I am myopic and was prescribed glasses.
My prescrition read -0.75 on the right and – 1.00 on the left eye., and a bit of astigmatism.
What a surprise .
I am so happy ,now I can wear glasses all the time
I selected a frame similar to the glasses I had found.
After the optician had taken the necessary measurements, 
I told him, that  I had a couple of pairs of glasses at home ,and would like to find out the lens prescription.
He told me to bring the glasses  in when I picked up my new glasses and he would get me the prescriptions of the other glasses.


When I went to pick up my new glasses , I brought the  glasses .
After being fitted with my new glasses , I  handed the optician the glasses I had brought.
While waiting I looked around and enjoyed my improved vision .
The optician came back and handed me the glasses.
He told me that he had some old glasses cases  and put each  prescription in the case with the glasses .
I thanked him and could not wait to get home.
When in my room opened the glasses cases.
The glasses I had found are – 0.75 for each eye , almost identical to my present prescription,
no wonder I could see so well when I was  wearing them.
The gold framed glasses are -1.75 , and – 2,00
The ladies tortoisheshell are -.50 and – 0.75
The kids glasses are+ 1.50 and + 1.25  . 
I am so excited all those lovely glasses , and me happily wearing glasses .
What has happened to me.?

On the next date Karen and I went dancing .
She told me since I had started to wear glasses, is now  more aware of other  people who wear glasses. 
She had  never realized so many people wore glasses , and how nice most people look wearing glasses.
Karen   surprised me again when she asked  me to look at  the  glasses  a girl on the dance floor was wearing 
I love the look of her glasses ,what a nice frame , women can sure look beautiful wearing glasses. 
I agreed and told her , that  I love the look of women wearing glasses 

The next time we were in the mall, I had to go to the optical shop to get my glasses adjusted.
While waiting Karen tried on some  frames.
On the way home she told me how she loved the look of herself wearing some of the frames.
If I can look that good wearing glasses , I think I would not mind having to wear glasses.
Well if you would like to try wearing glasses ,I might be able o help you.
I have a very nice pair of ladies glasses with a very low myopic prescription, which I think might look  very nice on you.
If you would like to try the glasses , I will bring them  on our next date
Yes , I love to try them, I would like to find out what it is  like to wear real glasses.. 

The next date , when I picked Karen up at her house , the first thing she asked me ,did you bring the glasses?
I told her I did .
When we got settled in the  car , I handed Karen the glasses case.
She opened the case ,   and looked at the glasses.
Nice glasses !!! 
I like the shape and the color .
Slowly she put the glasses on .
Karen looked around and said ,what a surprise , I can see everything nice and clear.
How do I look ?
You look beautiful.
Let s go to the mall, I want to see what I look like in front of  a big mirror.
We went to the mall and   into a clothing store to the change rooms area, where they have big wall mirrors.
When Karen saw herself ,smiled .
Thank you Bryson for the glasses.
 I love my new look , the glasses look fantastic.
Looking this good  , I want to wear the glasses all the time.
I am glad you like the glasses, I think you look fantastic.
So Karen started to wear the glasses . 
She told her family they were the new fad ,  fake glasses with plain lenses .


About a week later,  Karen mentioned to me that after she took her glasses off ,
everything in the distance lookes  blurry, .
Why does that happen ?
Well the glasses have a myopia prescription, and your  eyes and brain are getting used to you wearing 
the glasses , perhaps you are a bit nearsighted.
You mean I should have an eye exam , and will be prescribed prescription glasses ?
That is possible.
What a dillema., what should I do?
Should I keep on wearing the glasses without getting an eye exam, or should I get an eye exam and a proper prescription ?
Karen , do you have a drivers license ?
No, my dad does not want me to drive till I am 18 .
Well you are almost 18, go and apply for the license .
Don t wear your glasses ,I am quite sure you will fail the vision test ,
So Karen went and failed the vision test .
She told her parents , and an appointment was made for an eye exam.
Karen is looking forward to her exam, she knows she will told she is myopic.
After the exam , her prescrition read – 1.00 for the right and – 1.25 for the left eye.
When she put her new glasses on , could not believe the improvement in her vision.
She looked fantastic wearing her new glasses , and  she loves wearing  them.
Karen s younger sister Jennifer wanted Karen s old glasses and she now wears them all the time.
Since both of us love glasses so much I  decided I should  become an optometrist , and Karen wants to be an optician.
I now wonder what would have happened  , if I had not found a nice pair of men s glasses 
under a park bench.
