The importance of an eye exam.


I am the only girl, and have two older brothers, who both are university students.
I have heard a lot of people, mention, how pretty and beautiful I look.
I don’t know why, I have nice dark blonde hair, that I am very proud off, and is always looking nice and tidy, nice skin because I look after it, and brown eyes, 
I don’t think I am beautiful, but I am satisfied the way I look.
I am a member of the cheerleaders, for our football team


What a surprise it was, when I was selected the home coming queen, at our school,.
It sure was nice to get all the attention, and I received numerous requests, for dates.
That is the time, I met, my future husband, Randy, a very handsome, and well build man.
We both went to university, and married after we graduated.


We are happily married, and are the proud parents of three, healthy, adorable girls., Mandy, Cindy, and Sandy.
Mandy, is ready to go to start grade one, at the end of summer.


To day, I received a letter from the department of transportation, that it was time, to renew my drivers license.
When I arrived at the office, I was told, I had to take a vision test.
I sat down, with the examiner, and looked into what looked like a little box,
I was really surprised, I was not able to read, all the letters properly, and I was told to come back, when I was wearing my glasses.


That night, when I told Randy, about my failed vision test, he was very upset, he does not like the looks of glasses, and he is sure there is a mistake, there is nothing wrong with my vision.


I now don’t know what to think, I realize, that lately, I have had more headaches, and I do not like driving after dark, are those vision problems?




I have no other choice, then to make an appointment, for an eye exam., I need my drivers license, to transport, our girls.
Not having had, an eye exam, for years, I have no idea what to expect, nobody in my family, wears glasses.


Walking ,into the optical store, and looking at all those glasses frames on display, made me wonder, what will I look like wearing glasses, if I have to wear glasses.
I did not have time, to think about that, because I was asked to fill out a sheet, with some questions.


After my eye exam, the optometrist, when handing me my prescription, wondered why I had waited this long to get an eye examination, you sure are myopic, and should wear your glasses, full time.


I have to wear glasses, now, I have to find a frame, that looks good on me, and I hope my husband will like.
The optician, was very help full, she suggested some frames, that after I tried them on, and looked at myself, liked the looks off.
I took some selfies, and after having a good look at them, decided, on a frame, that perhaps, my husband might like, I did.


That night, after telling my husband, I was prescribed to wear glasses, showed him the selfie, of the frame, I had selected.
He told me, I would like to see me you wear the glasses, first, he does not like to make a comment, on just a picture.
.
I had the children, with me, when I went to pick up my glasses.,
I should have known better, the girls, had a great time trying all the kid’s frame.


When, I put my glasses on, and looked around, could not believe my eyes, everything, I looked at was so nice and clear, no matter what I looked at.
What a pleasure, to see so well, I had never realized, my vision had been that poor.
Looking at myself, was delighted, that I looked that good.


When, Randy, came home, looked at me, are you suppose to wear the glasses all the time?
Yes, I do, why, don’t you like them?
I like your looks better without wearing the glasses, why don’t you get contact lenses?
I never thought of that, I will have to find out about that.


When, I checked with the optometrist, about contact lenses, she suggested I wear my glasses, for about 6 months, and come back, for an evaluation, and then we can talk, about contact lenses.


I love my glasses, and I wished my husband would like my glasses wearing look, but he is of the old school, wearing glasses, shows weakness.


----------




Because, I am wearing glasses, I now realize, that a person does not realize, they have a vision problem, until they have a proper eye exam, that is why I make sure ,the girls have a yearly eye exam.
My husband thinks, it is not necessary, he thinks, that at an eye exam, all they want to do is sell you glasses. 


I have noticed lately, that Sandy, when reading a book, that her eyes are very close the page, which is not a good sign.


The year, that Mandy, was going into grade 3 , and the girls had their yearly eye exam, before staring another school year, we got a really big surprise, when all three were prescribed to wear glasses.
Sandy, the youngest one, has the strongest prescription, she is – 2.50 and -2.75, 
The girls are all excited, they are going to wear glasses, and had a great time, selecting frames, that they would like to wear.


When, my husband was told, all the girls had to wear glasses, got really mad, and went to the optical store, to tell them off. 
When, he talked to the optometrist, gave her a piece of his mind.
The optometrist, calmly, told him what the reason was, for his girls having to wear glasses.
Then she asked him, when he had his eyes examined? 
I cannot remember,.
Well, I have time, if you care to sit down, I will examine your eyes. and explain to you, what we do, during an eye exam.
Randy, was not expecting, anything like that, the optometrist, by her calm reception of him, sure calmed Randy down.
Then she asked him to sit down, and started his eye exam.
The optometrist, spend a lot of time, checking the health of Randy’s eyes, and told him that she could see, if a person might be diabetic. or have other health problems and she will notify your physician about her findings.
Then she gave Randy a vision test, which he passed, 
Now Randy, realized, there is more to an eye exam, than selling glasses
After completing the visual test, the optometrist, told Randy, your eyes are nice and healthy, and your vision is good. you don’t need to wear glasses. 


When Randy, came home, he told me he was sorry, about getting mad, about the girls having to wear glasses, and then, told me what had happened
.
When the girls, started to wear their glasses, Randy, made sure that they wore the glasses all day.
He now tells, his wife, she looks beautiful wearing glasses.
and now realizes why a person, has to wear glasses, and the importance of an eye exam,
