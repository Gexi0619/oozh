Jimmy was a regular 10 year old who loved sports and was a good student.
The baseball season was just starting and Jimmy loved playing ball, he was a better than average hitter and outfielder.
The night of their first game his parents and neighbor came to watch him play.
The first time at bat he struck out, and felt pretty bad about it. Later in the game he missed catching a fly ball.
His parents were concerned they had never seen him playing this poorly. The neighbor lady, who wore glasses, was wondering if Jimmy had trouble seeing the ball. She mentioned it to Jimmy's parents, they had no idea, because Jimmy had never complained about not seeing properly. After the game his parents asked Jimmy if he could not see well, he said that he had no trouble, that the opposing pitcher seem to be hiding the ball until he saw it  come across the plate. The fly ball he missed just 
seem to come out of nowhere. His place at school was in the front row, he could see pretty good.
His parents were not familiar with eye problems since neither of them wore glasses,or ever had an eye exam.
The next day Jimmy,s mother was having coffee with the neighbor lady, and they were talking about Jimmy,she thought Jimmy had vision problems, she remembered going through similar experiences. 
She told Jimmy's mom that as a child you don,t know or your vision is as good as it should be and suggested she gets Jimmy,s eyes tested.
So Jimmy's mom made an appointment for him, and after he came home from school she took him to the eye doctor for an eye test. 
After the test was finished the doctor came to talk to Jimmy,s mom and told her Jimmy was nearsighted and had a slight astigmatism, and should be wearing glasses.
So his mom took him to the optician to pick out a pair of glasses, Jimmy was not to happy about this at all.
After trying out several frames Jimmy thought he liked a metal frame the best, they would be ready for him the next day.
So when the time came to pick up his glasses after school the next day ,jimmy sat patiently while the optician adjusted
his new glasses. When he was finished he asked Jimmy to look around. Jimmy could not believe he could see everything so much better.
On the way home he told his mother how much better everything looked, and he felt much better having to wear glasses.
At dinner that night Jimmy's dad told him how good the glasses looked on him and his mom was very pleased.
The next night there was an other ball game. Jimmy proudly wore his glasses, now he could see.
The next turn at bat he could see the ball  and had 2 hits, and could see any ball coming to the outfield, and did not miss any.
After the game on the way home he told his parents how happy he was with his glasses.His parents had a smile on their faces all the way home.
