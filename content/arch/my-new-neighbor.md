My new neighbor

 Glasses wearing John and I [Kate] have a lovely growing family.
Jenny ,Peter and Nicole.
John is a  +2.00  hyperopic , and I am a – 5.50 myopic, we both started to wear glasses when we were in public school.
Our oldest girl, Jenny is 10 years old. 
She is myopic, and her prescription is already – 2.25.
She started to wear glasses when she was 7 .
After Peter started to wear his + 1.25 glasses , enjoys reading, and is doing well in school..
The biggest surprise at our last eye exam was when Nicole was prescribed glasses .
She is only 5 years old and now wears – 0.75 glasses, quite strong for such a young age.
I am afraid both girls will end up with prescriptions like my -5.50 or even higher..
All of the kids seem to be content having to wear glasses, they are happy to have proper vision.
I guess seeing their mom and dad wearing glasses makes it easier to accept that wearing glasses is no big deal.
Except for vision problems we are a happy, healthy family.

New neighbors moved in next door.
All we know about them is that  they are a young couple, with a daughter we guess about 5 yrs old 
A few days later, while I was working in our garden a female voice said hello to me.
When I looked up it was our new neighbor.
She introduced herself and told me that her name is Carol.
When I looked , saw a very pretty brunette, a little younger than I am.
Katie is my name, glad to meet you. 
I invited her in for a coffee, she accepted.
She told me her mother had taken her 5 year old daughter Amy out for the day.
While we were talking Nicole came in to say hello.
Carol, looked at her and said, is she is wearing real glasses ?
When I told that she was, she asked me why would she have to wear glasses at that age?
Because she is nearsighted.
What is that? I don t know anything about glasses .
She is what they call myopic and can see well when things are close, but everything in the distance looks fuzzy.
If she would play with my daughter who is her age, is it contagious?
No, you don t have to worry about that.
We had a long chat, and I found out that she does not know very much about vision problems. 
She loves gardening as much as I do, and we decided we should get together again.

After Carol left , I was thinking about our conversation about wearing glasses, and how little she knew.
Of course I realized I grew up in a glasses wearing family.
I am afraid that she is a person who might find out by surprise that vision problems are very common, without a person realizing it.

We started to visit back and forth, and became friends.
Amy liked Nicole, and seem to be fascinated with her glasses.
She told her mother she would like glasses just like Nicole.
The glasses look so pretty, and the lenses sparkle, I like them.
Carol said you don t need glasses, your eyes are perfect,
you only wear glasses when you cannot see very good.

One day when Nicole and Amy were playing , Amy asked Nicole if she could try to wear her glasses.
Nicole handed Amy the glasses and she put them on.
When she looked around smiled and said I can see everything, and I like the glasses.
Nicole said you better give them back, your mother would not like it when she sees you wearing my glasses.
When Amy took the glasses off said, I think I like to wear glasses, I can see better.
Back home Amy told her mother that she tried Nicole s glasses and that see could see better.
Carol told her daughter not to wear Nicole s glasses again, you will ruin your eyes. 
Daddy and I can see just fine and you do to, and you don t need glasses.


Katie and Carol went shopping at the mall with Amy and Nicole. 
Both girls were going to school in a few weeks, and since both were growing, needed some new clothes.
Sitting in the food court having some refreshments, Katie noticed Amy squinting quite a bit when looking around.
When Katie mentioned it to Carol, she said I know, I do it to if I want to see better.
Nothing wrong with squinting, we can see just fine.
Katie knew from experience both Carol and Amy most likely needed to wear glasses,  it was just a question of time and they would find out.


When school started both Amy and Nicole started in grade one. 
They both liked to sit in front of the class and were good students.
Later that fall when Carol and her husband went to meet the teacher, at meet the teacher s night. 
The teacher told them that Amy was a good student, but she had noticed that Amy might have a vision problem.
Carol said she can see just fine, if she squints a little I am not worried about that.
Then they had a look at some of Amy s work.


 About a week later Carol went shopping.
When she approached an intersection, with a stop sign, did not notice a car coming her way, and they almost had a collision.
The car she had not noticed was a police cruiser.
The policeman pulled her over, and asked what happened.
Carol told him his car seemed to come out of nowhere.
The policeman ,could not believe her story, and wondered why she had not seen him.
He asked Carol if she could read the numbers on the license plate on his car parked about 20 feet ahead of her car..
No, I can t, it is all fuzzy., I think it should be cleaned.
Well I think you need to get your vision checked, I will notify the department of transportation.
You can expect a notice for a vision check up in the mail, and I like to advise you not to drive until you have vision correction.
All shook up, Carol drove home.

That night she told her husband what had happened.
He told her don t worry about it ,when you have your vision check up at the license bureau you will pass.


Next day when Carol was visiting Katie, she told her the whole story.
What shall I to do now?
Well I have noticed you squinting a lot, and I am sure, you have a vision problem.
You will have to  make an appointment to get your eyes examined, you have no choice .
Carol asked me which doctor I used, and made an appointment.
Because Carol was nervous about driving, I drove when she went for her eye exam.
After the exam was finished she was all upset.
Katie, I have to wear glasses, and handed me her prescription.
I looked at it, right eye -1.25, left eye – 1.00, and some astigmatism.
Carol, welcome to the glasses wearing club.
I see by your prescription you need to wear your glasses full time
Let s find you an attractive frame.
Carol found a very attractive frame, and after the measurements were taken , was told the glasses would be ready in about an hour.

We went to the food court for some refreshments. 
Carol was very upset, what would her husband say when he sees her wearing glasses?
I told her not to worry about that, because with the frame you selected, you will look fantastic, and he will  love your new look.

When we went to pick up Carols s glasses, they were ready.
The optician adjusted the glasses, and when Carol looked at herself in the mirror, smiled ,she looked better than she had expected, she liked her new glasses wearing look.
When she looked around could not believe the improvement in her vision.
While we were driving home, she would take her glasses off and put them on again and could not believe glasses could improve your vision that much.
I cannot believe it, I was sure I had perfect vision.
Katie, now I wonder about Amy.   
The teacher told me she thinks Amy might have a vision problem,  I told her we all had perfect vision, what shall I do?
Take  Amy for an eye exam, and you will know for sure if she has a vision problem.
The next day when Carol came over, she was all smiles.
Her husband loved her new look so much, he even had her wear her glasses when they went to bed.
He told me to make sure that Amy get her eye exam.

When Amy had her eye exam, she was prescribed glasses.
She looks so cute wearing glasses and she loves wearing them. Now she is just like Nicole.

Carol received her notice to get a vision test for her drivers license.
She passed the test and now has a restriction on her license, that she has to wear her glasses when driving.
Carol likes wearing glasses now, her husband likes her new look, and is happy that she can see so much better now.
She realized that Amy s teacher was right about Amy having a vision problem.
And that Amy likes wearing her glasses , now has proper vision.
She is very proud of wearing glasses just like Nicole.

When Katie and Carol had another get together . 
Carol said, I am so happy to have moved next door, and have you as a friend.
With your help we learned to understand vision problems, and now we are able to see the way we should.
My husband loves my new look , Amy likes her glasses, I like my glasses.
I am sure glad you are my new neighbor.
