description: Unexpected inheritance leads to a peculiar love interest with a secretary who mystifies with her appearance.
---
A couple of years ago my aunt, who was also my godmother, passed away.  I had not expected to receive anything from her, as she was a woman of modest means and she had lived long enough after my uncle had died that I thought she likely would have exhausted most of her income.  I was surprised to receive a letter in the mail from a firm of solicitors a few months later.  The letter explained that my aunt had left a bequest for me in her will, and asked me if I could call their offices to set up an appointment.

Figuring that it wasn't a big deal I waited a couple of days until I had a chance to make the call without it interfering with my work day.  The phone was answered by a lady with an extremely pleasant sounding voice, and of course my mind wandered to thoughts of how this lady looked.  My biggest fantasy about women is that they wear glasses, but there are very few ladies that have decent prescriptions that do wear glasses these days.   I set up an appointment to see my aunt's lawyer in 3 days time, and I went back to work, promptly forgetting the secretary with the really pleasant sounding voice.

I had booked off work that afternoon and I drove into my aunt and uncleâ€™s old district where they had lived all of their married life.  The law office I was going to was within walking distance of their old house and I parked on the street near it.  Then I walked to the lawyers, arriving a little earlier than I had planned for my appointment.

I don't know if my jaw dropped when I saw the secretary or not. I presume it did.  She was wearing glasses, and although these glasses most likely had the highest index and the thinnest possible lens available they still had a myodisc appearance in that the outer edges were devoid of any prescription and you could see where the bowl of the lens ended before it reached the frame.  But while her glasses were absolutely captivating to me, she really wasn't. She wore rather a drab looking brown 2 piece suit, and she wore her hair up in a bun on top of her head.  I had to sit in the waiting room for a while and I was able to converse with her a bit.  I discovered that she was only 26, a couple of years younger than I am, and that she was not seeing anyone at the moment.  I know it was the glasses that made me do it, because I asked her out to dinner that night.   I was a little surprised when she accepted, and I agreed to pick her up at her apartment at 6:30 pm.

My bequest wasn't huge, but having an unexpected 5 grand was going to help a lot.  I made pretty good money as a logistics manager for a reasonably large company, but my savings account had not grown at all recently and this check was going right into the bank.  As I drove there to deposit my money I had second thoughts about my date that evening with the mousy, plain looking secretary.  The glasses were the only thing that attracted me to her and I was looking forward to being able to look into her minified eyes through the front of those strong lenses.

I was a couple of minutes early when I rang the bell to the front door of her apartment building.  She buzzed me in through the front door and I took the elevator up to the 7th floor. Her apartment wasn't far from the elevator and I rang her bell with trepidation.  The girl that answered the door couldn't have been the same girl I had met at the lawyer's office.  This girl didn't have glasses and her hair was fairly long, cascading down both sides of her face.  The dress she wore was red, and while it wasn't so bright that it hurt your eyes to look at it, it was far more colorful than the drab brown outfit she had worn earlier.  The only thing that convinced me that this was the same girl was her melodious voice asking me in. 

Part of me was disappointed that she was wearing contacts.   Of course I didn't ask, because I knew that from seeing her wearing her thick glasses there was no way she could have functioned without glasses or contacts.  But another part of me was thrilled that this drab and mousy lady turned out to be a fox in disguise.  If I had taken the mousy, thick glasses wearing lady to meet my friends I am sure that I would have been embarrassed by her appearance.  But this girl - even with her glasses she would have looked beautiful.  And I know I am as shallow as all get out, but I don't think I am much different than any other guy would be in a situation like this.  You have to feel that you are proud of your partner for a relationship to work.

Connie asked me in and offered me a beer or a glass of wine.  I don't care for wine, so I accepted the beer and we sat and talked.  She was very easy to talk to, and she seemed to be well versed on any of the subjects we discussed.   I discovered that she had gone to law school herself, but had not finished her articling and was working for the law firm until she finished.  I didn't think it was a good time to tell her that I wasn't fond of lawyers and that I consider many of them as leeches on society so I just kept my mouth shut.

We had to leave for our reservation at the restaurant so we finished our drink and headed out.  When she told me earlier where her apartment building was I realized that there was a nice quiet little restaurant within walking distance that I liked so we headed out on foot.

We were seated in a cozy little corner and when we were given the menu's I noticed that Connie seemed to be having a little trouble reading the in the darkened atmosphere.  But I was very careful not to say anything even though I was dying to talk to her about her glasses and her vision.

We had a wonderful dinner and an extremely good time together. When I walked her back to her apartment door I did kiss her goodbye, but I declined her invitation to come in for a nightcap.  I just casually mentioned that I would take her up on that offer when I didn't have to work the next day, so she was not insulted or anything.  Before I left I had asked her to go with me to the state fair on Saturday, so we definitely were going to see each other again.

We had a real ball at the fair.  She wore jeans and a very feminine looking Harley T-shirt and she looked fantastic. I commented on the Harley T shirt, and she just mentioned that one of her ex boyfriends had ridden a Harley and bought it for her.  She didn't have really big breasts, but the Harley shirt and jeans showed that she did have a very nice figure.  She wore a pair of heavy framed oversized sunglasses, and I got to be keeper of the sun glasses when we were on a couple of the rides. I would rather have been keeper of her real glasses, but that certainly wasn't going to happen. She obviously was a smart girl and she knew that it was better for her to wear her glasses to the office and her contacts when she was dating. I just hoped that someday she would wear her glasses for me, but I knew I had better not bring up the subject.  She knew I had asked her out when she was wearing glasses and I felt that she knew that this meant that they didn't bother me and that someday she would wear them in front of me.

Over the few years that I had been dating I discovered that there were some girls who always bitched that they couldn't find a decent guy and that all the guys they went out with wanted to have sex.  But then when they went out with a guy who didn't want to have sex with them on the first date they bitched that he wasn't interested in them.  I didn't feel that Connie was like that, and I was determined to take it slow and easy, If we were right for each other the time would come.

And, after dating for about 3 months the time did come.  We had been to an early show and when Connie asked me in for a nightcap the nightcap turned into an all nighter.  I came very close to blowing it though when she told me that she needed to take her contacts out. She did so and she came out into the living room wearing her glasses and I almost came in my pants.

"I guess you have seen me in my glasses before, but how do I look now?" Connie asked.

"The only way you could look any better would be if you had nothing on but your glasses." I replied.

"What do you mean by that?" Connie asked a little sharply.

"I only mean that I would love to see you naked and I realize that that will never happen unless you are wearing your glasses so that you can see what you are doing." I replied.

I guess that was the correct response, because she said that the only way I would see her naked was if I matched her in disrobing piece for piece.  Before long we were standing naked in the living room holding and kissing each other. It didn't take long before we were in the bedroom and I was fumbling for a condom, which I slipped on.

"Jeff, please take my glasses off and place them carefully on the nightstand." Connie requested.

So I complied and we made love. After we were finished we laid there holding each other and then she asked for her glasses back, so I placed them carefully on her face.  She went into the bathroom and after using the toilet she got into the shower. I needed to use the toilet as well, so I went in after she got into the shower, and after I used the toilet I climbed into the shower with her.  Her glasses were on the countertop and she was in the shower with her eyes closed, so I helped her soap her back. We both rinsed off, and I handed her the towel, which she used. She grabbed her glasses, and reached into the closet and got me a clean towel for me to use.  Then we went back to bed and turned out the lights. After the lights were out we just lay there and talked for a while until we fell asleep.

The following morning was a Sunday and neither of us had to go anywhere so we just lay in bed holding each other until Connie made the mistake of putting her glasses on so she could get up and go to the toilet. When she came back to bed we made love again before she managed to take her glasses off, and I was very careful not to smear them, or knock against them while I was kissing her. When we finally finished we decided we would get up and go out for breakfast after we showered again.

"You obviously do not mind me wearing my glasses so I guess I won't bother putting my contacts in today." Connie said.

"You were wearing glasses when I first met you and asked you out, so I accepted the fact that you wore them.  You look really good when you are wearing contacts, but you also look great wearing glasses.  So, wear whatever you feel comfortable with and it will be fine with me." I replied.

That morning we went out for brunch with Connie wearing her glasses. I was dying to know a little more about her glasses and how good her eyesight was, but from past experience I knew better than to ask any questions or show any more than a casual interest. She was attractive enough and she wore strong enough glasses that I was not going to ruin my chances with her.

And I expect that in the long run that was the best possible course of action.  Over the next couple of months as we dated I managed to find out everything I wanted to know about her glasses history.  Apparently Connie needed glasses almost from birth, but this was not discovered until she was almost 2 years old. Her first prescription was around -18D. Fortunately, over the years her prescription did not climb that much higher, and now at age 26 she wore glasses with a prescription of -28.50D, which had been stable since she had turned 22.  When she was 8 she was fitted with contact lenses, which she wore exclusively until she was 25.  The constant wear of contacts had caused a corneal tear in one eye, so she had been forced to wear glasses until the tear healed and her doctor would allow her to go back to contacts.  But after she returned to contact lens wear her doctor had wanted her to reduce the amount of time she spent wearing contacts, so she decided wisely that she would wear her glasses at work, and would save her contacts for when she was dating or other special occasions.

I made sure that I complimented Connie on her appearance a little more whenever we went out and she was wearing her glasses.  Before long it seemed that she was wearing her glasses more and more and if she ever asked me if she should wear her contacts for any reason I always told her that she looked great wearing glasses so she needn't bother with her contacts for me.

By now Connie had finished her articling and she was going to be called to the bar.  I was with her for the ceremony and watched with pride as she got her diploma.  She did choose to wear contacts that day, and I could understand that.  But her contact lens wear had dropped off to almost never, so I hoped that this would continue into our married life.  She didn't know it yet, but I was going to ask her to marry me that evening.

When I did ask her and gave her the engagement ring I had chosen she accepted my proposal.  The bequest from my godmother had been a nice little surprise, but meeting Connie had been the real bonus.
