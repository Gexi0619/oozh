This is not a true story but some schools in the Southern Indiana area just North of Louisville Kentucky do get to together for student theater productions on occasion.
Three schools in Southern Indiana decided to join forces for a complicated production of the TV series "The Wonder Years". The series was based on teenagers growing up in the late 60's and early 70's. The series dealt with issues of the day such as the death of an older Brother of one of the main people that was killed in the very unpopular war in Viet Nam. The series had a school named after Robert Kennedy after he was killed by a gunman. The series was considered somewhat cutting edge.
Bookworm Paul was the only regular who wore glasses. Ironically a student named Josh tried out for and won the role of Paul. Ironic for two reasons one being the actor playing Paul first name was Josh. The other irony was Paul's Dad in the series was an Optometrist and Josh's Dad is also one. One of the adults involved in the play knew somebody from the series and was able to get permission to do the play.
Student Josh wore glasses when needed for mild Myopia only having to get them when he almost failed his drivers license exam. Josh who did not need glasses full time could simple wear them in the play but there was a problem. Josh thought the now popular black frame "Nerd" glasses Paul wore on the show looked stupid. The play was going to cover when Paul got contacts but that was no problem. Stagehands would hold up signs out of sight of the audience telling the student actors which way to move and so on. Josh could see the signs without glasses so he would just go without an correction when contacts were introduced. Originally a local optical store was sponsoring the play and would make any simple prescription glasses for free but the national chain about a month before the premier put a policy in place forbidding the sponsorship. The play wanting to look realistic did not want to use fake glasses and priced the glasses at local optical stores. One of the teachers at the main school who wears contacts most of the time suggested Zenni Optical where for less then $20 shipped they were able to order a pair of the correct glasses. That was one problem solved.
Problem two came when 17 year old Wayne playing the part of Kevin Arnold who was the main focus of the series showed up for the final week or rehearsal wearing strong Myopic glasses. In the series Kevin did not wear glasses though portraying actor Fred Savage apparently wears glasses. Wayne who had a somewhat complicated prescription had wore contacts since age 11. Wayne's contacts were on a three week backorder. No area provider had contacts in that prescription. Since Wayne and Josh were from different schools they did not know each other.
Wayne on the night before the play opened was taken to Josh's Dad's office for an exam though he had just had one at his regular Optometrist two months before. Luckily Josh's Dad disagreed with Wayne's regular Optometrist about what type of contacts to use and he had them in stock. The play went on and was a huge success. The play was so successful the cast and crew were invited to perform it at a prestigious theater in New York City ended. The play as had the series used a narrator and the only adult heard was the narrator. The teacher not involved in the theater could not go to New York so he made a recording to be played during the New York shows.
Wayne after the play started wearing his glasses more mainly wearing contacts when doing plays where the character he plays does not wear glasses. The only reason Wayne got contacts in at age 11 was he had been playing basketball for his school but gave that up for his first love that being theater.
