description: Tracy, a 6-year-old girl, becomes obsessed with glasses after trying on her friend's pair, leading to life-changing consequences.

**Long time reader. First time posting. Constructive feedback is appreciated** 

My name is Tracy, and I’m 6 years old. I’ve wanted to wear glasses for as long as I can remember. I’ve always been intrigued by them, and loved how they made people look when they’re wearing them. Neither of my parents, or my older brother wear glasses so I figured I may never need them. 

My friends Janice and Megan both started to wear glasses a short time before Kindergarten ended. I learned that both of them are nearsighted. Shortly after summer break began, we were all over at Janice’s house one day, and they were comparing their glasses. I felt left out because I didn’t wear them. Janice said that her prescription seemed to be stronger than Megan’s. 

Megan said that her glasses were -1.25. Janice said that her paperwork said that she wore -2.25. Personally, I loved the looks of Janice’s lenses more. They were noticeably thicker than Megan’s. But, at this point, I would have been happy with either pair. When Megan had to go home, I stayed for a while longer. I asked Janice if I could try her glasses.  What happened next would change my life.

Janice said that she got two pair, because of a buy one, get one sale. She gave me her spare pair of glasses. So, I put them on, and immediately felt different. I was able to see with them just not perfectly clear. I wore them for about two hours, before I had to go home. Janice asked me if I wanted to take them home. Of course I wanted to! I wore them until I got close to my house and took them off. I really liked how my vision was blurry for a short time afterwards. 

The whole time during dinner, I wanted nothing more than to go to my room and wear “my” glasses. My dad noticed that I seemed a bit preoccupied, and asked what was the matter. I told them that I wasn’t feeling well, and wanted to go lay down for a while. I was excused, and went to my room. Once there, I put the glasses on, and looked around. After a short time, everything seemed to be as clear as it was at Janice’s house.

I started to read, and watched some TV for a couple of hours before I took the glasses off and went to bed. Before turning out the light, I put the glasses in my nightstand drawer, just in case my parents came to check on me. That night I had the best dream. I dreamt that I was able to wake up and put on my glasses and nobody noticed. Almost like I’ve worn them for sometime, and everybody was used to it. It was wonderful!

The next morning, I was woken up by my mom, asking me if I was feeling alright. I said yes, and got up to begin my day. I got cleaned up, and dressed before going downstairs for breakfast. I avoided going back to my room for a while as to not draw attention. Later that morning, Janice called and asked if I’d like to come over to her house again. I of course said yes, because I knew I would be able to wear the glasses all day.

As soon as I got to her room, I put the glasses on. A short time later Megan arrived, and noticed the glasses. Tracy, when did you start wearing glasses? Janice said that I was wearing her spare pair. We all talked about our glasses all day. It was great. About 4:30 I went home for dinner and totally forgot about the glasses until I was at my front door. I quick took them off and hid them until I could get to my room. The blur seemed to last a little longer this time. 

This went on over the next several weeks. I would hang out with my friends at their houses, or we would spend the day at the local mall. Either way, I was wearing “my” glasses every possible moment. I loved it! Megan and Janice got so used to me wearing the glasses that neither of them noticed I was wearing them anymore.

About two weeks before school started I was having real troubles seeing the TV or other things in the distance if I wasn’t wearing my glasses. I told Janice and Megan, and they both said that I needed to get an eye exam, because I most likely needed glasses of my own.  That night at dinner, I told my parents that I was having troubles seeing clearly. My parents were concerned especially since they don’t wear glasses. 

After dinner my mom called Megan’s mom, and asked where they go for their family’s eye exams. Her next call was to Benson’s Optical. She was able to get me an appointment for the next afternoon. When I got back to my room, I called Janice and told her that I had an eye exam the next afternoon. She was excited. Next I called Megan and told her. She was excited too. I could hardly sleep that night because I knew that in less than 24 hours I would officially need glasses. 

The next day I was at Dr. Benson’s office getting my eye exam. I knew what to expect from what my friends told me. Janice even gave me some tips on how I could get stronger glasses. I guess that’s why her glasses are a bit stronger than Megan’s. I used some of those tips, and after a while, Dr. Benson took me back to the waiting area, and told my mom that I was quite nearsighted for someone my age, and that I will certainly need to wear glasses full time. She also said that I would need to be back in 6 months for a recheck, and that I would most likely need a noticeable increase by then.

The doctor handed my mom a card with my prescription on it. I couldn’t believe it when I read -3.25. That’s even stronger than the glasses I have been wearing. I couldn’t wait to start wearing them. We spent a while picking out the right frame. Since the buy one, get one offer was still available, we picked out another pair. My mother opted for the thinner lenses because she didn’t want it to look like her 6 year old daughter needed such strong glasses. I didn’t mind if they looked thicker.  

A few days later I was the proud wearer of my very own glasses. The first thing I did was have Janice and Megan come over. They were in awe that I needed to wear such strong glasses for my first official pair. I could tell that Janice was a bit jealous. She asked if she could try them. I let her wear my second pair. She really liked them. But, since they were a different frame than what she had, she couldn’t wear them without her parents noticing. She reluctantly gave them back to me. 

Over the next week and after school started up again I would notice Janice looking at me. After a couple of weeks, she asked me if she could wear my spare pair during school, then give them back at the end of the day.  I agreed and brought them in the next day. She was so happy. I figured it was a least I could do. After all, it was because of Janice letting me wear her glasses, and her exam tips, that I needed to wear glasses myself.  

This went on for the next 6 months. By that time, I was starting to notice that my glasses weren’t working as well. My mother had already scheduled an appointment for me for Friday afternoon. I told Janice that I would most likely be wearing even stronger glasses soon. She asked if she could wear my second pair at school again. Of course I said yes.  

Friday after school I was back in the chair. Dr. Benson asked me some questions about my vision and started with the exam. After a while, she took me to the waiting area and told my mom that I did need a bit of an increase. My mom asked what my new prescription was. Dr. Benson told her it was up to -4.25. My mother was very concerned. Especially when the doctor told her that I could keep increasing steadily until my 20’s and that my prescription could easily be -10.00 or higher by the time I start Middle School in 5 years. I opted to get new lenses put in my existing frames since I really liked them both. I didn’t tell Janice about my needing stronger lenses because I wanted to surprise her. A few days later, I was proudly wearing -4.25 glasses. I was still just 7 years old, and in about 9 months, I went from having perfect vision to wearing what are possibly the strongest glasses among the students in my school. Janice was excited too since she was the beneficiary of my bad eyesight.

Over the next few years, we all needed some increases. Now that we are all in 6th grade, Janice is now the strongest prescription of the three of us. She is wearing -9.00. Megan is wearing -5.50, and I am at -8.25. Both Janice and I continue to want strong glasses. Megan has seemed to fall out of love with her glasses as they got stronger. I have a feeling she may ask her parents for contacts soon.

By the time we entered high school. Megan has been wearing contacts for about three years, but it was only after a few increases to -7.50. Janice and I are both wearing -10.00 glasses. My mother still opts for the thinnest lens. I don’t mind though. I still know that my glasses are very strong for a 13 year old. 

Over the next several years, we all remained friends. And after years of full time contact lens use Megan was told that she needs to wear her glasses, as she’s no longer able to wear contacts. She too has learned to except her strong glasses. She is up to a -12.00. Janice and I have leveled off in the -15.00 range. Looking back, I’m glad I asked Janice for her glasses. If I didn’t I’m not sure what would have happened. Would I still need them in the future? Either way, I wouldn’t change a thing.

Years later, my parents wear glasses, but only for reading. My brother still doesn’t wear them. My mom still wonders why I am the only one in the family with such bad eyesight. I still think she would be upset if I told her why. So, it will just be our little secret .

Megan, Janice, and I are all married to wonderful guys, and have daughters of our own. Our kids are best of friends, and as expected at age 6, Megan’s girl Amy, and Janice’s girl Sophie needed glasses before starting school. I began to keep an eye on my own daughter Rebecca, to see if she exhibits the same desire for glasses that I did. I might start leaving my first pair out in the open to see if she takes to them. If she wants to wear glasses, I’ll do what I can to help. My husband wears glasses too, so it’s quite possible she’ll eventually wear glasses whether she wants to or not. The option is there waiting for her.

That’s another story!
