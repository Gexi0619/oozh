Back in college I had started my first adventures into GOC. I loved to wear strong plus glasses with bifocals in the library and struggle to see books on the shelf. Sometimes I'd pop a lens out of the frame, struggle blindly to see to put it back in, until a pretty girl nearby would come to help. Sometimes it led to a good conversation, and twice it led to her bedroom.

Perhaps the sexiest encounter occurred in the parking lot at a local college I was taking summer classes at. I had just befriended a good looking girl, strong minus glasses of course, in the cafeteria. We talked for a while about our prescriptions, and it some point she said she'd never seen glasses as strong as mine. (There were my first GOC pair at +20 with an add of +3). I then offered to drive her to her car at another campus nearby, which she gladly accepted. Once there, we exchanged numbers and she exited my car and got into hers. I then flooded the engine, an old carbureted Chevy Malibu and pretended I couldn't get my car started. I popped the hood, struggled to see the engine through my slipping bifocals, pushed them up several times, to no avail. "I can't keep my glasses up to see the engine," I complained. She then offered to hold them up, and I trembled. She pressed against me as she reached around to hold my glasses up. I took the air filter off and cleared the carburetor, then asked her to try to start it. She did. Afterwards she said that glasses as thick as mine really needed to have a strap, as I was constantly pushing them up. I got all hot and she seemed to be interested, but sitting in a very public parking lot, it went nowhere. We did get together later that day and had a fun time.

I used to love struggling to see to fix my broken glasses and have a pretty girl offer to help. I loved it when they made comments about my prescription.Â
