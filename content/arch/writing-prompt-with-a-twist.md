description: Paul's secret collection of prescription glasses is discovered by his new neighbor, leading to an unexpected connection.
---
My name is Paul,I'm 25 years old,I have had many girlfriends but never dated them for more than a few months.
Deep down I knew the sort of girl I wanted but was too shy to tell any of them” 
Today my new neighbour popped in to see me and introduce herself
She was easy to talk to so I asked her for a coffee

My blood froze instantly as I realized too late that my secret would be revealed, and I couldn't stop her anymore. She had just opened the cabinet in my Lounge in which I kept hidden my huge collection of prescription glasses, an undeniable testament to my optical obsession. There was no way I could get away without telling her. I could only wait in dread and apprehension for her reaction.

“What are all these glasses Paul, how did you get them”

“It's my hobby Linda”

“Some men like to collect beer mats or cigarette cards or football programs.
“I like collect to lady's glasses”

“Why don't you just date a girl that wears glasses”

“It's difficult to explain”

“How do you get them Paul”

I went red,Did I admit it was part of the thrill getting them.

“Why are they lined up with pieces of paper under them Paul” 

“Well that shelf has all minus glasse, the front row is the lowest prescription then getting stronger as you get further back”

The next shelf is all plus prescription”

Then this lower shelf has bifocals, they are more difficult to get”

“Al the bottom shelf they have special lens like Myodisc lens or cataract lens 

“O that's cool haha

Linda picked a pair up and read the paper under them.

“Minus 0.75 the library  29 November  2001”

Next she picked a pair up from the next shelf.

“Plus 2 ast 1.50  Costa coffee shop  2002

“What does all that mean Paul do people give than to you”

“Well not exactly”

“You mean you steal them”

I went bright red.

“Do you steal  women's knickers off the washing lines as well, haha

“NO OF COURSE NOT”

“Why don't you find a girl that wears glasses”

I tried to explain that I like to see different prescriptions, and I would never find a girl that wore all these different prescriptions or understood my obsession.

“Ok Paul I'm up for it haha”

“What do you mean Linda”

“Which pair shall I start with today”

My mouth dropped,you mean you want to try them all”

“Yes it sounds fun I've never worn glasses so I will be a new experience for me”

“You won't manage them all.some will be much to strong for you, I suggest you start at the front,

“Is that a bet haha “

Linda looked stunning even in the very low prescription, I did wonder how many different pairs she would manage. Before they got too strong for her, I did know young people have good accommodation  and can manage higher prescriptions that they need.

“Come on Paul shall we go out for coffee”

“But you still have the glasses on” 

“Well if I'm going to try all of those glasses I had better get used to wearing them now haha”
“I think all the girls will be shocked when I go to work tomorrow”
“Don't worry I won't tell them your secret, I will just say I went for a eye test today and was told I needed to wear glasses all the time now”

We had a wonderful day together just  as we were coming out of the book shop Linda saw one of her friends

“Hi Linda you look very different today I never knew you wore glasses they really suit you,

“Thanks June I only got them today. The eye Doctors said I have to wear them all the time and he thinks my eyes will get even worse very quickly so I might need stronger glasses soon. I love them and  I can see much better now”

The fact that Linda had perfect eye sight but was now wearing glasses gave me a even bigger thrill.

We decoverd that we worked very close to each other so we decided we would car share.

“Thank you Paul for a nice time,it's been fun,shall I come around about 8am in the morning”

Linda arrived a little early and I was not ready yet so I told her to sit down and wait for me.

As I came into the room Linda was just closing the glass cabinet doors,
She turned arround and smiled at me.

“I thought I would wear these today,do you like them on me”

I was taken aback.
From the empty space on the self I knew she and picked the glasses with the minus 2.50 lens,I had picked the up at the bookshop years ago when the lady had put her reading glasses on and was looking in the card index

“Are you sure you want to wear them today they are much stronger”

“Yes I'm sure I love the frames, I expect I will get used to them very quickly.it only took about an hour to see perfectly with the pair I tried yesterday.

Everyone was surprised to see Linda arrive at work wearing glasses.One of her co-workers said they looked a lot stronger lens than hers,and seem very high prescription for a first pair.
Linda said she had explained to the Doctor that she had been having a problem seeing,so he wanted to see her again next week.

I had to laugh,was I the Doctor.

Linda must have soon got used to wearing them as I never saw her without them on for the rest of that week.

I invited Linda for lunch on Sunday.she sat down watching the TV while I prepared lunch,

When I came into the room I noticed the cabinet door was not closed properly.

As Linda sat down at the table my legs were shaking 

“What do think of these, do you think blue suits me Paul? They are much stronger power so  I thought I should wear them today to get used to them before I go to work, The paper said minus 5 ast 1.25  what does that mean, I love the retro look.were did you get them from Paul”

“I bought that pair from a charaty shop they are 1960 NHS style”

“I bought them because I saw a photo of my mother wearing blue NHS glasses when she got married”

“O that's SO COOL Can I keep these and have stronger lens put in for my weeding day”

Was she suggesting we go married .

I had to go away for 2 weeks but we spoke every day on Skype, she had the blue glasses on all the time .

As soon as I got home Linda came around,she seemed as pleased to see me as I was her.

“If I'm going to wear these for my weeding day can I put them safe,and choose another pair to wear now”

“Yes you choose while I make lunch”

“What does this mean, Paul the paper says.
Glass lens  Black round 1940 40 style 
R -8.50 ast 3.50 prism out 5 
L- 6.25 ast. 3.00”

“O you can't wear them dear, that lady had very bad eye sight and her right eye 
turned in”

“Please let me keep them on while we have lunch”

When I saw her wearing them my legs went to jelly.

The lens in those days were very basic and made from glass
The extra power of the right lens made the eye look very much smaller and the prism was pulling her eye side ways. 

“Ok dear but just for a while”

She came over and started kissing me.

The next morning when we both woke she still had the glasses on.
I knew I shouldn't let her wear them,but after she had showered and put her makeup on she was still wearing them.

We spent the day in London, I think she was having a little problem with the extra power as she held my hand tight all day. We booked a hotel for the night.
When she was taking her makeup off I could see this big red mark and the deep indentations caused by the weight of the glasses on her nose.

She instenly put the glasses back on

We never spoke about the glasses during the next 2 weeks but her right eye did seem to be straight again now.

Linda came for lunch again on Saturday, the first thing she said was.

Paul the screw is loose in these glasses can I close another pair please

“Ok dear I think the pair next to Where you got them from have the same prescription.

“I like these Paul were they like your mother  wore as well, it says 

“Pink NHS 1970 pink.
R -10.50 ast 4.00 prism out 10
L  - 7.00 ast 3.00

She came into the kitchen 

“Do you like these Paul 

As I turned I dropped the saucepan.

Because they were. NHS glasses they had basic plastic lens in.them.the  thickness of the right lens was incredible and all the prism lines were showing also her right eye was completely turned out 

Before I had time to say anything she dragged me into the lounge,the carpet felt soft and warm, an hour later she said can I keep these glasses on please

The next morning I noticed Lidia was still wearing her glasses in the shower.

We were both very busy for the next 3 weeks so we did not have much time for just talking but I did notice Linda never seems to take her glasses off.
The nights she stayed with me she would wash her face and instantly put her glasses back on before getting into bed.

This weekend we had no work so we decided to go away together.

“I need to ask you something Paul,I don't know what to do I can't really see to read the text on my phone any more, what can I do”

“I Did try to stop you wearing stronger glasses dear , I think it's time you starting wearing bifocals.

“Ok Paul can I choose the pair I can see best in while you load the car”

Linda seemed to be a long time but then she called me.

“Can I have these Paul it says, large 1980s style”
“I like them but the lens seems cracked”

R - 15.75 ast 5.75 prism out 25
L. - 8.25  ast 3.50 
 Add 3.50
Franklin lens 

As she took her glasses off,She had to screw her eyes up to see me, Even though I was only a few feet away from her and the pupil in her right eye had disappeared into the corner.
I could tell now that she was totally dependent on her glasses now.

She looked stunning as she put the large glasses on, the power of the right lens pulled that side of her face in, and the thickness of the lens was fantastic.

I was sure I had found my perfect partner.

“Will you marry me Linda”

“Yes Paul, I thought you were never going to ask me, we were starting to run  out of glasses for me to try”

“But first I have something to show you in my house.

She pointed to the cupboard in the corner.

My blood froze instantly,as she opened the cabinet door in which She kept hidden her huge collection of hearing aids,it was an undeniable testament to her own obsession. They were all sorted just like my glasses collection There were trumpet aids,body worn hearing aids BTE and ITE aids and small modern ones
There was no way She could have got away without telling me.
 I could see the look on her face as she waited in dread and apprehension for my reaction.

She explained that she had always wanted to wear glasses and hearing aids,but never had the courage.

We both left for the weekend wearing glasses and and large BTE  hearing aids

The week before our wedding  day she had been and had her first eye test ,she would not tell me the results 

On our wedding day she looked beautiful, she wearing the blue NHS glasses with her new prescription

R- 25.50  ast - 6.25 prism out 30 
L-10.75   ast - 5.75 
ADD 4.25 

As she got closer to me I could see the cords hanging from the large buttons which she had in her ears,

Today was her first day with a body worn hearing aid

From that day onwards we both wore high powered glasses and hearing aids all the time.
