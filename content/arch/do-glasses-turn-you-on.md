description: "Roommates Leslie and Amy discover the transformative power and allure of glasses, igniting a passionate connection."
---
After graduating from university, where they were room mates for a number of years, Leslie and Amy moved into a nice apartment.
They were very fond of each other , and got along well.
They both had a good job , Leslie worked at a bank, and Amy worked in the office of an insurance company.
They liked their jobs and enjoyed living in a small city, going out and having a good time. They both were members of the health club to stay trim and fit.
At night they would discus the news of the day, and their work and sometimes the people they worked with.
Amy told Leslie that Jennifer came to work to day wearing glasses, and she could not believe how good she looked wearing them.
Her eyes looked brighter behind the lenses, and the frame suited her. She had never looked so good.
Jennifer told Amy her boyfriend loved her new look, she was very happy about that and did not mind having to wear glasses.
Leslie said that she had noticed more people wearing glasses now, and many of them looked very nice wearing them.
But she was not in a hurry to get glasses, she did not think she would look very good wearing glasses and sure did not need them.
Amy was not so sure about that, Leslie had complained about the fuzziness of the T.V. picture and always wanted to sit near the front when going to a movie.
Amy knew her own eyesight was not as good as it had been, she had noticed having more trouble reading road signs when driving.
A few weeks later Amy received a notice in the mail that it was time to renew her driving permit.
When she went to renew, failed the vision test , and was told to come back when she was wearing her glasses.
Amy was not really surprised, but she did not know how she felt about having to wear glasses.
When she was back at the office she mentioned to Jennifer about failing the vision test. Jennifer said that was my problem to, I did not realize my vision had deteriorated that much, until I got my glasses. Would you like to try my glasses, that might give you some idea.
Yes, I would like to, I have no idea what to expect.
When Amy put Jennifer s glasses on and looked around, could not believe the improvement in her eyesight.
Now I realize what wearing glasses can do for you, besides making you see better , they feel nice a kind of sexy.
I better get my eyes examined. Jennifer said you will look great wearing glasses and you will like it.
So Amy made an appointment.
When Amy came home she told Leslie about failing the vision test, and when trying Jennifer s glasses and how well she could see while wearing them.
She also told Leslie she had made an appointment to get her eyes examined.
When the day of the appointment came , Leslie did not want to come.
After the exam,and selecting a nice frame that she really liked , was told to come back in a couple of hours and her glasses would be ready.
When she went to pick up her new glasses and tried them on was very happy with her improved vision, and was pleasantly surprised how good she looked wearing glasses.
When she came home Leslie could not believe her eyes.
She complimented Amy  on how nice and sexy she looked, and asked her if her vision was better now.
Amy said yes I could not believe the improvement, everything is nice and clear.
Here why don't you try them, I think you might like what you can see wearing them.
So Leslie put the glasses on. Yes, you are right, I can t believe it, everything looks brighter and more defined, and they give you 
an exciting feeling. I want to see how I look, and went over to a mirror, looked at herself and said they don t look bad at all.
Leslie said these glasses make me feel sexy, they feel wonderful, and I can see much better, I like them.
Amy told her to get her own , she wanted her glasses back ,I love the felling you get wearing them.
Leslie came over and gave Amy a big hug and said looking at those glasses make me feel sexy, let s go and pleasure each other.
About a week later Leslie was proudly wearing her new glasses, she looked fantastic and she was very proud of them.
Let s go to a bar to night, we wear our glasses , get dressed up, wear our heels and see what kind of reaction we get.
When they entered the bar and found a table, it did not take long for them to be noticed.
The waiter came over and asked them what hey would like, and mentioned that somebody wanted to buy them a drink.
When they asked who the generous person was , the waiter pointed to a couple of good looking guys.
Well if they buy the drinks they might as well join us. 
So they came over and introduced themselves.Jim was dark haired, athletic type with a big smile. His friend Logan  was a blondish type of person with a very pleasant smile , and he wore glasses.
They soon found lots to talk about. The guys told them that they looked so fantastic wearing glasses, that they had to meet them. 
Logan told them he liked wearing glasses and that loved the looks of girls wearing glasses, and was glad to meet them.
Jim told them he was turned on by anybody wearing glasses, and when asked why he did not wear glasses, put his hand in his pocket and pulled out  two glass cases . I cannot make up my ind which pair to wear, I need expert advice.
So the girls asked him to model the frames  and had a hard time deciding which frame they liked best., he looked gorgeous wearing glasses.
Leslie liked Jim he was her kind of guy, lots of fun.
Amy took a shine to Logan, she loved his glasses look, and really liked the looks of his lenses, they showed what looks like some rings.
She asked him about it and he told her he was -5.0 in one and -4.5 in the other eye. When she tried his glasses , realized they were much stronger than hers and could not see very well when wearing them.
Jim asked Leslie if he could try her glasses, and when he did realized their prescriptions were almost identical, so Leslie tried Jim s and realized they could wear each others glasses.The girls enjoyed talking and trying all the glasses, it was exciting, they never had realized glasses could be that much fun, and made you feel so sexy.
They had a great tie together and mad arrangements to meet again.
When the girls came home , Amy said I never would have believed how much fun tit is to wear glasses, and how they turn you on.
Let's go and have some fun while wearing our glasses.
The next time the girls met Jim and Logan, they invited the to their apartment.
They had a nice bottle of wine and some snacks and had a great time The guys suggested to the girls they would like to show them how to kiss properly wearing glasses and how sexy it was when the glasses nearly touched.
The lesson was well received and he even found out how great sex was when wearing glasses and looking at each others eyes through the lenses.
A few days later the girls were discussing their experiences since starting to wear glasses, and realized it was the best thing that had happened to them. They loved wearing glasses, liked the looks of them and they could really turn you on.
They loved to look at all the gals and guys who were wearing glasses, there was nothing nicer when you are bi-sexual.
Yes, GLASSES DO TURN YOU ON.
