The night, I lost my virginity.


My name is Emily, here is my story.


When I was about 5 years old, I remember that day so well, when my aunt and her two daughters came to visit.
What was different this visit, that both girls are wearing glasses now.
Her youngest daughter Pamela, is about my age, and we always play together.
I sure like the looks of them wearing glasses, and when I heard the adults talking, about how cute and grown
up they look wearing glasses, made me wish I had glasses to wear. and be told how cute I looked.


When I asked Pamela, if I could try her glasses, my mother told me, I could not, thatI would 
ruin my eyes, trying her glasses.
After the cousins had left, my mother again told me, she did not want me, to try another persons glasses.
They will ruin your vision, and I hate the looks of children wearing glasses. 
I don’t want you, to ruin your eyes, wearing another persons glasses.


After that visit, I always wished that I could have, my own glasses to wear., I love the look of glasses.




When I went to school, and one of the girls, came to school wearing new glasses, and all the girls tried
the glasses, I did not dare try the glasses, remembering what my mother had told me.


I still liked the looks of glasses, and keep on wishing.


My girlfriend Jenny, started to wear glasses, when we were in the fourth grade.
I loved her new look, and she liked her new glasses, but I never asked to try them, 
but wished I could have my own glasses., just like Jenny.


When I went to high school, and started to pay attention to boys, I really liked one guy, Jason.
He is good looking, and also a member of the football team. 
I would sure like to meet him, and go out with him, I think he is my type.


The next year, Jason, came to school, wearing glasses, .
Wow, he looked fantastic, and now I think I am in love with him, just looking at him, makes me all wet.
He looks so handsome, and desirable.


About a year later, Jason asked me for a date. 
We went to see a movie, and he asked me, where I would like to sit in the front, middle or in the back.
I asked him what he liked, and he told me he liked to sit about half way, so he could see the movie better.
That is when he told me, he thinks, he should have an eye exam, he is sure, that he needs a stronger prescription.


We now date regularly, and enjoy each others company.


About a month later, when Jason and I went to see a movie, he was wearing his new glasses.
He looked so nice, wearing the new glasses, it made me all wet, just looking at him.
I congratulated him on his new look, and that he had made a very good choice of frames, 
that I liked his new look very much.


When we go settled in our seats, Jason said, darn, I forgot to take my old glasses, out of my pocket, 
and the case, is pinching my leg.
I can put them in my purse for you, if you want.
Well, that is a good idea, I don’t need these glasses anymore.
So he handed me the case, and I put the glasses in my purse.
Now, we had less obstruction to do some necking.
I always loved it, when we had such a good time.


After I came home, I started to get ready to go to bed, when I needed to get something out of my purse.
When I opened my purse, there was Jason’s glasses case.
I took the case out, this was the first time, I ever had a glasses case, with real glasses, in my hand.
I became all excited, when I opened the case, and was looking at real glasses
I could not resist the temptation, and took the glasses, out of the case.
Slowly, I looked them over, and could not believe it, me holding a real pair of glasses.
Now, I wondered what I would look like wearing glasses, and would I take a chance, 
I did not want to ruin my eyesight.
O what the heck, I want to wear glasses, wear them.
I put the glasses on, what a nice feeling it was, wearing glasses, so comfortable.
Looking at my self in the mirror, and could not believe, how good I looked wearing glasses.
I sure would like to wear the glasses all the time.
Looking around, I noticed that my vision, when wearing the glasses, was just fine.
I could not believe it, me wearing Jason’s glasses, and be able to see so well,.
Had my mother been right, when she had told me not to wear another person’s glasses?
Well I liked the feel of the glasses, and if my vision had changed, because I wore Jason’s old glasses, 
then I would have my wish, to wear glasses.
I wore the glasses, till I went to bed, and carefully put the glasses on my night table.


The following morning, when I woke up. I noticed the glasses, on my night table.
I got up and put the glasses on, and got that glorious feeling again.
I walked over to the window, and looked out.
Was it my imagination, that everything looked so nice and clear, and that I noticed things, I had not seen before.
When I took the glasses off, I noticed I could not see things as far, as when I had worn the glasses.
Do I need to wear glasses?
When wearing the glasses, I sure could see better.


Now, what to do?
Should I mention it to my mother, that I think I should be wearing glasses ?


When I went to school, all I could think of was how nice it was wearing glasses, and my improved vision,
when wearing the glasses.
Now what to do?


I met Jason for lunch, in the school cafeteria, and after told him, that I had tried his old glasses,
I was sure I could see better when wearing his glasses,
What shall I do, my mother hates the looks of glasses.


Jason, would you mind it, I if I wear glasses?
No, if you need to wear glasses, wear them, I am sure you will look as beautiful as you do now.
Thank you Jason, I feel much better now.


Emily, I have a suggestion, the next time we go, and see a movie, we are going to sit in the back rows
and then, when you bring my old glasses, and then  when  you wear the glasses, and take the glasses of, 
we can find out, if you need to wear glasses.
Yes, that sounds like a good idea.


In the mean time, I wore the glasses, whenever I had a chance, I loved wearing them, and could
not wait for our next date.


When Jason picked me up for our date, I put the glasses on, as soon as I sat down in the car.
How do I look?
Emily, I love your glasses wearing look, with the right frame, you will look even more fantastic.


After we were seated, and the movie started, I knew, right away, that I need to wear glasses, 
after wearing and removing the glasses.
Jason let me try his glasses, and was very surprised, I had no trouble seeing, when wearing his new stronger 
prescription glasses.
He told me his new prescription was only a little bit stronger than his old glasses, my prescription was -1.50
in my old glasses and my new ones, are up to -2.00.
Then he explained to me, about the minus, and plus lenses.

Well Emily, when am I going to see you wearing your new glasses?
I, don’t know, how to tell my mother, she will tell me, it is my own fault, that I have to wear glasses,
because of wearing your glasses, I have ruined my eye sight.
Well you know that is not true,
A persons vision can change, with age, and the amount of close work you do, and I know you always like
to sit near the front of the class, that is why you have not really noticed, your deteriorating eyesight. 


I wore the glasses going home, and they were so comfortable, that I forgot about wearing the glasses, 
when walked into our house.


Emily, what is going on, why are you wearing glasses?


So, I told my parents, about trying Jason’s old glasses, during the movie, and noticing that I could see 
so much better, when wearing the glasses, so he let me wear his old glasses.
That is why I am wearing the glasses, now I know, that I have to have an eye exam, and find out,
what prescription I need.


My dad said, that sounds like a good idea, we will make an appointment for you.


During my eye appointment, the doctor asked me, why I had waited this long, to have an eye exam?
I told him, that I always sat near the front of the class, and had never noticed, that when looking in the distance.,
I could not see, what I was supposed to see, until I tried my boy friends glasses.
That is why In am here.
Well you are right, you sure need to wear glasses , full time, I will give you your prescription, and don’t forget
to wear your glasses, and I want to see you again in about 6 to 8 months.


When I sat down with the optician, she showed me the my right eye was – 2.00 and my left one -2..25,
which was fairly high for a first prescription.


With the help of the optician, I selected, a real nice frame, that will blend so nice with my hair,
and skin tone.




When, I went to get my glasses, they were ready, and after I put them on, and looked around,
Now, I know, how poor my eyesight is, there is a whole new world around me.
I can see everything clearly now.
I loved my new look, wait till Jason sees me.




When I came home, proudly wearing my new glasses, the first thing my mother said, 
I hope, you are not going to wear those glasses all the time.
Yes mother I am, the eye doctor told me I need to wear the glasses all the time


When Jason saw me, wearing my new glasses, I noticed the front of his pants looked different.
He loves my new look so much, that that night, we had a great time together, and I lost my virginity.
