description: In a desperate attempt to hide his poor vision, President Trump must make a choice, wear glasses or risk it all.
---
I decided to write a story on chatgpt. I cleaned it up a bit. 

Donald Trump had always been proud of his appearance, and his image was carefully curated to project an image of wealth, power, and success. However, what most people didn't know was that he had a secret - poor eyesight. Despite this, he refused to wear glasses in public, afraid of how it might affect the carefully constructed persona he had created for himself.

For years, Trump managed to keep his secret under wraps. He would squint and strain his eyes during meetings and public appearances. However, as he got older, his vision continued to deteriorate, and he found it increasingly difficult to read even the largest of font sizes.

Still, he resisted wearing glasses in public, worried that they would make him appear weak or vulnerable. He constantly wore contact lenses until his eyes got too dry to tolerate them. For a while he tried to go without him, but he realized he was bumping into people. He reluctantly started wearing his glasses. 

A tabloid newspaper quickly caught wind of Trump's secret, and the next day, the headline screamed, "TRUMP'S SECRET GLASSES: THICK LENSES REVEAL POOR VISION." The article went on to describe in lurid detail just how thick Trump's glasses were, and how they revealed just how poor his vision had become.

"Sources close to the president have revealed that he has been secretly wearing glasses to correct his vision for years," the article began. "However, what is truly shocking is just how thick the lenses are. According to our sources, Trump's vision has deteriorated to the point where he needs some of the thickest lenses on the market just to see clearly."

The article went on to speculate that Trump had been hiding his glasses because he viewed them as a sign of weakness. "This is a man who prides himself on his image and his appearance," the article read. "He has gone to great lengths to project an image of power, wealth, and success, and he likely viewed glasses as something that would detract from that image."

Trump was mortified, and the news took a toll on him. He began to feel like he had been caught with his pants down. The next time he appeared in public, Trump couldn't help but feel self-conscious. His glasses were thick, revealing just how poor his eyesight had become. He was used to being in control, but now he felt vulnerable and exposed.

Despite his embarrassment, Trump knew he needed to wear his glasses. It was either that or risk making a costly mistake due to his failing eyesight. The thickness of Trump's glasses was immediately apparent to anyone who saw him wearing them. They protruded noticeably from the frames, distorting his eyes and face.

As Trump began to wear his glasses in public more frequently, people began to take notice. Some praised him for being willing to admit that he had a vision problem and for taking steps to correct it. Others mocked him, calling him "four eyes" and questioning his fitness for office.

In the end, Trump eventually became more indifferent to the fact that he wore glasses. The thick lenses gave him an air of intellectualism and seriousness, that he didn’t have before.

One thing I don’t like about chatgpt is that it always makes glasses a “signature look” whenever I make it write a story about someone who’s embarrassed to wear glasses. I don’t think that normally happens. I think it’s more realistic to just become indifferent to them.
