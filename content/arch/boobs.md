Boobs.


Yes, boobs, is my nick name, and I was called that name, going to high school, thanks to my younger brother, who for some reason, has a dislike for me, and never has been, like a normal brother should be.
I know, my father, did not like me, since the day I was born, because, he wanted a boy,
He was very old fashioned, and never showed any respect, or real liking for a women,.not even his wife !
His marriage, to my mother had been arranged, by my grandparents, to close a deal.
My mother, is a very quiet, pleasant woman, who does, what she has been told to do.


When, I was about a year old, my brother James was born, so we grew up together, but he always, was bossy, and with my father's encouragement, soon became a real bully. 
We live on a farm, near a small hamlet, where we go to church, and school, which, is the centre of all our community activities.


At a young age, I started to do chores, around the farm,.
I love the farm, and all the animals, and working in our garden, and the barn.
When, I started, to go to school, I became friends, with Amy, the daughter of 
what my father called. a rich man, who lived in a large house, with a two car garage.
Amy, is a very pretty, and pleasant person, and is like a sister to me.
I liked going to school, and was a good student.
A few years later the school was closed, and we went to school in the city, by bus, Amy, and I always sit together.


The summer, before I went to high school, I really grew, and started to develop, and change into a woman. 
Amy , who is very fashion conscious, was a big help, making me look good., she, taught me how to do make up, and to do my hair, to improve my looks.


I was the young farmer, my father wanted my brother to be, and I did some of the chores, everyday before, and after school. 
My brother did not like farm work, one reason why he did not do much., he was lazy.


Riding on the bus, and talking to Amy, made the 45 minute ride to and from school, more enjoyable.
To day, going to school, Amy told me, she had an eye exam , and was prescribed to wear glasses, and told me that, because, she was having trouble, seeing far away objects clear, When not sitting in the front of the class, she had trouble, to read what was written on the blackboard. 
Amy is really looking forward, to get her new glasses,.
I have noticed, quite a number of students wearing glasses, and how nice they look, and 
wonder, how Amy will look wearing glasses.


A couple of days later, Amy came on the bus, wearing her new glasses, the colour, and shape of the frame, made her look, fantastic, and she received many compliments, except from my brother, who made some nasty comments.
Amy, then told me, how the glasses, have improved her vision, and loves the way she looks, wearing glasses.
When she let me try her glasses, I could not believe, how nice and clear, everything looked, Amy told me, that I look great wearing glasses.
Now I wonder, do I need to wear glasses.
I found that out, when after the summer, I went back to school.


During the summer, with all the hard work, around the farm, I grew some more, and I now have a large bust, beautiful long hair, and a healthy look..
That is the time, when my brother, started calling me Boobs, which my father thought was funny, and soon both of them, used it regularly, instead of Amber, my real name. 


When we went back to school after the summer, Amy, was now wearing new glasses.
She had an increase in her prescription, at her 6 month exam..
She sure looks good wearing glasses, and I had a chance to try her glasses again.
Looking out of the window, with and without wearing the glasses, I realized, that I see much better, when wearing the glasses.
Amber, why don't you go for an eye exam, it looks to me, perhaps, you should be wearing glasses to.
When, I told my parents that night about the glasses, my dad told me to forget about it.
I did not need to wear glasses, when milking cows.


About a month later, I had more trouble reading, what was written on the blackboard, and now, had frequent headaches.
Amy, the sweet girl she is, noticed it, and brought her old glasses, for me to use.
What a pleasure, to be able to see better, I loved it, and soon wore the glasses, from the time I got on the bus, till I arrived home in the afternoon.
Off course, my brother made a big deal out of it, and my parents wanted to know all about me wearing glasses.
My dad told me, he did not want to see me, wear the glasses.


Now every time, Amy started to wear new glasses, I did to, because she would give me her old pair of glasses to wear.
During my last year of high school, I was wearing, -3.00 glasses, and now I am very uncomfortable not wearing my glasses.


My dad bought, my brother a car, so he could have some fun, but, he won't buy me a proper pair of glasses, something is no right.




At the school on Friday night, we were going to have a big dance.
Amy and I were wearing our best dresses, and with some make up, looked fantastic.
I wanted be comfortable, so I wore my glasses.
During the dance, both Amy and I had a lot of dances, and we had a great time.
The big surprise was, when my brother, brought me a drink, he never before, has done anything like that. being nice to me?
After finishing the drink, and a few more dances, I started to feel, very uncomfortable and hot.
I told Amy, that I was going outside, to get some fresh air.
When I found a place to sit down, somebody, came and pushed me down.
He did not realize, he tried to rape a big farm girl, and had a hard time pinning me down, but he soon had some helpers, and they had a wonderful time, raping me.
I could not make a sound, because one of the guys held a cloth over my mouth, and I passed out.
After they were finished, left me lying there. my clothes torn, my glasses broke, I was a mess.
Amy, wondering what happened to me, went outside, and found me, waking up out of my stupor, all upset and crying.
Amy, the good friend she is, phoned her dad, who came to the school, to drive us home .
We went to Amy"s place to get me, cleaned up. 
Her father, and mother were so nice and comforting to me.
Amy's mother, phoned my mother to tell her, I was spending the night at their place, because Amber had a little problem, and needed some rest. 


When, my parents asked my brother the next day, if he knew, what had happened, he told them, yes, she was having sex, with some guy.


When I came home, my dad was ready to hit me, about having sex, and not being home to do my chores.
I told my mother, that I had been raped, after somebody had spiked my drink.
That is all, that was said, until a couple of months later, when I realized, I was pregnant.
I knew, my brother was involved, with handing me a spiked drink, I should have known better, that was the only time ever, that I can remember, him being nice to me.


Amy, as always, was like a good sister to me, and, to day gave me one of her current glasses, she had bought on a 2 for 1 deal, so now we both wear, identical prescriptions, and my vision is better than ever.


When, my dad found out, that I was pregnant, told me I had to marry the guy, and when I told him I did not know, who had made me pregnant, called me a slut,.
I had not returned to school, after the rape incident, and I never graduated, thanks to my brother.


My brother bought another car, I am pretty sure, he is selling drugs, because I have no idea , where all that money is coming from, and have a feeling my dad is involved to.
They go out together, more often, and leave me with all the farm work.


I work, all day, helping my dad on the farm, or my mother in the house..
After quitting school, I had started to wear my glasses all day long, at home, and I noticed that my vision is deteriorating again, I wonder if it is, because of me being pregnant.
I talked to my mother, and with her help, now have enough money for an eye exam, and new glasses , because I need to wear my glasses to see properly, and I am now so used to wearing glasses, they now, are part of me.
I have been wearing glasses, for more than four years, and now will be going for my very first eye exam, next week.


At the exam, and, I had told the optometrist, my history, of wearing glasses.
After the exam, when handing me my prescription, she mentioned, how fortunate I was, to have almost identical, cylinder and axis measurements, as the glasses, I had been wearing.
Your prescription, is - 5.50 now, and most likely, will stay there, after you have given birth.
Then I selected a frame, that I really liked, for my own first pair glasses.
The optician, fitted the frame, and my new glasses, will be send to me, by mail, as soon as they are ready.


As promised, the mailman, delivered my glasses a few days later, 
Now, wearing my new glasses, my vision is so much better, and I love the looks of my new frame, and the lenses, that show some depth, and rings.




Chapter 2




My dad told me, he would not be helping, to do the chores, because, he is going out, with my brother, to run some errands.


I did the chores, while the baby inside of me kept moving, as if it was helping me, to get the work done.
Going, into the house for our evening meal, I noticed a police cruiser, parked in the drive way.
I entered the kitchen, where two policemen, were talking to my mother, while she was, dabbing her eyes with a tissue.
They, told me, that both my father, and brother, had been killed , when my brother tried to out run the police, who, had asked him to stop. 
Next, they searched the house, and barn, for drugs and drug money, but could not find any, and figured all the items they were looking for might be in the car.


Now, I have my hands full, eight month pregnant, and a farm to run.
My mother, is a changed person, she is full of life, and now, is the mother I had always wanted, and worked right along with me.


A few weeks later, I became the mother of a beautiful baby girl, and we named her Vicky, and Amy will be her god mother, my mother is so happy, now she has a grand child, and loves to look after her, while I do the farm work.


A few weeks later, a fertilizer, and seed sales man, came to see us, to find out what, we might need.,for the coming season.
He was a very, pleasant young man, in his early twenties, and told us that Trevor, was his name. 
I invited him in, and after he sat down, we had some very pleasant conversation.
A little later, he asked me, if my husband was home, so he could talk to him. 
I run the farm, with my mother, and we do not have a husband.
Sorry, I asked, have you any plans, of what you might need, in seed and fertilizer?
No, not at present, but I think, we need some soil tests done, to find out what we might need.
I can do that for you, and when we get the results, we can discus your needs.
Looking at Trevor, I started to feel wet, between my legs, I liked that guy.
When I saw Trevor out, we kept on talking, and me not paying attention, where I was going, stumbled, and twisted my ankle.
Trevor, helped me get up, and assisted me back into the house, and suggested, he drive me to the emergency department, at the hospital


After an X ray had been taken, my ankle was bandaged, and I was told, I had a bad strain, and to rest the leg, for a few days.
Trevor, suggested, that if I did not mind, he would look after the farm for me, until I was better again.
Will you really? 
Yes, but I have to go home first, to get some work clothes, and my glasses, because I don't want to work in a barn, wearing my contact lenses.
I tried to visualize, what Trevor would look like wearing glasses.


Trevor's, mother came to talk to me, while I was waiting in Trevor's car, a very pleasant, high myopic, glasses wearing lady, to tell me to look after her boy, she must have noticed, that I really like Trevor.
Trevor, came back, and threw his clothes in the back seat, and handed me a glasses case, and asked me to put it in the glove box. 
After he kissed his mother, and told her not to worry about him, sat down, and started the engine.
I asked him, if I could look at his glasses?
Yes, go ahead.
I opened the case , and looked at a very nice looking plastic frame, with strong minus lenses,. 
Amber, they are -7.50, a bit stronger then yours, you can try them, if you want to.
I put the glasses on, and tried to look around, but they were a little too strong for me.
Amber, you look so nice wearing my glasses, I love your look, with stronger lenses. 
Trevor, you must like the looks of glasses? 
Yes I do, the stronger the nicer, you saw my mother's glasses, minus 14.00, they look so beautiful, her being high myopic, is most likely, why our whole family, is myopic.


When we came home, Trevor, held me close, when we entered the house, a wonderful feeling, the only problem is my panties are all wet, what has come over me?
After Trevor had removed his contact lenses, and put his glasses on, and I had a good look at him, almost fainted, wow, he looked fantastic, he is beautiful.
The next few days, I just could not wait, for Trevor, to come to the house, after the farm work, so I could look at him again. and seeing his beautiful, high myopic, glasses wearing face..
I think, I am in love.
About three days, after my fall, I was able to walk pretty good, without to much pain.
That night, Trevor assisted me to get to my bedroom, and when, we stood beside the bed, and he was ready to leave me, I told him he had not kissed me goodnight,
All I heard was, well.........., and he kissed me, I never had experienced a kiss like that before, while all the time looking at his eyes, behind the strong lenses.
After another kiss, he told me I looked beautiful, and went to his bedroom.
I put my night gown on, and climbed into my bed, but could not get to sleep.
All I could think of, was Trevor and his beautiful face,
Laying awake to long, I got up, and slowly, walked to the bedroom, where Travis was.
The moonlight, shining through the windows, gave me enough light to see where I was going,
Because he was sleeping, in a big bed, I slowly slid, into the bed, and snuggled up beside him., and started to play with his member, which responded fast.
Trevor woke up, is that you Amber , yes, I could not sleep, and want to be with you, I love you.
I love you to, and he put his arm around me, and put his hands on my breast, and slowly massaged it, you have some nice breasts, yes, I know, that is why both my brother, and father, called me, BOOBS.
