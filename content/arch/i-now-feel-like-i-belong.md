description: Glasses became a symbol of belonging and acceptance in a young girl's family, but she's the outsider.

At last, I feel like I belong.




Being the youngest girl in our family, certainly has some advantages.
I always listen to my sisters, Jenny, who is 12, and Amber who is 10 years old.
when they are talking about, training bras, make up and boys, so I will know all about it, 
when I get to be their age.
My name is Angie, and I am 8 years old and in grade three.




Both my parents wear glasses, the type, that make your eyes look smaller, and if you look at the edge of the lenses,
makes everything in the distance looks further away and smaller, I heard my sisters say that they are myopic.
I don’t know yet what that means but I am sure, I will find out.




At our school, we have yearly vision screening.
The other day, I heard my sisters talking about the eye test at school, and that it was easy to beat.
The letters you have to read are always the same, so all you have to do is remember them.
They mentioned, that it was called a Snellen chart, and they know all the letters by heart, 
because, they need to, but do not want to wear glasses.
I have heard Jenny say, that she now sits in the front of the class room, so she can read, what is on the white board.
Amber mentioned, that she had to move forward, so she could read what was written on the board.
I have no problem, I like to sit in the back of the room.
Now I wonder, what will happen at the next vision screening, that we are going to have next week.
My sisters are not worried, they are so confident, that they can remember all the letters, and pass the test.

Good morning, I am Nicole Peters, the optician.
Glad to meet you, I am the school principal.
I expect you, are here do the vision screening.
Yes, and this year, the screening will be different, than the screening we have done in the past few years.
We won’t be using the eye chart anymore.
This year I will be using, a hand held auto refractor, which will tell us, the health of the eye,,
and the sphere, axis, and astigmatism.
At the end we get a printout, and the whole procedure, takes less then two minutes
The print out we can use, so we can notify the parents, about the health of the child’s eyes,
When we notice, that the child, has a vision problem, we can suggest that their child, should have an eye exam.
I like the new procedure, because of all the information we now have available.
To day, I would like to do grade one , two ,and three,
and I will be back next week for the next three grades.




After Dr,. peters tested the grades, 1 2 and 3, she handed a chart, with each child’s name, to the secretary, 
so the school, could pass the information, about the eye screening to the parents.

Angie came home to day, and handed her mother the envelope, with the results of the eye screening.
Well I am glad to notice, that your vision, and eye health is good
Jenny and Amber wanted to know how the test was done, what no eye chart?
So I told my sisters, nothing to worry about, the Doctor holds a what looks, like a camera that you look at,
and a piece of paper comes out of the little machine, and the test is finished. 
I don’t know why, but both my sisters are looking very worried.






Jenny and Amber had their eye test to day, and bragged about it. 
That was easy, when they handed my mother the envelopes, with the test results.
My mother, looked surprised, that the test results had shown, that both Amber and Jenny might be myopic,
and should have an eye exam.
Well, I better make some eye appointments for you girls, so you can get your glasses.
We don’t need glasses!! 
Yes, you do, your eye test showed, that both you girls are myopic.




Amber and Jenny had their eye exams, and both have to wear glasses now.
Now, everybody in our family wears glasses, but me.
It makes me feel like a misfit.




I am in my second year of high school now, and not wearing glasses, like the rest of the family.
After trying my sisters old glasses, I gave up. 
When I wore their old glasses, I liked, how I looked wearing glasses, and I want to wear glasses,
But I get a headache, every time I wear my sisters old glasses, so I am giving up.
I guess, no glasses for me.
Looking around at school, I almost feel out of place, because more than half of the students are wearing glasses now, 
and I wonder how many, are wearing contact lenses.


To day, my closest girlfriend Nicole, came to school wearing glasses.
I complimented her, how nice she looked wearing glasses.
Angie, I never expected to be wearing glasses, but my brother had to have an eye exam, so my mother
made sure, I had an eye exam to, and we could not believe, when I was told I needed to wear glasses .
I was sure my vision was perfect, that was the end of our conversation, for now., because classes started.




The big football game is to day, and all the students are ready to root for the home team.
When Nicole and I came to the stadium, we ended up sitting in the top row of seats. 
After the players came to the field, I noticed, that they all looked like fuzzy little statues, 
and I could not read the number on the back of their shirts.
When I told Nicole, about it, she said I have no problem, I can see everything just fine.
I am glad, I am wearing glasses now, because when I take the glasses of, I have the same vision problem.
Angie, I think you need to wear glasses, here try my glasses.
After I put Nicole’s glasses on, realized I am now myopic, and should be wearing glasses .
During the game, Nicole let me try her glasses sometimes, and l loved to be able to see, the players, and their numbers.
I am so happy, I cannot wait to get home, to tell my mother, that I need an eye exam, and need to wear glasses.


I was so excited, on the day, I had my eye exam.
After the doctor finished the exam, it was like music to my ears, when the doctor said, 
Angie you are myopic now, and have to wear glasses.
What fun I had, selecting a frame that I liked, and now I cannot wait for my glasses to be ready




The next day, I went to get my glasses, after I put them on, I felt like a whole new person.
I was so happy with the clarity, of my vision, and when I looked at myself, liked what I saw, 
Loving my new glasses wearing look. I kept looking at myself, when I had the chance.
Now, I feel very confident, and wearing the glasses, makes me feel as if I belong. 


I have noticed, that since I started to wear glasses, more of the boys are looking at me.
I love the attention, and going on dates.
How lucky I am, to be noticed and to feel important,
At last I feel as if I belong to our family, and a good looking glasses wearing girl,
who is now noticed.
