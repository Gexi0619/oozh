Peter, got his wish.


From, a very early age, I have, always liked the looks, of glasses.
Nobody, in our family, wears glasses, except my grandparents, they do, but all old people wear glasses.
When, I was in grade two, my teacher, wore the nicest glasses, I had ever seen,, and, I sure liked the looks of those glasses.
Her glasses, when, you looked a face, made her face look narrower, and the lenses, showed, a lot of rings, and made her eyes look smaller, I liked that. 
I like, to have to wear glasses, like that someday.
.
The summer holidays, have just started, and I miss my friend Jimmie, who had lived next door.
When I was playing in our yard to day, noticed that a new family is moving into the house next door.
I hope, they have a boy, about my age, I can sure use a new friend, after Jimmy's family moved, to another town. 
While, keeping a close eye, on the movers next door, I did not see, anything interesting, until a car drove in.
When, the doors of the car, opened, a lady, and three girls, came out of the car, and went into the house, I could not believe it, they all wore glasses.
Then, another car came, and a glasses wearing girl, about my age, and I guess her dad, went into the house., no boys, no new friends
The only thing, I , really noticed was, they all wore glasses.


The next day, when I was ready, to go for a bike ride, the young girl from next door, came over to me, she wanted to know, if I would mind, if she came along,
and show her some of the neighbourhood, and where the school is.
I had a real good look at her, and she wears the kind of glasses, that I like, she certainly, is a pretty girl.
That will be a pleasure, my name is Peter, come along.
I am , Cindy, I am ready, let's go, and you can show me the neighbourhood.. 
After showing her the school and other places, we came past the ball diamond, a couple of the guys were there., throwing a ball.
Cindy said, great, let's play ball.
We played ball, and the surprise, to all of us was, she can, pitch, hit, and she can run as fast, as any of us.
On the way home, she said, well, Peter, what are we going to do to morrow?
I wished, she was a boy, she sure would make a great friend.


The next day, we rode our bikes, to the woods, we stopped, and sat on a bench, and had our snacks.
I looked at Cindy's nice, glasses wearing face, and slowly asked her,
Cindy, what is it like to wear glasses?
Glasses, are no trouble to wear, once you are used to wearing them, you forget you are wearing them, I don't mind wearing them, they are comfortable, and wearing the glasses, gives me perfect vision.
Well, Cindy, I, have always, liked the looks of glasses, and I am sure, would like to wear glasses, with the type of lens you have in your glasses.
Can , I try your glasses, to see, what it is like wearing glasses?
Sure, here they are, give my glasses a try, I have a feeling, that my prescription, is to strong for you, this is my second pair of glasses, I started to wear them about this time last year.
So, I tried the glasses, and told Cindy she was right, I could not see to well, but I sure liked the feeling of the glasses on my face.
Peter, you look very nice, wearing glasses, I really like that look, you would look so good, wearing glasses.


The next day, we played ball again, in the morning, and went for our bike ride in the afternoon.
Cindy told me, she would like to go, the woods again, she had brought along some bread, to feed the squirrels.
When, we sat on the bench, to feed the squirrels, Cindy handed me, a glasses case.
Peter, you like to wear glasses for myopia,, try these glasses, I am sure, you will be able to see much better, wearing these glasses.
Those, are my first pair of glasses, and as you notice, I like, brown, plastic frames.
After, I put the glasses on, and looked around, and was really surprised, how well I could see, everything I looked at, looked so nice and clear.
Cindy, these glasses are fantastic, I can see real good, when wearing these glasses.
Well. I think, you should wear glasses, all the time, I love it, the way you look wearing glasses.
I really liked wearing the glasses, and noticed,, that after wearing the glasses, for a while. my vision was perfect, everything, looked so nice and clear, now I would like to know, what do I look like wearing glasses?
I sure, would not mind, to wear glasses like these, all the time.
Cindy suggested, I wear the glasses all the way home.
What a fantastic feeling, riding my bike, wearing glasses, I love it.


Cindy, told me, you can keep the glasses, but, when we are together, you have to wear the glasses.
That night, in my room, wearing the glasses, was the first time, I had a chance, to look at my self, to see what I looked like wearing glasses.
I, had to agree, I look good, wearing glasses, and what I like best, the lenses, in the glasses, are my favourite kind..


The next morning, before we went to play ball, Cindy's mother wanted to see me.
When I met her, she looked me over, and, thanked me, for being a friend with Cindy, I expect, that when she goes to school, after the summer break, she will find some girl friends.
While listening to her, I looked at her glasses, and at the smaller eyes, behind the strong lenses, they looked just like the glasses, our second grade teacher wore.
I also, met Cindy's two sisters, and noticed, their stronger lenses.
When, we were on our way, to the ball field, Cindy, told me, it was time to put the glasses on, remember, when you are with me, you have to wear the glasses. because, you look so nice, I like to see you wearing them, and you like wearing glasses.
I put the glasses on, and sure, enjoyed wearing them again.
When, the other guys, saw me wearing glasses, never had a chance to say anything, Cindy, told them, that I needed to wear glasses, and let's play ball.
I still ,cannot believe, how much better, I can see now, when wearing the glasses, and I sure like wearing them.


About a couple of weeks later, when my eyes, were used, to wearing the glasses,
Cindy showed up, wearing new glasses, the frames are still dark brown, but the shape of the lenses, is slightly different, and so are the lenses, they certainly look stronger, and more interesting.
I, complimented her, and told her, hownice she looks, and that I like the looks, of her stronger lenses.
She told me, she loves her new glasses.
Then, she said, Peter take your glasses off, so I did.
Now, I now, want you, to wear these glasses, and I will, take your old ones.
When, I put them on, noticed quite a difference, they were her, last pair, and sure had a stronger prescription.
After I , put the glasses on, was really surprised, how well, I now could see now, wearing them..
I am sure, if you you wear, these glasses all the time, you will soon notice, the change in you vision, when you don't wear the glasses.
Then, you will be ready, for an eye exam, and you will get your own glasses


The following day, the weather was cloudy, and Cindy suggested, we go to the mall.
Before, we were very far from home,, Cindy told me, to put the glasses on.
When, we arrived at the mall, after looking around, Cindy, suggested we go to the optical store, she wants me, to try some frames, to see, what frame, I should get when you get your own glasses. 
It was fun, trying all the different frames, and after a while, we both decided, which frame, I should get, after my eye exam.
I, now have perfect vision wearing Cindy's stronger glasses, and I have tried Cindy's new glasses, a few times, and was surprised how well, I could see, when wearing her new glasses.


What, I have noticed lately, that when, I am not wearing the glasses, my distant vision, is very hazy,.
I have looked ,out of my bedroom window, with and without wearing the glasses, and now, am sure, I need to wear the glasses, to see anything far away.
I hope, that I will soon, be getting, my own glasses.


About, two weeks, before school started, Cindy was over at our house, talking to y mother, who. complimented her how nice she looks wearing glasses, and then asked her, how she had found out, she needed to wear glasses.
Well, my mother insists, that we all have an eye exam, every year, to check, on the health of our eyes, as well as our vision, that is how, you find out, if you need to wear glasses, every young person needs an eye exam, every year.
When was Peter's last eye exam?
When, he was, about four years old,
Well, that is a long time ago, perhaps, Peter should have an eye exam now, before he goes back to school. 
I, have noticed, that he shows, some signs, that he might be myopic, that means, he might be near sighted, and should be wearing glasses.
Well, I did not realize that, I will, have to discuss that, with my husband, to night.
Where, do you go, to have your eyes examined?
I had it, done at the optical store in the mall, and they also have a good collection of frames.


The next day, Peter's mother, made an appointment, for his eye exam, for the day after to morrow.
Cindy, who, as far as my mother is concerned, has a lot of experience, about vision and glasses, was asked to come along..
Peter's mother, went into the examination room, with Peter., when he had his eye exam.
Cindy, in the mean time, talked to the optician, and showed her the frame, that Peter really liked.
Peter's mother, was a little upset, that her son was prescribed to wear glasses., she certainly, had not expected that.
The frame selection, did not take very long, because the optician showed us the frame, that we previously had selected, and when Peter tried it on, everybody, liked it.
A little over, an hour later, Peter was wearing his own glasses, with the kind of lenses he liked.
Peter, has his wish, he is now, wearing glasses for myopia, thanks, to a smart, glasses wearing, neighbour girl.
