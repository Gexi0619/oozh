description: "When a chemistry experiment causes a myopia epidemic, everyone in town starts wearing glasses - with unexpected consequences."

I got my wish.


I want to wear glasses.
Why? I love the idea not to be able to see far away objects clear, 
and when wearing the glasses, to be able to see everything perfect, 
be able to change you vision, whenever you want .
I love the looks of glasses, and how they feature a persons eyes.
Everybody, should wear glasses, that is my opinion




I am a second year student at our high school, and have two younger sisters.
Using my computer, I have learned a lot about vision, lenses and I also love chemistry.
My birthday present, that my parents gave me, is chemistry set .
Now, I try all kinds of experiments, and really enjoy, all the results.




I am bored with experiments, described in the book that came with my chemistry set,
now I do some experiments that are different, I keep track of all the chemicals, and measurements, 
in case, I discover something worthwhile.




To day, my mother asked me to take some stuff, and put it in the trash can.
I noticed that there was a little vaporizer, that my mother must have used, when spraying perfume.
That might come in handy some time, so I put it in my pocket.




I was mixing another combination of chemicals, and wondered if it was going to be what I expected.
What I was trying to create, was an air freshener.
Filling the atomizer with the solution, I sprayed some around the room, just at the time, 
that my sister walked in, and told me lunch was ready.




While having my lunch, I felt a slight discomfort in my eyes, and rubbed them a little,
I noticed, my sister, also rubbed her eyes.
What ever caused the discomfort, did not last, and my eyes felt fine.




About 10 days later, I noticed, my distance vision, was not as good as it had been.
Am I becoming myopic, I would love that.
My vision became noticeable worse, during the next couple of weeks,
That night at mealtime, my sister told our parents, that she should have another eye exam, 
She told my parents, that she had trouble reading, what was written on the white board.
I can t believe it, said my mother, all you children, had an eye exam about 3 months ago.
Well, I have the same problem.
O K. I will make an appointment for both of you.




We both were prescribed to wear glasses, the strange thing was, we had an identical prescription which read, â€“ 2 .50.
Now I am wondering, was it my, so called air freshener, that caused our myopia?
I remember that, after I sprayed my room, my sister had walked in.
Now I have to find out for sure, if it is my air freshener.




I filled the atomizer, and put it in my pocket.
At school, I noticed a group of girls talking, so I sprayed some solution, in the air.
In the hall way, just before the next class, I sprayed a group of guys.
What I did not realize was, that the fine little droplets were sucked into the air ventilation system, 
and went through the whole school. 




About four weeks later I noticed, that everyday, a few more students, came to school, now wearing glasses .
Now I am sure, my solution is not air freshener, but causes myopia. 




When all of a sudden, so many young people start to wear glasses, a lot of parents were very concerned.
The principal, of the high school, did not have any answer, what might have caused the myopia epidemic.
The whole school building was sanitized, and nobody knew what else to do.






I had a great time at the next school dance, all those nice glasses wearing girls, to dance with, what a pleasure.
I still cannot believe, that the solution, was so good., and had my wish, of everybody wearing glasses. 




All the optometrists and eye doctors in our town, had a meeting at the University Optical Department, to discuss the myopia issue.
They all had noticed, that every prescription read, -2.50, and they had also, noticed that the elongation, of the eyeball,
is slightly different, from what it usually is, and that there were no contact lenses available at present, that the patients could wear.
A lot of discussion, and no answers.




To day, going to the shopping mall, realized I had the atomizer, still in my pocket.
There was some solution left, and without realizing what I did, emptied the container.




A few weeks later, in the local paper, was an article about customers, and staff, in the mall becoming myopic.
That all the optometrists, could not get over the fact, that all the prescriptions were the same, -2.50 
On the news that night, I heard that the police is now investigating, about what had happened at the mall.
I never realized how good, my recipe worked, but what to do with it.
Being sure nobody would want it, I decided, I better get rid of it.
I broke the glass on the atomizer, before I threw it in the garbage, and cut the recipe paper in little pieces,
and flushed half of it down the toilet and the rest went in the garbage, so nobody could trace it


Now I can relax, and enjoy looking at all those nice people wearing, -2.50 prescription glasses.
I would never have believed, that my wish ,of almost everybody wearing glasses, was here, for me to enjoy.
