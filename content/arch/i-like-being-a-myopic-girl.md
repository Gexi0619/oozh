description: A young girl discovers the power of glasses after borrowing her friend's and transforms her vision.
---
My name is Jennifer ,I am 7 years old.
I have a friend , her name is Ashley , she has beautiful curly hair , I like her very much.
We like playing ball together , but she is not very good catching the ball.
Ashley told me she has trouble seeing the ball coming, sometimes I do to.

Our class went on a field trip .
During the trip , the teacher would point out things that she told us we should be looking at.
Ashley told me she could not see everything that the teacher was talking about.
I told her some of it looked kind of fuzzy.
Ashley told the teacher she was sorry but could not see everything you wanted us to look at.
After the trip , the teacher gave Ashley a note to take to her parents.

When Ashley s mother read the note , made an appointment to have Ashley s eyes examined .
The following week Ashley came to school wearing glasses.
I was really surprised when I saw her .
She ;looked so nice wearing glasses.
I had always thought that only older people wore glasses.
Ashley told me she loved her glasses, she could see everything now nice and clear.
She let me try her glasses , and surprisingly , everything looked so much nicer and very clear.
Now I wonder , perhaps I should be wearing glasses to.
I would not mind , I could see so much better when wearing Ashley s glasses , and I like the feel and looks of them.
When I came home after school, I told my mother all about Ashley s glasses .
That when I tried them I could see so much better.
My mother told me to forget about glasses ,I don t think you need them.

When I went into grade 3 , I really noticed that all things far away looked fuzzy.
I asked Ashley if I could try her glasses again.
I wanted to make sure that wearing glasses would improve my vision.
When I put her glasses on  noticed how well i could see everything far away so nice and clear.
Now I was sure I needed to wear glasses.
I told my mother how well I could see when wearing Ashley s glasses 
She told me to forget it , you want glasses because Ashley wears glasses.

A while later Ashley came to school wearing new glasses.
She told me they were a little stronger than her old ones.
When I tried them , I realized they were a little to strong for me , not like her old glasses.
I asked her if she would mind bringing her old glasses to school I would like to try them again.
The next day Ashley brought me her glasses, and gave them to me.
When I put them on realized I should be wearing glasses, everything looked so nice and clear.
I asked Ashley if I could wear her old glasses .
Sure if they help you to see better , you might as well wear them , I don t need them .
Now I wore Ashley s glasses everyday , and I could see so well that I hated to take them off after school.
I could not let my mother see me wearing Ashley s old glasses.

A few weeks later , my mother came to school , to bring my lunch bag  that I had forgot to take when I went to school.
I was now so used to wearing Ashley s glasses , that I forgot to take them of when I met my mother.When my mother saw me wearing glasses she was furious .
She asked the teacher what was going on.
The teacher told my mother that she had seen me wearing glasses for about 4 weeks now.3
I was sure she was prescribed glasses , and now was a regular glasses wearer 
I have noticed that Jennifer s work has improved a lot since she started to wear glasses.
If the glasses are not hers , she certainly should have an eye exam.

That day after school my mother wanted to know all about the glasses.
I told her that when I had mentioned to her that I thought I needed glasses , you told me to forget it that iI did not need glasses.
When Ashley got her new glasses , she gave me her old glasses to wear , and I can see perfect when wearing them.

When my father heard the story that night , was furious.
He told me I could wear the glasses until I got my own after a proper eye exam.
I put the glasses on , and was so happy that I could wear glasses all the time now
My dad told me I looked very cute wearing glasses

After the eye exam my prescription read - 1.75 for the right and - 1.50 for the left eye.
I had a great time trying all the frames , until I found one I really liked.
I as so excited getting my own glasses I could hardly wait.
When my glasses were ready and put them on was so happy with the nice clear vision, I could see everything now
I loved my new glasses , they looked so nice and were so comfortable.
When I came home my dad told me I looked fantastic, and my mother told me I looked nice.

The next day at school Ashley and I tried each others glasses , and our prescriptions were about the same.
I told my teacher I had my own glasses now, she told me she was happy for me , and that I looked very nice wearing glasses.
When I brought home my school report card my parents were very pleased..

When you grow older and your body grows , so does your eye glasses prescription , it sometimes even grows faster.
Then you start looking forward to your next eye exam., because it is so exciting knowing that another increase in the prescription is coming .
and new stronger looking lenses and better vision.
I am always very excited when I pick up my new glasses .
When I put hem on , with the stronger prescription always get such a nice feeling, and love the improved vision.

When I started high school , my prescription was up to - 4.25.
I love the looks of my lenses  that now start to show some rings, and the edges are a little thicker.
Wearing glasses has always given me lots of confidence.
I enjoy wearing glasses , and love the looks of stronger lenses  in a nice new cat eye frame.
Dating is no problem, there are certainly a lot of guys around who like a glasses wearing girl.

A couple of years later when I had my eye exam , and my prescription was up to -6.50, had trouble selecting a new frame.
So I would select a number of frames that I like, usually cat eye , while wearing my glasses. 
Then I sit down , put the frames on and take a selfie  picture on my phone .
That way I don t have to depend on someone else to tell me which pair looks best.
An eye exam is always so much fun , selecting a new frame , anew prescription and then patiently waiting for your new glasses.
When the glasses are ready and you put them on , to get that exciting high feeling and of course your improved vision.

Ashley is still my best friend.
Her glasses prescription did not go up very much.
It now is -3.75 and she wears contact lenses.
I have no intention of wearing contacts, I love wearing my glasses.

When I finished high school my glasses prescription read - 8.00  for the right and - 8.25 for the left eye 
I love the look of my new cat eye glasses , the stronger lenses , the rings and the thickness on the edges of the lenses and enjoy wearing them.

A while later I started to date Mark.
He is studying to become an optometrist, he is great fun.
He likes wearing his glasses, he is hyperopic.
With his prescription the lenses of his glasses magnify, and show his nice brown eyes to perfection. 
He looks so handsome wearing glasses.

On one of our dates , Mark told me he likes doing G O C .
Because I had never heard of it , he explained to me what was involved.
Doing G O C sounded very exciting to me , and I told him I would like to see him do it.

On our next date , Mark was wearing a plastic frame with, as he told me - 15 .00 lenses
I loved the look of the strong lenses, he looked fantastic wearing them
He told me that wearing the strong lenses gives him a wonderful feeling, and loves seeing everything clear and minified.
Of course I had to try the glasses , they were to strong for me .
I was able to look in a mirror wearing the glasses and just loved the looks of the lenses.
Mark asked me if I would like to do G O C ?
I told him , I would not wear contact lenses , and that I can wait,
I am sure my prescription will go higher then it is now.
I now have an idea what I will look like in the future  when wearing stronger lenses .
I can t wait for my prescription to go higher , even up to - 15.00.
I love wearing glasses with stronger lenses . I love being a myopic girl.
