description: Uncover the intriguing details of Sigmund Freud's glasses prescription and how it relates to his life.
---
So I’ve always found super Freud interesting even though I don’t necessarily agree with him. I noticed he wore glasses later in his life, but not in all of his photos. I kind of wondered what his prescription was, but I had no clue about it and I haven’t seen the glasses photos from enough angles. An optician checked Freud’s glasses at the Freud museum and they are R: +5.00 -0.75 x 20; L: +7.25 -1.25 x 68. He had a bad left eye like me and the same amount of astigmatism as me.
