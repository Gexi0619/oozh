The new glasses.




In a rural area, located on the edge of of a little river, is a bustling, little village.
Near the river, is a water powered mill, and next to it, the general store, a large blacksmith shop, a church, and a ball diamond.
With the nice friendly families that live here, makes the village a wonderful place for a young fellow, to grow up.
I am so lucky, I was born there, in 1920.
My dad, is the miller, and owns the water powered grist mill.
I have two older sisters, Margaret, and Nancy, we live in nice house, next to the ball diamond. 


In a small village, being a young boy, there is always something to do.
I love to go, and watch the blacksmith shoe a horse, and get a chance to play, with the older kids,
when they are playing ball, or other games. 
I like to help my dad at the mill, and now I know, a lot of the farmers, who come, to get their grain ground, 
for bread and animal feed..


My father’s brother Angus, has a farm about 5 miles down the road.
He and his wife Hazel, have three daughters.
When uncle Angus, came to get some grinding done at the mill, asked my dad, if I would like to spend, 
the summer on his farm, and help him with the harvest.
When my dad asked me, I told them I would like that.
My mother thought, that working for uncle Angus, for the summer, is a good idea, 
She packed the clothes, a twelve year old would need, in a feed bag, for me to take., when I was ready to go.




I hitched a ride to my uncle’s place, with one of his neighbours, who was at he mill,.
That was great, because, it would have been a long walk.
When I arrived, my aunt Hazel, who wears, glasses, greeted me, and showed me my room.
When we sat down for dinner, I had a chance, to really look at my aunt’s glasses.
I have never seen, many people who wear glasses, but I noticed, that her eyes look very small, 
and the lenses in her glasses, look very thick.
Both my nieces, Irene, and Gladys, wear glasses, but the lenses look thinner.
I have seen some old people wearing glasses, and there is only one student in our school, who wears glasses,
that makes me wonder, why both Irene and Gladys, are wearing glasses.
There is something, that fascinate me about glasses, how you can see properly, looking through lenses,
and what do you see?
I sure would like to find out.




After the harvesting was finished, Aunt Hazel, mentioned to me, that they were going to Walton, 
and, if I wanted to come, because the girls, are to have their yearly eye exam, before going back to school. 
We have go to Walton, the big town., to get that done., because there is no other optometrist, in the area
Sure, I like to go, I have never been there.




To day we are going to Walton, riding in the carriage, I am sitting next to Uncle Angus, on the drivers seat.
We stopped at the livery stable, to give the horses a drink, and to feed, and rest them, after the long trip.
Walton sure is big, there are at least three general stores, a hospital and some doctors offices.
I noticed a lot of big poles with wires on top, that I found out is, so people now have electric lights, 
instead of oil lamps, that we use at the farm.






Aunt Hazel and the girls went to the optometrist office, for their eye exams.
In the display window, there were some of the different types of glasses, that are now available.
Aunt Hazel suggested, I stay with her, while we wait for the girls, to have their eye exam.
While we were waiting, she explained to me, how the doctor examines your eyes. 
A few years ago, before there was electricity available, the doctor would use an oil lamp and a magnifying glass, 
to they check the health of your eyes.
Now they use an electric light, to check the health of your eyes, and there is a chart, with lines of letters to read, 
to find out how well a person can see,
When you cannot read all the lines, the doctor, puts a pair of trial glasses on your face, and with using different lenses,
in the trial glasses, the doctor, can make a prescription, for the lenses, in your glasses. 
Now, I know, that if you cannot see objects, in the distance clearly, you need to wear glasses.




After the exam, the optometrist told my aunt, that both girls had an increase, in their prescription.
My aunt , did not seem to be surprised.
Then they had to select, a new frame for their glasses, a gold metal frame, or a grey looking metal frame, or the latest style, 
a rimless frame.
Both girls selected, the new rimless frame, and after they had selected their new frames, we all went home, 
and arrived there, in time, to do the chores.


The next few days, whenever, I saw Irene and Gladys, I wondered, how can I find out more about glasses.
I did not dare to ask them, if I could try wearing their glasses, so I could find out, what it is like having to wear glasses.
I am sure, I am going to find out , before I go home and back to school.




The following week, the family went back to Walton, for the girls to get their new glasses.
I could not go, because I had promised, our neighbour Tom, I would help him, fix some stabling, and help him,
doing some barn repairs.


Working away, while we were fixing the barn, I lost track of the time, and was surprised, when I heard, John say,
my daughter Norma is coming to see us, lunch must be ready. 
Jim, you go the house with her, I will be in shortly.
I had not met Norma before, a very pretty, blonde haired, glasses wearing girl about my age.
I guess, she wondered, why I looked at her the way I did., and asked, is there something wrong with me.
Sorry, no there is nothing wrong with you, I think you look very nice, I was just looking at your eyeglasses., 
and wonder why so many, girls wear glasses?
Well, we do a lot of sowing and needle work, and I like reading, which I guess must be hard on the eyes.
I never tried glasses, so I have no idea, how a person can see better, looking through lenses.
Well, I will let you find out, you can try my glasses, if you like.
Yes, I would like that, and she handed me her glasses.
I put them on, and looked around, and noticed everything, that I looked at, seemed a little further away, but nice and clear.
Now, I can see, why you wear glasses, I am really surprised how, wearing the glasses improved my vision. 
John, if you can see better wearing my glasses, perhaps you should be wearing glasses.
I don’t know, I never had an eye exam.


I had a hard time, not to keep looking at Norma, while I was eating my lunch, and I noticed her smile at me.
When I was ready, to go home, Norma came to see me, John, here is something for you, and handed me a pair of glasses.
These are my first pair of glasses, before I got my present ones, I want you to have them.
Thank you, I like that, and I will start wearing the glasses, and think about you.
Walking back to uncle Angus farm, I put the glasses on, and right away, noticed a difference in my vision,
everything I looked at looked, is more defined, and clear, and I could see farms, way in the distance, that I had not seen before.
Now I know, why people wear glasses, than you can see everything
I did not have much time to think about it, because the Angus family were coming home., 
so I removed the glasses, and put them away.
After the family had gone into the house, I stabled the horses, and started doing the other chores., all the time thinking, 
of Norma, and her glasses in my pocket.


At meal time that night, I complimented the girls, on how nice they looked, wearing their new glasses.
Yes, we love our new glasses, and our improved vision.
It looks to me, that the lenses look stronger.
Yes they are, but we don’t mind.
John, have you ever had your eyes examined? 
No, but how do you know, that you need an eye exam?
Well, when you try another person’s glasses, you might realize, that your vision is not as good as it should be. 
I never had a chance, to try wearing glasses. 
Would you like to try? We have some of our old glasses around.
Irene went to her bedroom and came back, and handed me the glasses.
These glasses are my first pair of glasses, why don’t you try them.
Looking around wearing the glasses, noticed that my vision was about the same, as when I wore Norma’s glasses.
Gladys then handed me her old glasses, which had been her second pair, and the definitely were much stronger. 
I went outside to look in the distance, but the glasses were a little too strong for me.
I had no problem wearing the first pair, and now realize, that I am myopic and should be wearing glasses.
Thank you, now I know, that I , should be wearing glasses to see better.
Well if you want to, you can keep Irene’s glasses till you get your own, 
Yes John, I think that is a good idea, for you to wear the glasses, until you get your own said aunt Hazel. 
So now, I am wearing glasses, and I like wearing them, it makes me feel important.
Later that night in my room, I compared Norma’s and Irene’s glasses, the frames are identical,
but I like Norma’s glasses better, and I am going to wear them.


Just before I was going to go home, I went to visit Norma, when she saw me wearing her glasses, 
loved the way I looked, and gave me a kiss.
Norma ,I will be back to see you, I like you.


-------------------------


My dad, bought a Ford model A truck, and it did not long for me, to be able to drive it, and now have a driver’s license.
I am now working at the mill, to help my dad., and make deliveries driving the truck.
Whenever I have a chance. I phone, or go and see Norma.


I had an eye exam, and was prescribed glasses, and selected a new plastic type frame.
Norma, loves the looks, of my new plastic frame glasses, and we always like to exchange glasses, when we are together.
Our prescriptions, are almost the same, and we both love wearing glasses.




I dated Norma, as often as I could.
When I arrived at the farm to day, Norma had been crying, Dad had a stroke, and is unable to move.
I talked with her mother, and did the chores for them, and told them I will be back in the morning..
At home. I had a talk with my dad, and after I packed my clothes, went back to Norma’s place, the following morning.,
to do the chores.


A couple of days later Tom died, and after the funeral, I stayed at the farm, to get the work done.


Norma, came home to day, wearing new glasses, and I loved her new look.
I don’t know what happened, but shortly after I had gone to bed, Norma, came walking into my room, and 
crawled into my bed.
With the light, of the full moon, peeking through the window, I could see she was wearing her new glasses.
She climbed in my bed, and snuggled up to me, and well!!!!!


About two month later, Norma was sick to her stomach in the morning, her mother, who must have known, 
about Norma’s visits, to my bed room, mentioned to Norma, that she was sure that she was pregnant.


Because of the phone party lines, it was not long, that the whole neighbourhood knew, because somebody had listened in, 
on the phone conversation, when Norma’s mother, was talking to the minister of our church, about marrying us.
After a community shower, and our wedding, we are all looking forward to the birth.


Wearing new glasses, is great, and look at the result, are we having another glasses wearing person?
