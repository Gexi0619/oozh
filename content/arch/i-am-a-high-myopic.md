I am a high myopic




We are very excited about the news, that we received after my last ultrasound, the baby I am carrying is a girl.
Being parents of two healthy boys, we are now looking forward, to have a girl, in our family.


Jim and I have been married for about ten years, live in a nice house , Jim has a good job, so I can stay home,take care of the family.
Jim started to wear glasses, a short time ago, to make his computer work easier.
I have been wearing glasses, since grade 2, I am a high myopic, and wear, -12.00 glasses.
My biggest worry is, will my children inherit my myopia, because I understand, that when one or both parents,
are myopic, increases the chances of their children being myopic.
Well there is no use worrying about it, if the children are myopic they will just have to get used to wearing glasses, I did.
Our boys have regular eye exams, and according the doctor both have 20/20 vision.




We now have a daughter, Emily, a healthy, active baby.




Time goes fast, and Emily is now almost four years old.
Lately, I have noticed that Emily sits very close to the T.V., and when looking at her books,
holds them very close to her face, I am worried about that, does she have a vision problem? 
I will soon find out, because she is due for an eye exam, in a few weeks.




At Emily’s eye exam, I was quite upset, when the doctor told me, that Emily, is myopic, 
and her prescription is already -1.50, at that young a age
We discussed in detail, what might be expected.
The doctor mentioned, he would like to see Emily again, in about 6 months.
Emily, was quite excited, to get to wear glasses, she will look just like mommy and daddy.
After selecting a couple of frames, that Emily liked, we went home, and are to come back to morrow ,
to pick up Emily’s glasses.




When I told my husband about Emily, and her vision problem, he told me not to worry, you are high myopic,
and lead a normal life, Emily will grow up, and who knows, what the experts will come up with, 
and make life for a high myopic better. 
You remember the thick lenses you wore, when we were in high school, and now you look so nice,
wearing the new thin lenses.
I am sure, Emily will be a nice looking glasses wearing girl, and have a good life.




When we went to get Emily’s glasses, she was all excited, now she would look like mommy, and more grown up.
The glasses were ready, and after the optician fitted them, Emily was all smiles ,when she looked around.
She told me of all the things she could see now.
Emily told me, mommy, I love these glasses, I can see everything now,
That sure made me feel better, about Emily having to wear glasses.
I had a good look at her, she looking so cute wearing the glasses, and liked her new look.




When Emily, started to go to school, was wearing, - 3.00 glasses.
Coming home after her first day of school, told me about her nice looking teacher, who wears glasses,
and that there are only, three other students who wear glasses.




All through the years, Emily was a better student than her brothers.
While participating in sports, she always wanted to be the best.

I will tell you all about, my regular eye exams, and regular increases, for my glasses,.
While in public school, my yearly increase, in my prescription, was usually, 1/2 to 3/4 diopters, and was – 6.50
when I started puberty,.
Growing taller and developing, was not just my body, but my eye glasses prescription, went up and up, 
so much, that when I went to high school my prescription was up to -11.00


I had lots of dates, while in high school
Nothing serious, it seems to me, that when a guy takes you out, it is usually a movie, and they wonder how you can see,
wearing glasses. with that high a prescription, and like to try wearing your glasses, and telling you, you must be blind, 
wearing glasses with that strong prescription.


Thank goodness, my mother had told me to make sure, to be able to function, without wearing my glasses,
and now, I am able to find my way around, and can do a lot of things, not wearing my glasses.




My myopia, increased, every year when I had my yearly eye exam.
After graduating from high school, when I started continuing my studies, my prescription was up to – 14.00.
I enjoyed my new courses, and work hard to get good marks, because I am looking forward to a good job.




When I complained about not having a steady boy friend, and blaming it, because I wear high prescription glasses,
my mother told me to be patient, she is sure, the right person will come along.
There are men, who like a girl, who wears high prescription glasses, your dad is one of them.




During my first semester, I became a friend with Kelley, a very pleasant girl
we spend a lot of time together, and enjoyed each others company.
Kelley is a beautiful, red headed glasses wearing girl.
Kelley told me she started to wear glasses in third grade, and her present prescription is – 3.50.
She loves the looks of my strong lenses, and even, wore my glasses, so she could get a selfie, 
wearing strong prescription glasses.
Kelley mentioned a few times, how the look of my strong glasses, turns her on.




Kelley wanted me, to meet her family, and I am invited to spend a weekend at her place.
When we arrived at Kelley’s place, her parents greeted me, and made me feel welcome.
I was supposed to sleep in Kelley’s brother room, but Kelley’s brother was expected ,to come home home for a visit, 
so I was to sleep with Kelley.
Kelley had a nice big queen size bed, so there was lots of room for the two of us.




After we had gone to bed, and spend some time talking, it was time to settle down.
What I had not expected, was for Kelley to snuggle up to me, and to start massaging my breasts.
It was a real turn on. 
Kelley., I am sorry, but I am not into girls, I prefer boys.
I had not expected, Kelley was that kind of girl.
Emily, be nice to me, and let me have a night of fun, I love you, and I like to make you feel, as going over the moon,
if you let me, and you will also experience, the best feelings you will ever have.
Well, I might as well find out, I have no sexual experience.
What a wonderful experience, now I wonder what sex with a male will be like.




To day, I met Kelley’s brother.
A well build handsome glasses wearing man.
What I liked about his glasses, was how they enlarged his eyes, which made him look very handsome.
Jim, was easy to talk to, and impressed me, the way he could keep the conversation, so enjoyable.
We went for a car ride, so he could show us, the new facility his company was building, which he is going to manage
Then he showed us the house, he had bought,
Kelley told Jim you are full of surprises, I did not know all of that.
We stopped for some refreshments,
While we wee sitting in a booth, enjoying our drinks, Jim who sat opposite of me , looked at me,
Emily, you look so beautiful, I love the way you look wearing glasses.
I almost blushed.
Thank you Jim, not to many people like the look of my strong prescription glasses.
Emily, I love the way your eyes look, behind the lenses, and the rings that show in your lenses .
You are the kind of girl, I have been looking for. I like to take you out sometime.
Well, Jim, I would like that.


Jim and I started dating, and liked each other so well, that we got married.
Now being a married woman, remember my mother saying, don’t be impatient, 
you will find the man, who likes a girl, who wears high prescription glasses.
