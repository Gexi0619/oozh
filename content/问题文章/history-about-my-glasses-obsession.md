If this is a true story, You can call me Astra . Astra is now age 33/34.
From the time when my early Girlfriend got glasses at age 9 . 
I already develop my obsession about how glasses does not Look Good.
If Glasses were (or are) beautiful. I would never develop such obsession.
Because Girls wearing Glasses was not considered fashionable or beautiful or Looks Nice or Looks Good. 
I become obsessed about those Glasses Frames that were not considered Fashionable to the Kids or Children Fashion.
I would rather develop obsession about those Glasses Frames that are Ordinary, Mundane , Typical , etc.
Back then , it was more Fashionable to have glasses with colorful frames, because those are girls at Kids or Children age. Back then I was age 8.
Colorful frames, specifically they feature a picture of vibrant colors , beautiful artwork painting on colorful frames.
It almost gets me obsessed about such colorful frames.
Because I noticed even such colorful frames are so heavy with a prescription of minus 6 for Kids or Children at age 8.
I find this especially ridiculous. Colorful frames, too blind for that Girl to see the colors. What was painted on the frame, only people with normal vision can notice the colorful details about colorful Kids or Children section. Such combination of vibrant colors, are especially typical in Kids or Children section.
