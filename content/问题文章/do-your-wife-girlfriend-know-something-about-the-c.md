I've been in a serious relationship for almost 2 years by now. In the beggining, i told her i have a fetish for glasses but didn't went too deep in the conversation. She already wore glasses while with me sometimes, but i still felt It was not enough. I wanted her to know more about my fetish and also wanted us to go deep in it. So, i recently told her more about It all and she reacted well. She even suggested to buy some non prescription glasses for her to wear. In a near foi, i will try to suggest some high graduated glasses. What's your thoughts about that? Do your wifes know something or even go along with you in the fetish?
