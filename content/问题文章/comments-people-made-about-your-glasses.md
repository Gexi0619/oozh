I'm curious to hear true stories of peoples' comments about your glasses, especially if you wear very thick spex, GOC or otherwise.

As I've gotten older and people have become more polite about disabilities, I rarely hear comments any more. But back in the day, when young people rarely needed severely thick glasses and people were generally less sensitive about disabilities, I heard comments all the time. "Wow, those are thick!" "You must be totally blind!" "How do you see through those?" "Those must be incredibly heavy to wear. Why don't you wear contacts?" Sometimes a cashier would carefully place the change for a purchase in my hand, as if I could not see it. Once in a bookstore a woman kept offering to help be find the book I was looking for. On the subway I got into a conversation with a double digit myopic woman. When I said that I thought my eyes were even worse than hers, she vigorously agreed. When I handed my prescription to an optician years ago, she said, "Wow! That's the absolute worst prescription I've ever seen!" I was sitting in my car in front of a convenience store with two girls hanging out in front. One said to the other, clearly intended for me to hear, "That guy should NOT be driving." Then there were the smiles and laughter, and a band of wild kids in a drug store who kept shouting, "coke bottles!" 

There was always a thrill in hearing these remarks.
