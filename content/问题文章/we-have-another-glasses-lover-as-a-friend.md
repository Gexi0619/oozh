Mill Town is a fast growing community, and I love living here.
I am Logan, I was born here 15 years ago.

I have two older sisters, and they both wear glasses.
I have heard them say, that they are nearsighted, and wear glasses for myopia.
They both started to wear glasses about 5 years ago.
In those days they had to go to a nearby town to get their eyes examined and get glasses.
Our town at present does not have an eye doctor.
The lenses in my sisters glasses fascinate me .
When I  face them and look at the edges of their lenses everything looks smaller and farther away.

The other day , my sister Ashley was cleaning out her dresser .
I noticed she put a glasses case in the garbage bag.
I picked the case up , and inside the case was a pair of glasses.
I asked her about them .
Oh, they are my first pair of glasses , they are of no use to me.
Taking the glasses case to my room .
I took a pair of wire rimmed glasses out of the case, and put them on.
This was the first time I ever tried wearing glasses, and looking through lenses.
Everything looked a little fuzzy but smaller and further away, very exciting.
When wearing the glasses , and looking through the lenses , I experienced a very nice feeling.
If wearing glasses feels that good , I want to wear glasses to.
I really enjoyed the feeling I got when wearing the glasses , so I started to wear them whenever I could.
Soon I could see perfect when wearing the glasses.

To day , new people moved into the house next door.
I soon met Brandon and his twin sister Katie,they were about my age.
We got together and had a great time getting to know each other 
I now have two new friends 
Both Brandon and his sister wear glasses for myopia.
They told me that they had started wearing glasses , about four years ago.
The both told me they like wearing glasses.
I had a chance to try their glasses, but they were to strong for me.
I told Brandon that I often wear my sisters old glasses, and can see perfect when wearing them.
and that I sure would like to wear glasses all the time.
Brandon told me , when I come over to your place , I will bring some of my old glasses.
Katie then asked me if I knew some nice girls , so she could make some new friends.
I promised her I would introduce her to some of my class mates.

To keep my promise to Katie , I phoned a couple of my class mates , Anna and Jenny, and told them about Katie.
They told me to tell her they would be visiting the next day.

When Brandon came to see me, thanked me for having the girls visit his sister.
I think the girls like each other ,and by the sounds of it had lots to talk about.
Here, have fun with these, I hope you like them.and handed me two glasses cases.
I opened the cases , and got all excited, looking at the glasses.
Brandon told me , his first pair were - 0.75. and the next pair  is - 1.25.
The ones I am wearing now are - 2.00, you have tried them and they are to strong for you.

When I put his first pair on , noticed they were about the same strength  as my sisters  that I have been wearing.
The next pair gave me that exciting funny feeling that I loved.
I was really surprised how well I could see wearing the - 1.25 glasses.
When I looked in the mirror wearing a pair of men s glasses , was surprised how good I looked.
Brandon told me , you look so good wearing those glasses , you better keep them
I enjoyed wearing the stronger glasses, and soon noticed an improvement in my vision.
I would have liked to wear the glasses full time, but how to explain that to the rest of my family?
It turned out easier than I had expected.

About a week later , when my mother was checking to see if I kept my room clean and tidy, 
noticed the glasses I had left lying on my dresser.
She asked me about the glasses.
I told her that after wearing Ashley s old glasses , realized that I could see better when wearing glasses.
Brandon gave me his old glasses and when I wear them I can see just fine.
My mother who is also myopic asked me why I had not complained .
She had expected that I most likely needed to wear glasses.
I told her that I never had realized that my vision was not perfect , until I tried Ashley s old glasses
When I put the glasses on , my mother told me you look very handsome, I like your new look.
If you can see better wearing the glasses, I think you might as well wear them
The new Mall is opening in a few weeks , and I understand that then we will have an eye doctor and an  optical storein town.
I will arrange for an eye exam for you.
So I proudly wore Brandon s glasses at supper that night.
Everybody told me I looked very handsome  wearing glasses , and of course they all had to know the whole story.
I was so happy I was wearing glasses now.

End of part one .the good part is coming.
