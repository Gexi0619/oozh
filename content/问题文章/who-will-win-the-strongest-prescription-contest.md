My name is Candy, my two friends are Carol and Katie.
We have been friends since grade one.
After the summer holidays we are starting high school.
We always have a great time visiting back and forth, and  like doing things that girls our age do.
All three of us love the looks of glasses, and we all would like to wear glasses.

A few weeks later when we got together , Katie surprised us, she was wearing glasses.
We told her how nice she looked , and asked her why she did not tell us she was going for an eye exam.
I wanted to surprise you girls , I wanted to be the first one having to wear glasses.
We all had to try her glasses , and were surprised how well we could see wearing them.
Katie told us her prescription is -0.50 for the right ans -0.75 for the left eye.

My mother is myopic , her lenses are quite thick on the edges , and the front of them show a lot of rings.
I love the looks of her lenses.
My two older sisters wear glasses for myopia , and they look so nice wearing their glasses.
I had an eye exam last year and was told my vision was O.K.

Being a nosy one, I went into my sisters bedroom, and looked through her drawers.
There were three glasses cases , I opened them all, and tried the glasses that were in them.
On pair was about the same lens prescription as Katie s glasses.
The next pair were stronger , I liked the fantastic feel I got when I put them on and looked around.
Surprise, I could see quite well wearing the glasses.
I put all the glasses cases back where I found them, but took the glasses I liked to my bedroom.
Now I had a pair of glasses , and pretending they were mine.
I wore the glasses as much as I could.
After a few days I could see perfect wearing the glasses.
A couple of weeks later I noticed that when I took the glasses off .everything in the distance looked blurry.
On night while I was watching T.V. my mother told me I was squinting, and is going to make an appointment for me for an eye exam.

When I went for the eye exam , I was hoping this time  I would be told I needed to wear glasses.
After the exam the doctor told me that he was very surprised about the big change in my vision.
He told me I am myopic and have some astigmatism and should wear glasses.
Selecting a frame was a lot of fun.
When my glasses were finished and I put them on , realized they were about the same prescription as the glasses I had been wearing.
What a thrill of having my own glasses.
I love wearing my new glasses , I can see so well, and they are so comfortable.

At our next get together , when the girls saw my glasses , told me how they loved my new look,
and of course had to try them.
Katie told me my prescription is stronger , and  is really surprised how well she can see  wearing them.
Carol told me she can see better wearing Katie s glasses, and is going to ask her mother about an eye exam.

About a week later Carol showed up wearing glasses .
She looked so nice wearing glasses 
She told us her prescription is - 0.75 for both eyes.
We talked about the difference in our prescriptions .
We all decided we love glasses with strong prescriptions
Since we all are growing , understand that our eyeglasses prescriptions might grow as fast or faster than we do.
Carol suggested we have a prize for the one who has the strongest prescription when we finish high school.
We all agreed it was a great suggestion.
Who is going to win????

Before going into our second year of high school , we were all due for an eye exam.
We are all excited , and are expecting we hope a big increase in our prescription.
Katie was first and her prescription now reads right eye - 1.50 , left eye - 1.75, a big increase.
She is very happy with her new glasses and her improved vision.
When I went for my eye exam , was very disapointed , my increase is only 1/2 diopter and each eye and is now the same as Katie.
Carol has an increase of 3/4 diopter for each eye and is now - 1.50 for both eyes.
All of us have just about the same prescription .
I had expected I would have the greatest increase .
I wonder if I can do something about that.

My sisters both got new glasses with increases in their prescriptions.
I now knew where they kept their old glasses, and took a pair that were -3.00 or stronger , I am not sure.
Wearing the much stronger glasses is very exciting.
I love the feeling you get when you put the glasses on, and looking through the stronger lenses for te first time.
It did not take long to have perfect vision wearing  the glasses.
Now I am having trouble seeing properly wearing my own glasses 
I know I need an eye exam, and a new prescription , and wonder how much of an increase I will get.
