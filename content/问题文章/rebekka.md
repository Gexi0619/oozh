I'm going to try something a bit different, and post this story in parts (five of them, if I've counted correctly).  The whole story is already written, so it's just a question of uploading a bit at a time.  To those who like to read whole stories, you'll have it by the end of next week.  To those of you who like to try and work out what happens next... you've got five opportunities to work it out.

But first, by way of a teaser, a dedication:

To the real Rebekka,
Whoever you are, and wherever you may be.

Thank you for inspiring this story.  God Bless You.
