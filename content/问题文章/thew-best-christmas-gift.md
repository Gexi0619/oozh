Geoff loved to play a round of golf, and usually he was pretty good.
To day certainly was not his best.
He had noticed trouble lately lining up hi ball with objects in the distance.
After he finished hi round, went to the clubhouse to have a talk with the Pro about his problem.
The Pro agreed that it looked like Geoff did everything right and could only suggest  that it might have to do with his vision, he could not think of anything else.
That night at supper hr told his wife Amy all about his golf game and his talk with the Pro.
Amy said you should get an eye exam, then you will find out if poor vision is your problem.
I will make an appointment for you.

Geoff went for his eye exam on his lunch break from work.
After the exam the doctor told him, he was myopic and had some astigmatism, and wearing should solve his problem.
The optician was very helpful  selecting a frame.
It took Geoff a long time  before he decided on a frame that he liked and thought looked good.
On the way home from work that night Geoff went to pick up his glasses.
They were ready , and when he put the glasses on and looked at himself was pleased how good he looked.
He wore his glasses on the way home, and noticed a big improvement in hi vision, which made him feel much better having to wear glasses.
When Geoff walked into his house, his 9 year old daughter Jenny came to greet him as usual.
Mommy , come and see daddy is wearing glasses
When did you get glasses You look so , I really like them.they make you look very important.
Amy hearing the conversation came over and looked at Geoff.
I love your new sophisticated look,
You look very nice wearing glasses.
Geoff told Amy he was happy with his glasses
His vision was much better now, the glasses were comfortable to wear, and he liked the looks of them.
At work Geoff received many compliments on his new look, which made him feel good.
Looking around the office he had never realized  that so many people wore glasses , and how good they looked wearing them.
There was something about the looks of glasses that started to fascinate him.
He started to take notice of anybody who wore glasses, especially girls.

Amy noticed that Geoff, when seeing a female who wore glasses, always gave them a second look.
and she wondered why?
When she talked to her neighbor Kim [ who wore glasses] about Geoff looking at girls who wore glasses, Kim told her that  a lot of men have a fetish , and were really turned on by the looks of women wearing glasses.
My husband loves it that I wear glasses, and does not like yo see me without wearing them.
Perhaps Geoff has a fetish for girls wearing glasses,
That night when Geoff cam home from work told Amy that another girl in their office had started to wear glasses , and how nice she looked.

Summer was over and Jenny went back to school,
A few weeks later Amy received a note from the school nurse that Jenny might have a vision problem, and suggested she should have her eyes checked.
So Amy took Jenny to the optical store for an eye exam.
While Amy was waiting, she looked around, she was not familiar with glasses, and there were so 
many of them
The optician suggested she should try some frames , then she could see how she would look wearing glasses.
Amy thought why not,I never tried glasses before, I might as well find out.
After trying some different frames, she was really surprised how nice she looked wearing them
While she was wearing a frame that she really liked, Jenny came out of the examination room
and spotted Amy wearing  the glasses.
Oh mammy they look great, are you going to get glasses to
No ,dear I was just trying to see what I would look like wearing glasses.
What about you?
Then the doctor came out and told Amy  that Jenny was myopic and should wear glasses.
Jenny was all excited, now she would be wearing glasses just like daddy, and look all grown up.
It did not take them long to select a frame, and were told the glasses would be ready in a couple of hours,
They went to the food court for lunch
Jenny asked here mom why she did not  buy the glasses she tried, you looked so nice wearing them.
and I am sure daddy would love to see you wearing glasses like that,

When they went to pick up Jenny s glasses, and after she put them on said.
These glasses are fantastic I can see everything so much  better now , boy they are great, I love them
That night Geoff  kept looking at Jenny and telling her how nice she looked wearing glass.
Jenny told him ,you should have seen mom, she looks beautiful wearing glasses.
Geoff got all excited, Amy are you getting glasses?
No , I was just trying some frames while waiting , and Jenny saw me wearing them.
Well I would not mind seeing you wear glasses, I really like the look of glasses, I bet you would 
beautiful wearing glasses.
Now Amy knew her husband had a fetish for glasses.
