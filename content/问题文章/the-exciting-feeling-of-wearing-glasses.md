The Jones  have 2 children, Amy a pretty blond haired girl , going into her third year  of high school
and Andrew who will be starting his second year.
Mrs Jones had made an eye appointment, so Mrs, Jones Ashley and Andrew went to the optical store in the mall, for their eye examination.
While Ashley had her exam, Andrew looked around  and tried some of the frames 
He was surprised he could look that good wearing glasses, they looked cool, and he also noticed that wearing glasses made him feel aroused, very interesting.
He found the glasses comfortable to wear, it might not be so bad having to wear glasses.

Ashley was not very happy , when she was told she should wear glasses.
Her prescription read-.0.75 for the right and - 1.00 for the left eye, and it was suggested she wear her glasses full time.
She did not want to be seen wearing glasses, she wanted contact lenses, and her mother agreed.
The optician suggested she select a frame first, and then she would fit her with contact lenses.
Andrew had his eye exam , and when he came out of the examination room , was not very happy.
He was told his eyesight was not perfect , but did not need glasses right now.
When Ashley got her glasses, Andrew thought she looked pretty  nice
Ashley told him not to tell anyone that she needed to wear glasses.
Ashley wore her contact lenses all the time and they did not seem to bother her.

One day Andrew noticed Ashley s glasses  in the bathroom.
He put the glasses on  and loved the slight distortion in his vision and the feel of the glasses on his face and he got all aroused.
He made himself feel better, then put the glasses back where he had found them , and wished they were his glasses.

Andrew s friend Brandon came over , and while they played some games on the computer told Andrew , I have to go for an eye exam next week, you  had one a little while ago, what is it like?
The exam is kind of interesting and it does not hurt,
I dont think I want to wear glasses,
Andrew said , when I tried some of the frames while I was waiting, was surprised how good I looked
wearing glasses, and I found them arousing, you will find out, there is something about wearing glasses, that makes you feel different when you wear them.
Wait a minute might be able to show you.
Andrew went to the bathroom and was happy, Ashley s glasses were there
He put the glasses on and went back to see Brandon.
Where did you get the glasses, can I try them?
Yes you can try the glasses and you will find out what it feels like wearing them
