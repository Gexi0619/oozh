It was a little after 9AM and Chase was enjoying the warmth and comfort of being curled up in bed enjoying the 2nd day of January, just letting time go by when his mom came into the room and told Chase that they were going to the mall and that he needed to be ready to go by 10AM. 

It struck Chase a bit strange, but he thought that if mom was taking him to the mall then it might be a chance to get some more stuff out of her. Being a junior in college, meant that there was fewer opportunities now for Mom to go with shopping and buy Chase stuff and Chase definitely liked his stuffJ

Being a bit cold on this morning, Chase threw his favorite comfy gear on, his black North Face fleece, his jeans, and his Sperrys and took off. Still nothing too surprising until it is that they got to the mall and once inside, Mom told Chase that he had a 10:30 appointment at the eye doctor because she thought Chase was having some trouble seeing.

Chase’s face got bright red; the thought of needing glasses had not occurred to him and frankly was beginning to freak him out. He started to blurt out some objection, but Mom was having none of it. And so they went, Chase knew it pointless to fight it, because the alternatives were not pleasant.

Mom took charge inside, talking to the receptionist, filling out the chart, doing everything that needed to be done. Chase sat in the seat, just staring at the ground, thinking and trying to convince himself that his eyes were fine, but he had a nervous feeling that this was not going to go well.

The moment came, and Chase wobbled upright and headed back with the doc. The exam was going real well for Chase or so he thought until the doctor switched charts and asked Chase to read the farthest line down he could. Chase panicked, he was sure there was a line that he was not going to be able to read. He started to squint his eyes, but the doc would have none of that. No, no, eyes fully open. Chase got through a good deal of line 5, and made a guess below.

An uneasy silence came into Chase’s head, as it seemed like hours between then and when the doc informed Chase that he was going to have Chase look through this machine. Honestly, the rest of the exam was a blur for Chase, as he read lines until he could read all of the chart clearly both far away and up close. 

Chase waited for the doctor to say the words “Chase, no big deal but you do need to be wearing glasses”. It hit like a cannonball to the stomach, he looked at the chart and it was clearer through the lenses but Chase hadn’t ever thought of glasses being a thing for him.

The walk from the exam room to the optical seemed like the longest walk of Chase’s life. And, the worst part for Chase was that his mom seemed so happy that Chase needed glasses. Ugh, what is wrong with her he thought?

The optician looked at Chase and gave him some options of what to get. Honestly, Chase did not care, but after some deliberation, they all decided on a medium size pair of black plastics for Chase. Luckily or unluckily, this being a mall optical, the glasses could be ready in an hour. 

The hour between was a time of sitting in the pizza place sullenly eating pizza, drinking his Dr. Pepper and dreading the next part. After eating and wandering, they made it back to the optical and headed to the back. Chase sat down in the chair and waited for the optician to come back out with his new glasses.

She cleaned, polished, and then placed them gingerly on Chase’s head. Chase had a weird feeling as they were placed on his face, it felt weird to have these things on his face, but looking out did see that they did make things a little easier to see. However, when he looked in the mirror, he panicked thinking he had turned into a hideous monster.

No matter what Chase’s mom and the optician could say, he wanted nothing more than to just look at the floor and looked down all the way home. When he got home, he looked up just in time to see Mom taking a pic of his new glasses. Usually, he would argue but now he just grunted and headed up to his room to crash on the bed and take a nap.

He threw the glasses on the nightstand and laid down, but then about an hour later, he got a couple texts in quick succession. He opened his phone to see what was going on. It was 3 texts from friends of his, complementing and raving on his new glasses and look. Mom had gone and put his pic on Facebook. Chase got up and went over to the laptop and went to the page, everyone was liking the new pic and commenting on how awesome he looked. 

Chase was puzzled by this, and then put on the glasses and looked again. Guess must not be too bad then; he thought and kept them in place. It seems like this holiday surprise may not be too bad after allJ
