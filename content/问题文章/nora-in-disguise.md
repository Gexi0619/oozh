Nora is 22 years old, she is a student for law in Berlin, Germany. Her family lives in a small town in Brandenburg. There are her parents and her sister Jenny, two years older than her. Nora is single now, she break with her last boyfriend three month before.
Jenny had a car-accident, she must stay in a hospital for two or thee weeks. But next week she will have a very important date in her company. She must go for her boss to Frankfurt to a conference for two days.
Both sisters looks very similar and so Jenny asks Nora to go to Frnkfurt for her. She don't have to present something, it`s only important to be there. The other collegues knew Jenny only from a video-conference. But there are a little problem: Jenny wears glasses and Noro don`t. So Jenny wants Nora lent her glasses an her dress for the conference.
Nora take the glasses, put them on and said that her sight with the glasses on were quite bad. Jenny says that they have -3,5 ond -3,25 diopers and it must be possible for Nora to accomodate when she wears them for more than 15 minutes. She had worn a female friend`s spare pair with round -6 diopters last year for a hole day with perfect eyesight, because she break her own glasses while a weekend-trip to London.
Second problem was, that Jenny always wear high heels at work and Nora don`t like it and only wars shoes with max. 2 inch heels.
So Nora get the glasses and the pums with round 4 inch heels for training in the next days. Next morning she put the glasses on and her eyesight get better while she drink coffee, but she has trouble to read on her phone. On the way to the bus to the university she had also pain with Jenny`s heels. But her eysihgt was good, very sharp and tiny. 
In the university she met her friend Pauline and she had to answer some question about her "new look". Pauline want`s to try on the glasses,put them on and said that she can see better than without. She is shortsighted with -1,5 diopters and wear her glasses for distance.
After Nora put the glasses on again it take 10 minutes for her to get her good eyesight back.
In the afternoon as she is back in der apartment her feet hurt a lot and she has heavy headache. She think that is no good idea to be in disguise!
