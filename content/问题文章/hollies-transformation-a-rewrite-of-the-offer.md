Let me introduce myself, my name is Hollie and this is the story of how I I was transformed into a beautiful  but disabled girl

It all started when I decided to go to our local mall, I was keen to do some clothes shopping as I had heard that the mall was closing, although no one knew if it was true or just some sales pitch!

Ide been shopping for ages ide bought a new dress and a nice new top, I decided to have a coffee and sit down in the cafe right in the middle of the mall. That's when I saw her a girl in a power wheelchair and a woman who I guessed was her  mother.
As they got closer I could see the girl in the wheelchair had some very strong glasses on the sort with the little disc cut into the middle of the lens, also she was wearing an orthodontic facemask!
I looked but then looked away I didn't want to be rude by staring. As I looked around the other people in the cafe the girl and her mother came to my table, mind if we join you? Said the mother
No that fine I said moving my chair back a bit to allow the girl to wheel herself  up to the table.

After they got settled an assistant from the coffee shop came over  and said good afternoon miss Smith to the mother what can I get you? Il have my usual what about you Katie? She said talking to the girl in the wheelchair il have  an orange juice please she said. I noticed she had a lisp unsurprising given the amount of metal and plastic she had in her mouth.
I said I didn't know they did table service I said the mother smiled and said they don't but as I own this mall I think I'm entitle don't you? Oh I said I'm sorry I wasn't being nasty about it I didn't know who you where, that OK mum said I should introduce myself  my name is Vicky this is my daughter Katie, I shook hands with them being extra careful with vicky, my names Hollie.
