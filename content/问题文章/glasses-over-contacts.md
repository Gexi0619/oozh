Nancy is a cute 11 yr old girl., with a big smile .
She loves the looks of glasses on people , and wished she needed to wear glasses .
Her mother who wore glasses for myopia, surprised Nancy when she came from school, and told her she had made an appointment for her to have her eyes examined.
She told Nancy she had started to wear glasses at her age, and wanted to make sure she had proper eye care.
When they entered the optical store , Nancy was very excited, all those lovely glasses. would she get her wish having to wear glasses.
Nancy enjoyed the experience of the eye exam,  and was very happy when she was told she was myopic , and gave her a prescription fore _ 1.25 lenses , she was going to wear glasses  , 
With her mothers help selected a frame she really  liked.
When her glasses were ready and she put them on , could not believe that she could see so much better.
She loved the feel and the looks of the  glasses and was a very happy girl.
Nancy loved wearing her glasses , and over the years her prescription increased.
When she went to university her prescription was _5.25 for the right and -for the left eye.
She loved the looks of her stronger lenses, and was very proud of her glasses.

At the university she met Logan, a handsome fellow , who wore glasses for myopia  with about the same prescription as hers,.
It was love at first sight.

Logan when he was  12 , had a friend  Jim who wore glasses.
When Jim got new glasses Logan asked him  if he could buy his old ones.
Jim said O K , so Logan got his own glasses he had always wanted.
He started to wear the glasses going to school, and as much as he could at other times.
It did not take long for Logan to realize , he could not see as well not wearing his glasses.

One day he forgot to take off his glasses,
His mother noticed and asked him about the glasses
Logan told his mother that he could see much better wearing Jim s old  glasses.
His mother made an appointment  to have his eyes examined, and that is when Logan started to wear his own glasses, and he loved them.
He had more increases and when he went to university, his prescription read _ 5.50 for the right and - 5.25 for the left eye, and some astigmatism.

Nancy and Logan realized very quickly that they both loved wearing glasses with stronger lenses.
and were looking forward to their next eye exam.
Both Logan and Nancy loved kissing while wearing glasses it was more exciting.

In the coffee shop at the university. they met some glasses wearing optometry  students .
When they sat down the conversation soon was all about glasses and the type of lens they liked to look at.
Logan asked if they knew anything about  G O C .
Yes we know a little about it, if you are interested, Prof Jones who loves doing  G O C himself, is willing to help anybody who is interested.
We are planning to have a club where everybody can do G O C , and we all can enjoy the look and
feel of wearing stronger prescriptions.

Both Nancy and Logan said , we will be there,
