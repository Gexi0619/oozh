Kim and Glenn Nolan , high school sweethearts, are now married about seven years .
They are the proud parents of Ashley, Jenny and a set of twin boys, Jeff and Logan.

Ashley finished kindergarten  and after the summer holidays will go into grade one.
There is a law , that any child going into grade one , must have all required vaccinations and a certificate of an eye exam by an optometrist.

I have always made sure all vaccinations were up to date.
But I am not familiar with eye exams, Glenn and I do not wear glasses.
When I talked to my neighbor who wears glasses, she told me that she went to the optometrist in the optical store in the mall.
She told me she was very satisfied with their service.
At least I know know where to go, and will make an appointment for Ashley.
I think it is nothing but a waste of time , there is nothing wrong with her vision.

When Ashley and I entered the optical store , we were greeted by a very pleasant lady.
She asked us to fill out a form.
After I handed her the completed form, she escorted us into the examination room.
This is all new to me , I never had an eye exam.
Ashley was asked to sit in the chair , and the doctor started the exam.
After shining a bright light and some other procedures.
Then the doctor placed what looked like some oversize glasses in front of her face,
And then asked Ashley to read the letters on a wall chart.

When Ashley could not read a letter , I would hear some clicks, and Ashley would say now I can see it.
The doctor sat down at her desk and did some writing.
When she stood up , she handed me a piece of paper.
This is the prescription for Ashley s glasses.
She is myopic , and has some astigmatism , she should wear her glasses all the time.
Why does she need to wear glasses?
Ashley has trouble seeing things in the distance , and with wearing glasses will have proper vision.
She never complained she could not see things far away.
That is because children do not know what proper vision is like.
With the help of the optician we selected a frame Ashley liked.
After some measurements were taken, we were told the glasses would be ready in about an hour.

the glasse were ready when we went back.
The optician helped Ashley put the glasses on , and then fitted them properly.
When she was finished asked Ashley to look around .
OH, mommy, I can t believe it , I can see everything so much better, these glasses are magic.
On the way home in the car , Ashley told me she could see the leaves on the trees , and all other thing she now could see.
When we came home , I asked Ashley for her glasses .
I tied to look through the lenses, I could not see things very well.
How come Ashley could see so well ?
Ashley put her glasses back on and said thank you mom for the glasses , I love them.

That night I talked to my husband about the day we had, and how surprised I was that Ashley needed to wear glasses.
We decided I have to study up on my knowledge about vision.
After spending some time on the computer , I now know what being farsighted and nearsighted means.
I also found out what astigmatism is all about.
Now I realize how important an eye exam is , and why people wear glasses.

Just before the next school year started , I took Ashley and Jenny, who is going into grade one, for their eye exam.
Ashley s prescription increased  to - 1.50 for the right and - 1.25 for the left eye/.
After Jenny had her exam, the doctor told me Jenny was low myopic and had some astigmatism, and should wear glasses.
I could not believe both girls having to wear glasses , at such a young age.
The doctor told me it is unfortunate, but not unusual
She suggested the girls should have another eye exam the same time next year.

The following year when Ashley went into grade three , her prescription increase another 1/2 diopter for both eyes.
Jenny s prescription is now - 1.00 for both eyes, and some astigmatism.
At least the girls were content to wear glasses,
I think they realize they have to wear them to see properly.

When Jeff and Logan were read to enter grade one, and had their eye exams , we were told their eyes were healthy and had 20/20 vision.
I was glad the boys did not need glasses.
Now I understand , that the girls prescription is expected to increase as they grow.
They might even be high myopic in their late teens or early twenties.
I have learned a lot about vision since Ashley started to wear glasses.
Since I never had an eye exam , I decided I should have one.
I would like the experience of being a patient during an eye exam, .
So I made an appointment.
