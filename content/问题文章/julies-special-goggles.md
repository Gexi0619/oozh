Julie was a 19 year old blond girl pretty in a classic sort of way, she had been working in southern Europe on a project to help poorer people in a village, but now her work wad done.
Her mother sent her some extra money so she could e joy a 2 week holiday in a hotel before returning to England that was the plan anyway
On the second morning of her break she woke up late everything was blurry it too, half an hour to clear Julie was a bit worried but just thought she was tired

By day for she had permenant blurry vision  and a headache, she went to reception to ask about a hospital or clinic that could help her.
The receptionist told her to go to the eye clinic and gave her directions to get there
2 hours later Julie arrived when she went in she was very surprised that all the nurses and staff were wearing very heavy thick lenses glasses
She approached the admin desk Hi I'm Julie I'm having trouble with blurred vision can you help?
The nurse receptionist said oh I'm sorry to hear that please come this way
They went into a room and a second nurse who Julie could just make out was called Sara was there 
OK Julie isn't it yes said Julie
Sara introduced herself and began examining Julie including taking blood samples and all the other stuff they normally do
Sara said ok Julie come with me sorry Julie said I cantt see hardly at all now
Sara said ok hang on she rummaged in a draw and pulled out a white bundle of something Julie couldn't make it out but Sara said its a rubber swim cap with special goggles attached she positioned it on Julie's head put the goggles on her and adjusted the lenses suddenly Julie could see 
I can see again she squeeled excitedly!!  

OK this is my first story here please let me know if itsOK and not breaking any rules
