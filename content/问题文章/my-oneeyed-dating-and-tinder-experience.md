 Hi!

My name is Pia and I am 22 years old.

Since my (first ever) boyfriend had dumped me 9 months ago (and I had to move to my parentâ€™s house again) some weeks ago my desire for meeting / dating guys again had started to grow!

There are 3 weak points I am fighting against:

1.I am a quite shy person 
2. I am not exactly skinny (~12 kg above average)
3. I have to wear glasses with a occlusion (frosted) lens on the right eye because of my Diplopia issues.
(similar to the ones in the picture)

I started to go out with my friend Hannah again about 3 months ago but getting to know some guys has turned out to be difficult until now.

So I decided to give it a try and registered on Tinder.
Also difficult so far.

So writing is good for the soul, I want to tell you some stories here and maybe I can learn how to improve my appearance from your feedback??
