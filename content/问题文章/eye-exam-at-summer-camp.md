This is a true story that happened to me from a long time ago. I had almost forgotten it until it recently emerged from deep in my memory. I mostly forgot about it because of its setting. It was at a YMCA summer camp that I only attended once or twice hence why I rarely think of it. 

It was the summer after 4th grade and I was going to an all-day summer camp for the first time. I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone else that was going, but fortunately I quickly made friends with many kids in my group. One of them was a kid whose name I forget, but he had just been prescribed glasses for distance. They were small brown 
rectangular wire rims probably -1.00 so he did not need them all the time and didn’t do so, but he was definitely beginning to transition into full time wear.

There were two big things that happened that summer involving his glasses which stuck deep in my memory to this day. The first pertained to one of our counselors, I think his name was Steve and he was in his 20s or 30s. I remember some things we pointed out Steve said he couldn’t see that far. One day he asked to see the -1.00 glasses and tried them on. Naturally, he totally had that “oh shit, yeah I definitely need glasses moment because I can see so much better. In fact I think he wanted to wear them all day, but they were way too small for him and looked silly. 

The second incident involved that old familiar phenomenon of “how many fingers am I holding up.” It wasn’t just Steve who was interested in the glasses, many of us were probably because this was the only kid who needed glasses in our group. This of course led to the other kids wanting to test if my slightly nearsighted friend could see how many fingers they were holding up after he disclosed that he just needs them for distance. So one kid stood somewhere between 30 and 50 feet away and held up his fingers and not surprisingly the kid could still pretty easily tell as he was not very myopic. Others joined in and tested their vision, everyone got it right. I started to brag about how I have excellent vision because the year before the doctor told me how I easily read the 20/10 line, but when it came time to put my money where my mouth was, I couldn’t see as clearly as I thought I would. I had to guess how many fingers there were and after two tries, the kid holding them up thankfully decided to save me the embarrassment and said “close enough.” This was definitely a red flag at the time, but I put it completely out of my head days later. I barely remembered it since until now and did not resort to getting glasses until I was really myopic. 

Please add your own true stories here if you have some, we have such great fiction writers here, but the true ones are my favorite and there’s quite a deficit of them
