My name is Leslie. I recently, Monday, got back from a six week camp. Last year I attended the same camp and got a crush on a boy named Doug. One day during camp I was fooling around with my roommates glasses and he saw me. He mentioned that I looked older and more attractive with them on. I have perfect vision and do not wear glasses.
We were both going to the same camp this year for six weeks, so I decided to impress him and borrowed my cousin's old glasses to wear at camp. She had just gotten a new pair. The fit me really good, and do make me look smarter. On the five hour bus ride to camp, I put the glasses on. They seemed strong and I couldn't very well with them on, but I wore them anyway, in case there were other kids on the bus going to camp as well. After about two hours or so I noticed that I could see things a lot better than when I had first put them on. I was excited about seeing Doug again, and showing him my new glasses. I planned to tell him that I had gotten them 3 weeks ago and that the Doctor told me that I needed them all the time. Also on the bu sride I pulled out my medical form and checked the glasses box and wrote in the memo that they are to be wore all the time. This was to avoid any hassle from the camp nurse about wearing them. WRONG!
Finally I arrived at camp. After check in and meeting my roommate, I sought to find Doug. He was happy to see me nad suprised that I had glasses. He said that they made me look beautiful and older. I told him my story about recently getting them and having to wear all the time.
By bed time I had a headache but could see pretty good with the glasses on. The next morning I woke with a hedache and went to the nurse to get some asprin. She looked at my medical form an asked where my glasses were. I did not think about putting them on that morning. She gave me the asprin and instructed me to wear the glasses all the time, just like the form said. She also told my councilor that I was suspose to wear glasses all the time. Now I had no choice but to wear them. I went back to my room and put them on. By the end of breakfast I found that I could see pretty well with them.
After 2 weeks I could see really well with them and didn't have any more headaches. I also hardly noticed I was wearing them. Then something strange happoned. We were in a class during the third week of camp and the instructor had each of us blindfolded for an experiment. When it was my turn I took my cousins glasses off. When the experiment was over I looked at the blackboard and found that I couldn't see a thing on it no matter how hard I tried. When I put the glasses back on, I could read everything plain as day. I became concerned at this point and thought that maybe I was just tired.
The next day of camp we went to the beach. I left the glasses in the van, so I could swim. I then realized that my vision not so good. I couldn't read the signs or see things very far away. I thought that things would get better as the day went on but they didn't. After four hours at the beach, I couldn't see any better and I also had a headache. When we got back to the van I put the glasses back on and could see perfectly. My headache also went away on the ride back. Now I was concerned that maybe I REALLY need
to wear glasses. To avoid any hassel from my councilor and roommate I wore the glasses from the time I got up until I went to bed for the last 3 weeks of camp. My vison was perfect with them on just like before I went to camp. I hardly noticed I was wearing them so much so that upon arrival home on the bus I forgot to take them off until I saw myself in the mirror exiting the bus. I quickly took them off and put into my purse.
I have been home for 4 days and cannot see very well without them and have had a headache all the time. I cannot even see the TV. I have been searching for help on the net to see how long it will take for my eyes to get back to normal. I don't want to have to wear glasses, no one in my family has glasses. What can I do to get my vision back to normal?? I can see to read ok, but that is about it. I even to an online eyetest and found my vision to be 20/200. With my cousin's glasses on it is 20/15. HELP ME!!



Hi, this is Leslie again. Thanks for your help but this is not encouraging. Wosre yet
this morning my mother took me to our family doctor for my annual school sports physical, I play volleyball at my highschool. I did not pass the eyetest. In fact I could only read the three biggest lines on the chart. I had to struggle even for that. The doctor told my mother that I needed to go to an eyedoctor, but not to worry because it is not uncommon for someone my age, 15, to experience a change in the shape of the eyes, causing nearsightedness. I could not bring myself to tell the doctor what had really happoned!! The doctor said that I would have to come back after a visit to the eyedoctor to get my signed physical card.
My mother was quite suprised that I might need glasses, since no one in our family has glasses. Anyhow, volleyball practice starts next week and I need to have my physical card to participate. My mom called several eyedoctors in the are for an appointment but all are full until after school starts. I was glad because now I will have time for my eyes to go back to normal.
Then she called a Lenscrafters at the mall, and got me an appointment for 1:00 tomorrow afternoon. What am I going to do??
Is it really possible that I ruined my eyes by wearing my cousin's glasses at camp?? I don't know what strength these glasses are, but my cousin is the same age as me, and has been wearing glasses all the time for two years. When she got them, the eyedoctor told her that she needed to wear all the time beacuse she couldn't see the board at school.
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO GET MY EYES BACK TO NORMAL??



Julian and everyone,
Do you really think that I had bad eyes before I wore my cousins glasses at camp? Maybe that is why I got use to them so easy?
I guess I really didn't really mind wearing glasses at camp, at least for the last fews weeks for I hardly noticed I had them on. The only thing is that at camp not very many people kenw me before.
If I need to wear glasses all the time now, what will all my freinds and classmates think?? Not to mention my family. What if people call me a 4eyed geek??
To be honest, I do look smarter and more attractive with glases than without, somehow they set off my facial features.
What also scares me is that if I get use to glasses will I be blind without them? My cousin says that she can't see a thing without them, everything is really blurry. She says that her eyes got worse after she got use to her glasses.
I hope that Julian is right and that maybe my eyes were getting bad before camp. I would hate to think that I caused all this just to impress a boy.
Still does anyone know what I can do to avoid
getting glasses?? If I do need them will I have to wear them all the time?? Also if I get use to glasses will my eyes get worse??
PLEASE REPLY!



I don't mean to be a pest with all these questions but here is another.
I have never been to an eye doctor.
What should I expect?
What will he do to me?



First of all I do appreciate the advice given here at this site. …………..
For you people at this site who are NORMAL, I will tell you what happoned.
The eyedoctor gave me a prescription for glasses and told me and my mother that I needed them all the time. The prescription is OD -2.25, -.50,140 OS -2.00, -.25, 150
whatever this means? He also sheduled an appointment for the next week, to check my progress.
After I got the prescription we went next door and picked out glasses. I must have tried on every pair in the store. Finally I found a pair like my cousin's. My mother says that they look very nice on me. In fact she also thinks I look better with glasses on. I also picked out a pair of sports glasses for volleyball at the recomendation of a salesperson, who indicated that with the strength of this prescription I would neeed the to see the ball.
One hour later, we went back and picked up the glasses. The salesman fitted them on me.
He then had me turn around and look out into the mall. I couldn't beleive how good I could see everything, like I had bionic eyes.
I have been wearing them all the time, my mother makes me, but its not to bad because I do look better. After about 3 or 4 days everything got really blurry without them, alot worse than after camp. My mom even bought me an alarm clock with really big numbers on it so I can see it at night.
Anyhow, I went back to the eyedoctor today. He had me read the eyechart with my glasses on first, I could read every letter on the very bottom line perfectly. He said that my corrected vision is 20/8, and that is better than most people can see who don't need glasses. Then he told me to take the glasses off. I was shocked at how bad my eyes were. I couldn't even see most of the lines on the chart, they were just a blur. He put up bigger letters until I could read them. He said that my vision without glasses is 20/250. He told me that my eyes had adjusted very well to the prescription and I needed them all the time, even to read. He also told me not to worry about the increases blurryness without them because it is normal.
My mother says that I could get contacts for Christmas if I want to.
I am worried about going to school with glasses on. Volleyball practice wasn't to bad because another girl on the team also got glasses over the summer.
My advice to anyone else DO NOT WEAR SOMEONE ELSES GLASSES I DID AND NOW I REALLY NEED THEM ALL THE TIME.
