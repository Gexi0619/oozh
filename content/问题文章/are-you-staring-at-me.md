A moving truck stopped next door and started unloading, the new neighbors were moving in.
Kevin was wondering what the new neighbors would be like, and if some body his age was moving in.
His close friend who had lived next door had moved and Kevin missed him, they would have started high school together, they had been friends for a long time.
Kevin was not very athletic, he played some baseball and liked riding his bike, but loved reading and searching his computer best of all.

Kevin who wanted to find out what the new neighbors were like, went to the door and introduced himself and asked if they needed any help.
Mrs Jones thanked him and asked if he would mind coming tomorrow, they would like to find out all about the neighborhood.
The next morning Kevin went next door and rang the bell and waited.
A very pretty girl about Kevin's age opened the door.
Hi I am Megan come in and meet the rest of the family.
Kevin followed Megan into the living room where he met Megan s younger sister Kelley, and said hello to Mrs. Jones.
They all had lots of questions about the neighborhood, schools, recreation facilities where to go grocery shopping and the mall.

Kevin who had never paid to much attention to girls, could not get over the way Megan impressed him
She was developing in all the right places, had beautiful dark blond hair, a very pretty face and she wore glasses, there was something special about that girl that impressed him, but he did not know what it was.

Kevin asked Mrs. Jones, if Megan could go for a bike ride with him, so he could show her the area.
Mrs Jones thought it was a great idea and gave her permission, and Megan said she would like to go.
They had a great afternoon, Kevin showed her where the high school was, the sports fields  and park.
When he took Megan home she asked him If he would like to take her to the mall the next day and he told her he like to take her there.
When at home Kevin wondered what made Megan so attractive.
He had looked at girls before, but was never attracted to any of  them, the way he was to Megan.
He wondered what it was that made her so special, and made him feel so different.
She had nice hair in an attractive style, a good figure, a pleasant smile, and beautiful blue eyes that sparkled behind the lenses of her glasses.
That was it,  the glasses, the glasses made her look so nice and attractive, it was her glasses.
All he knew about glasses was that his parents used them for reading, and a few students at school wore glasses, but had never paid any attention to anybody wearing glasses.
Using his computer, he soon learned about myopia and hyperopia, what took place during an eye exam, and the type of lenses used to correct vision.
It was all very interesting and he realized there was something about glasses.

In the mall at the food court Megan and Kevin were sitting facing each other while they had some refreshments.
Kevin studied Megan s glasses, and looking at he lenses of her glasses and how they minimized when he looked at the edges, really interesting.
Why are you staring at me?
I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable, but I am fascinated with the lenses of your glasses, how they minimize when at look at the edges of your lenses, everything looks so much smaller and more defined  and brighter.
Are you Myopic?
Yes I am, this is my second pair of glasses  I started to wear glasses when I was 12 yrs old , I like wearing them, they make my vision perfect, and I like the look and feel of my glasses.
You look beautiful wearing glasses , I never realized glasses could make a person look so attractive. 
I know very little about glasses , how did you find out you needed glasses ?

I had trouble seeing the blackboard in class , and the teacher send a note to my mother, and she took me to get my eyes examined.
You saw my mother wears glasses , she also is myopic,and my younger sister will have an eye exam soon , I am sure she needs glasses, myopia runs in our family.
When I look at the price list on the wall I can read  everything clearly, what about you ?
I can see some of it  and some of it is a little blurry.
Did you ever have an eye exam ?
No , I have not.
Perhaps you should , vision deteriorates without a person realizing it.
Well I don t need an eye exam, I can see perfect.

 After walking through the mall , they went home  and decided that tomorrow they would go and see a new movie that was advertised  to start  the next day.

Part 2 to follow.



Part 2
Megan enjoyed Kevin s company, he was pleasant , good looking, and well behaved.
She also had a suspicion that Kevin s vision was not as good as he thought it was. so she put her old glasses in her purse , just in case she might have to prove to him that his vision was not perfect.
When they went to the movie, Kevin asked Megan where she would like to sit.
I prefer to sit in the back, is that all right with you?
Yes that is fine with me.
After the movie had started , Kevin mentioned to Megan , that he did not think the picture waas not as sharp as usual.
When did you see your last movie?
About 6 months ago.
I think the picture looks nice and sharp, of course I wear glasses.
Do you think my eyesight is not as good as it was?
Well that is possible, would you like to try my glasses?
I never tried glasses, perhaps I should try them.
Here they are.
These glasses are to strong for me.
Here try these , and handed Kevin her old glasses

Holy Moses, I can see everything, yes the picture is nice and clear, I can't believe it.
Well I think you need glasses, but you can wear my old ones and enjoy the movie.
When the movie was finished Kevin gave Megan her old glasses back, thank you they sure made a big difference.
I guess I need glasses, but I hate the thought of it , I most likely look like a dork wearing them.
I don't think so, come with me and I will show you.
Megan took Kevin to the optical shop, and asked the optician if they could try some different frames.
Megan picked out some frames that she thought would look good and when Kevin tried them and looked at himself , had to agree he looked pretty good in some of the frames
When they returned home , Kevin s mother was outside.
Did you have a good time , yes we did said Megan, the movie was good and we also found out that Kevin needs an eye exam, ha had some trouble seeing the movie.
Are you sure ?
Yes mom when wearing Megan's old glasses I could see everything nice and clear.
Well we have to make an appointment to get your eyes checked,

At the eye exam Kevin was prescribed glasses.
With Megan and his mother's credit card they went to the optical store, selected a frame, and were told to come back in about an hour and the glasses would be ready.
When they went back , the glasses were ready, and when Kevin put them noticed a big improvement in his vision, he realizes he noticed things he had never noticed before.
When he looked in the mirror liked his new look. They went to the food court for a drink.
Megan sat there with a big smile on her face and looked at him,
Are you staring at me?
Yes I am , you look fantastic wearing glasses , I love your new look,
