This is part 1 

In a nice house , at the edge of town, surrounded by a nice lawn and bordering the woods, live the Jones family.
They are the proud parents of Amy, a very pleasant and pretty , studious girl.
Amy had always loved drawing and coloring, and had an excellent ability to blend colors , and for her age was very artistic.
On her birthday, when she turned 11, received the paint set she had asked for.
It was a nice summer day, so Amy placed all her art supplies on the patio, and started to paint the landscape behind her house , as she saw it.
She spend a long time on the painting, trying to get it just right.
Darker here and a little lighter there and some shading for contrast.
Then Amy proudly showed the painting  to her mother.
Her mother looked at it and told her it looked very nice, but wondered why she did not show any branches or leaves on the trees.
Well there are no branches that i can see, all i shows is different colors of green, and a little bit of black here and there, a blue skye
and a green lawn.
When she showed the painting to her dad that night , he told her it was beautiful, and was very proud of her.
That night while watching T.V. Amy sat at her regular spot close to the T.V. so she could enjoy the show.

A couple of weeks later, Amy and her mother went to the mall to do some shopping.
They stopped for some  refreshments at the food court, while they were enjoying their snacks her mother mentioned that she
had noticed a sign for a new store. Amy said where is it ? 
I did not notice any sign, what does it say?
Before her mother could answer , one of Amy s class mates , Ashley and her mother came over to say hello.
Amy was glad to see them, said hello and when she looked at Ashley noticed right away that she looked different, Oh she was wearing glasses.
When did you start to wear glasses?
We just picked them up at the optical store to day and then came here for some refreshments, when we noticed you and your mother, so I wanted to say hello and show you my new glasses.
I love them, I can see so much better now , and like the looks and feel of them.
What do you think?
You look very nice wearing glasses and I love the color of the frame.
Ashley s mother told Amy s mother that they had noticed Ashley squinting quite a bit  and sitting very close to the T.V., she seemed to have some trouble with her vision , so they arranged for an eye exam, and were told Ashley was myopic and needed to wear glasses.
Amy listened to the whole story and was fascinated with the glasses.
Ashley, tell me does wearing glasses make that much difference?
I notice that when I look at your eyes behind the lenses, that everything at the edges looks smaller and farther away, how can you see?
I can see very well, everything looks brighter and nicer , it looks like a whole new world.
OI find that hard to believe that wearing glasses can do that.
Would you like to try my glasses, that will give you some idea how different everything looks when wearing them.
Yes, I would like to try them.
Ashley handed Amy her glasses. She carefully looked them over and then put them on.
The glasses felt comfortable ans she liked the feel of wearing them.
When she started to look around everything seemed to look a little smaller and further away but much more defined and very clear.
she could see everything, it was unbelievable .
Mom , I can see the sign you were talking about, and I can read the menu sign,.
Everything I look at is so nice and clear.
Mom, please buy me a pair of glasses like these please. they are fantastic.
Amy s mother was very surprised about her daughters reaction. 
Ashley s mother said don t feel bad, we only just realized Ashley had a vision problem, at least there is a solution..
Amy really liked wearing the glasses and seeing so well.
but she knew she could not keep them, and slowly removed the glasses and gave them back to Ashley.

Realizing Amy had a vision problem , Mrs Jones made an appointment for an eye exam.  

Next part will be added on asap, I have had connection problems.
