Jenny a bright pretty  11 year old , is the daughter of Carla , a single mother , who works full time to make ends meet.
Carla s younger sister lives down the street with her girl friend Carrie.
Both Amy and Carrie wear glasses for myopia , and love wearing them. 
Amy has worn glasses since she was 10, and her prescription now is - 4.75
Jenny has always been very impressed by the glasses Amy and Carrie were wearing ,she likes the looks of strong glasses, and the sparkle of the lenses.
She would like to wear glasses just like that.

After the Christmas break  , Jenny s friend Kim came to school wearing glasses.
O Kim you are so  lucky, you have beautiful glasses, and look so nice wearing them.
How do you like wearing glasses?
Yes , I like wearing glasses very much, I can see better now, they feel so good , I just love them
Can I try them?
Sure you can, and hands Jenny the glasses, who quickly puts them on.
Jenny loved the feel of the glasses on her face, and was surprised that she could see so much better wearing the glasses,
She would love to have glasses just like Kim.
That night at home  Jenny said mother can I have g;lasses just like Kim, I tried her glasses and can see much better wearing her glasses,
No , you had an eye exam a couple of years ago, and you don t need glasses,besides I cannot afford 
them right now,
The next day,Jenny tells aunt Amy all about Kim s glasses , and how much better  she could see when wearing them.
Amy listened to Jenny s story , and was sure Jenny was becoming myopic..
 I would like to have glasses just like Kim, I asked mom about getting glasses , she said I don t need them and she cannot afford them.
Amy was not surprised , she had stated to wear glasses at that age,

Since Jenny had always wanted to wear glasses, she was going to get her a pair of glasses.

She took a picture of Jenny , and used it on the computer to see how Jenny would look wearing glasses,
The next time Jenny was at  her house , Amy showed her how she would look wearing glasses.
Jenny got all excited.
I would love to have glasses just like that                                                                                                                                                                        , and pointed at a frame she liked, they look so nice.
Amy agreed yes they would look very nice on you
Let s see your face, then she took some measurements for frame size and P,D.
After Jenny went home she ordered the glasses , with - 0.50 lenses, that would help her to see better.
Now she cannot wait for the glasses to arrive , and see if they will improve Jenny s vision, and of course her reaction.

about 2 weeks later the glasses arrived.
When Jenny came after school , she handed her the package.
Is this for me?
Yes it came for you in to days mail.
She carefully opened the package , and there was a glasses case,
She opened the case and there where the glasses she had seen on the computer
Are these glasses for me ? 
Yes they are your glasses , the ones you selected on the computer.
She put the glasses on and looked around , these glasses are wonderful everything looks  more clear and brighter , Just like Kim s, love them
Thank you aunt Amy , I am so happy I have my own glasses now.Can I wear the glasses all the time?
When you are here you can wear them all the time, and we will talk to your mother about wearing the glasses at other times,

             to be continued. Nic
