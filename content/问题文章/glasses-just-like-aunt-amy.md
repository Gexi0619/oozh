Jenny a bright pretty  11 year old , is the daughter of Carla , a single mother , who works full time to make ends meet.
Carla s younger sister lives down the street with her girl friend Carrie.
Both Amy and Carrie wear glasses for myopia , and love wearing them. 
Amy has worn glasses since she was 10, and her prescription now is - 4.75
Jenny has always been very impressed by the glasses Amy and Carrie were wearing ,she likes the looks of strong glasses, and the sparkle of the lenses.
She would like to wear glasses just like that.

After the Christmas break  , Jenny s friend Kim came to school wearing glasses.
O Kim you are so  lucky, you have beautiful glasses, and look so nice wearing them.
How do you like wearing glasses?
Yes , I like wearing glasses very much, I can see better now, they feel so good , I just love them
Can I try them?Like
Sure you can, and hands Jenny the glasses, who quickly puts them on.
Jenny loved the feel of the glasses on her face, and was surprised that she could see so much better wearing the glasses,
She would love to have glasses just like Kim.
That night at home  Jenny said mother can I have g;lasses just like Kim, I tried her glasses and can see much better wearing her glasses,
No , you had an eye exam a couple of years ago, and you don t need glasses,besides I cannot afford 
them right now,
The next day,Jenny tells aunt Amy all about Kim s glasses , and how much better  she could see when wearing them.
Amy listened to Jenny s story , and was sure Jenny was becoming myopic..
 I would like to have glasses just like Kim, I asked mom about getting glasses , she said I don t need them and she cannot afford them.
Amy was not surprised , she had stated to wear glasses at that age,

Since Jenny had always wanted to wear glasses, she was going to get her a pair of glasses.

She took a picture of Jenny , and used it on the computer to see how Jenny would look wearing glasses,
The next time Jenny was at  her house , Amy showed her how she would look wearing glasses.
Jenny got all excited.
I would love to have glasses just like that                                                                                                                                                                        , and pointed at a frame she liked, they look so nice.
Amy agreed yes they would look very nice on you
Let s see your face, then she took some measurements for frame size and P,D.
After Jenny went home she ordered the glasses , with - 0.50 lenses, that would help her to see better.
Now she cannot wait for the glasses to arrive , and see if they will improve Jenny s vision, and of course her reaction.

about 2 weeks later the glasses arrived.
When Jenny came after school , she handed her the package.
Is this for me?
Yes it came for you in to days mail.
She carefully opened the package , and there was a glasses case,
She opened the case and there where the glasses she had seen on the computer
Are these glasses for me ? 
Yes they are your glasses , the ones you selected on the computer.
She put the glasses on and looked around , these glasses are wonderful everything looks  more clear and brighter , Just like Kim s, love them
Thank you aunt Amy , I am so happy I have my own glasses now.Can I wear the glasses all the time?
When you are here you can wear them all the time, and we will talk to your mother about wearing the glasses at other times,

             to be continued. Nic



part 2
When Carla came to pick up Jenny was very surprised when she saw her daughter wearing glasses,
She looked so cute.
Amy where did the glasses come from?
Well Jenny always wanted to wear glasses, so I ordered her a pair on the computer.
Are they prescription glasses?
Don t worry worry about that, those lenses won t hurt her eyes.
M

- m , can I keep the glasses and wear them all time ?
  Well if that is what you want, it is all right with me,
  You look very nice wearing glasses,
  The next day Jenny wore her glasses to school.
  When Kim saw her, she wanted to try Jenny s glasses, and the girls agreed the prescription was the same.
  Jenny loved wearing the glasses,she could see better now and they were very comfortable to wear.
  A few weeks later Jenny told Amy, that when she took her glasses off everything looked fuzzy and not as clear.
  Amy was sure now that Jenny was more myopic than she had thought,
  A couple of months , when Amy noticed Jenny squint more often, ordered Jenny another pair of glasses with the same frame , but with -1.00 lenses.
  When the new glasses came, she let Jenny try the glasses.
  Auntie I can see so much better now wearing these glasses, they are perfect, can I keep them so
  I can wear them all the time
  Yes you can wear them , but don t tell your mother that hey are new glasses,.
  Because Jenny was wearing the same frame as before , Carla never noticed the stronger lenses.

  It was Amy s birthday, and Carla came over for supper.
  There was always lots to talk about.
  After a while Carla mentioned that she had more headaches lately.
  Amy suggested to Carla to get her eyes examined . wearing glasses might solve your problem.
  I cannot afford glasses, they are to expensive,
  Amy showed Carla she could order her glasses on line and save her a lot of money,
  I would suggest that if you go for an eye exam to take Jenny, I think she needs her eyes checked

  The following week Carl and Jenny had their eye exam..
  Carla was prescribed glasses as she was hypreopic and had some astigmatism, she was told that with wearing glasses , she should have fewer headaches.
  Jenny did not mind when the doctor told her she had a big increase in her prescription
  Jenny s mother was very surprised Jenny needed to wear prescription glasses,
  After the exam they went to see Amy, to give her the prescription
  A my was very surprised when she saw Jenny s prescription, it was stronger than she had suspected
  she was up to -2.00 in the right and - 2.25 in the left eye
  We will take some pictures , so we can select the frames.
  It did not take them long to select attractive frames , ans Amy ordered the glasses
  Carla was very happy , when Amy told her the price of the glasses , she could afford that.

  When the glasses came in and Carla tried her new glasses . was pleased how well she could see, and how good she looked wearing the glasses.
  She received many compliments at work,
  Her vision was much better now and so far no head aches.
  She did not mind wearing glasses, they were great.

  will be continued as a comment



Jenny was dew;lighted with her new glasses, she could see better , and also the looks of the stronger lenses made her eyes loo a little different and she liked that.
'''a few months later Jenny asked Amy ,when did you start wearing glasses.?
I was 10 years old when i got my first pair, and I still have them.
Can I see them?
Yes , I have all my old glasses in the bedroom.
Amy pulled a box out of her dresser drawer, with 6 pairs of glasses , she pulled out a pair of metal framed glasses.
These were my first pair.
Jenny tried them , and said they are like my old ones.
Amy gave her another pair , these glasses are about the same as you have now, Jenny agreed.
Amy then gave her another pair, if I remember right these are - 2.75.
I had grown quite a bit , like you just have., and was about your age.
Jenny tried them , and looked in the mirror, and said yes I like these , I love the look of the lenses
and I like the frame.
They are a little to strong,but I think I like to try these and get used to wearing them.

Can I have them please.
Yes you can have them, they are most likely just about the same as you will get in your next prescription.
All the other glasses were too strong ,, and Jenny was not interested in them right now,

Jenny loved wearing Amy s old glasses, and wore them around the house.
When her mother asked he where they came from, Jenny told her they were an old pair of aunt Amy, with about the same prescription as she had now, and she really liked the gold frame.
Not long after, Jenny started to wear the glasses to school, and it did not take long for her to be comfortable wearing them all the time.
Amy asked her why she was wearing her old glasses all the time?
Jenny told her I can see better with them than my own glasses,
When are you due for an eye exam?
Not for a while, and I am sure I will have another increase in my prescription.
,I can notice it now,, and I am hoping it soon will be the same as yours, that is what I always wanted.

I love to try your glasses,, and Amy handed her the glasses,she put them on and Jenny realized they were a little to strong.
What about the glasses you had before these?
Amy went to get them and gave them to Jenny,
She put them on and was surprised she could see quite well, I love the exciting feeling I get wearing stronger glasses.
Amy told her the glasses were = 4.00, and now I am wearing -.4.75.
I like the frame on the glasses, can I have them?
I like to start wearing them now, when mom asks about my glasses, I will tell her that we ordered a new frame on line , I don t think she will notice the stronger lenses
Yea , you can have the glasses, I know you always wanted glasses as strong as mine, .and I think you will end up with a prescription stronger than mine,
Jenny started yo wear the - 4.00 glasses as much as she could
It did not take her long to feel comfortable wearing them all the time., and decided to show them to her mother.
When her mother came home, Jenny asked her how she liked her new glasses that aunt Amy had ordered for her
They look very nice, are they stronger? The lenses look different.
No, the lenses are a new type , and I like them very much.
Jenny was very happy wearing her stronger glasses, and with her improved vision did well in school, and had high marks.
She had been growing much taller and developed into a beautiful woman.
After graduating from high school, she was getting ready to go to cllege., which included an updated wardrobe and an eye exam
After the eye exam the doctor gave her a new prescription, it read, -,4.75 for the right and - 5.00 for the left eye\
She was very happy now her glasses were a little stronger than aunt Amy and that is what she had always wanted,She went to aunt Amy to show her the prescription and order new glasses,
Well I see you did it , now you have your glasses just like aunt Amy, and that is what you always wanted,
